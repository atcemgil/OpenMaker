Academic research describes DIY as behaviors where \"individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and component parts to produce transform or reconstruct material possessions including those drawn

availability lack of product quality need for customization and \\n identity \\n enhancement craftsmanship empowerment community seeking uniqueness \\n The term \"do-it-yourself\" has been associated with consumers since at least primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities \\n The phrase \"do it yourself\" had come into common usage in standard English by the 1950s \\n in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking \\n home improvement \\n and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity \\n Subsequently the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets DIY is associated with the international \\n alternative rock \\n punk rock \\n and \\n indie rock \\n music scenes \\n indymedia \\n networks \\n pirate radio \\n stations and the \\n zine \\n community In this context DIY is related to the \\n Arts and Crafts movement \\n in that it offers an alternative to modern \\n consumer culture \\n \\'s emphasis on relying on others to satisfy needs The abbreviation DIY is also widely used in the military as a way to teach commanders or other types of units to take responsibility so that they\\'d be able to do things themselves just as a preparation for their own future \\n Home improvement \\n Fashion \\n Subculture \\n Groups and Publications \\n Italian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC \\n Greek \\n structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an \"ancient \\n IKEA \\n building\" The structure was a \\n temple-like \\n building discovered at \\n Torre Satriano \\n near the southern city of \\n Potenza \\n in \\n Basilicata \\n a region where local people mingled with \\n Greeks \\n who settled along the southern coast known as \\n Magna Graecia \\n and in \\n Sicily \\n from the 8th century BC onwards Professor Christopher Smith director of the \\n British School at Rome \\n said that the discovery was \"the clearest example yet found of mason\\'s marks of the time It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way\" Much like the instruction booklets various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the \\n

The philosopher \\n Alan Watts \\n from the \" \\n Houseboat Summit \\n \" panel discussion in a edition of the \\n San Francisco Oracle \\n reflected a growing sentiment \\n Our educational system in its entirety does nothing to give us any kind of material competence In other words we don\\'t learn how to cook how to make clothes how to build houses how to make love or to do any of the absolutely

cerebral character \\n In the 1970s DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups In part this movement involved the renovation of affordable rundown older homes But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s The young visionary \\n Stewart Brand \\n working with friends

\\n Learn how and when to remove this template message \\n A \\n prosumer \\n is a person who \\n consumes \\n and \\n produces \\n media \\n It is derived from \"prosumption\" a \\n dot-com era \\n business term meaning \"production by consumers\" These terms were coined by American \\n futurist \\n Alvin Toffler \\n and were widely used by many technology writers of the time \\n \"Prosumer\" is also a trade term used from a business perspective for high-end electronic devices such as \\n digital cameras \\n meaning a price point between \"professional\" and \"consumer\" devices \\n Definitions and origins \\n General meanings of \"prosumer\" no relationship to the business term \"prosumption\" \\n Producer and consumer \\n Professional consumer \\n Non-corporate producer and consumer \\n Prosumer from company perspective \\n Prosumption \\n Impact and reception \\n Adoption \\n Influence on a company\\'s R & D budget \\n Notes \\n Definitions and origins \\n This blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative \\n self-help \\n movements that sprang up during various economic crises e g the \\n Great Depression \\n in the 1930s \\n General meanings of \"prosumer\" no relationship to the business term \"prosumption\" \\n Enthusiasts who buy products almost always technical that fall between professional and consumer grade standards in quality complexity or functionality Prosumer also commonly refers \\n to those products \\n Semiprofessional \\n \"Prosumer\" is a well-accepted category for camcorders digital cameras VCRs \"and other video playthings \" \\n These advanced product features and higher prosumer expectations lend themselves to increased customizing in Toffler\\'s product-improvement sense see the next section \\n Producer and consumer \\n Marshall McLuhan \\n and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their book \\n Take Today \\n p that with electric technology the consumer would become a producer In the book \\n The Third Wave \\n futurologist \\n Alvin Toffler \\n coined the term \"prosumer\" when he predicted that the role of producers and \\n consumers \\n would begin to blur and merge even though he described it in his book \\n Future Shock \\n from Toffler envisioned a highly saturated \\n marketplace \\n as \\n mass production \\n of \\n standardized \\n products began to satisfy basic consumer demands To continue growing \\n profit \\n businesses would initiate a process of \\n mass customization \\n that is the mass production of highly customized products \\n However to reach a high degree of customization consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying \\n design \\n requirements In a sense this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like \\n architects \\n for many decades However in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers a distinction touched upon in the \\n H+ Magazine \\n essay \\'Prosumption Architecture The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative\\' \\n Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century Along with more recently published works such as \\n Revolutionary Wealth \\n we can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the \\n prosumer \\n as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale That these concepts are having global impact and reach however can be measured in part by noting in particular Toffler\\'s popularity in \\n China \\n Discussing some of these issues with \\n Newt Gingrich \\n on \\n C-SPAN \\n \\'s \\n After Words \\n program in June Toffler mentioned that \\n The Third Wave \\n is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China just behind a work by \\n Mao Zedong \\n Don Tapscott \\n reintroduced the concept in his book \\n The Digital Economy \\n Despite several decades of usage the term only recently began to receive full theoretical elaboration \\n George Ritzer \\n and Nathan Jurgenson in a widely cited article claim that prosumption has become a salient characteristic of \\n Web \\n Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages \\n Mass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy Mass customization has ruled the food & beverage industry for years Look at how many choices we are faced with in the grocery stores and supermarkets Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names giving us thousands of choices Most consumption continues to be passive as critics of \\n television \\n recorded \\n music and \\n fast food \\n would argue Indeed people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture In \\n The Paradox of Choice Why More is Less \\n Barry Schwartz \\n argues that \\n diminishing returns \\n from a \\n confusing \\n abundance of consumer choice is producing \\n stress \\n and dissatisfaction \\n Still one key area of high-customization \\n is \\n taking place highly involved hobbyists \\n In the digital and online world Prosumer is used to describe today\\'s online buyers because not only are they consumers of products but they are able to produce their own products such as customised handbags jewellery with initials jumpers with team logos etc \\n In the field of renewable energy prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national or local distribution network whilst at other times when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places The European Unions Nobel Grid project which is part of their Horizon research and innovation programme uses the term in this way for example \\n Professional consumer \\n With customization focused on \\n leisure \\n pursuits Toffler\\'s initial combination has been largely supplanted by a second pair of blurring roles that of the \\n professional \\n and consumer In particular \\n hobbyists \\n have become ever-more demanding in the pursuits of their hobbies often rising above the level of dilettante an amateur someone who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest to the point of commanding skills equal to that of professionals Key examples of such hobbies are \\n home improvement \\n as illustrated by the rise of \\n hardware stores \\n such as \\n Home Depot \\n cooking \\n as illustrated by creation of entirely new \\n cable television \\n channels entirely dedicated to the culinary arts such as The Food Channel or \\n Food Network \\n photography \\n as illustrated by still \\n cameras \\n and \\n camcorders \\n that often are on a par with equipment used by professionals \\n This \\n professional \\n slant of the prosumer term is most common in photography which is a field that highlights prosumer \\n trends \\n Access to professional-level equipment and skills is made possible by combination of factors such as \\n high \\n disposable incomes \\n by some sectors of the population \\n increased leisure time again for some sectors of the population \\n continuously falling prices \\n of ever more advanced products especially electronics \\n media geared towards amateurs and hobbyists \\n beginning in the 1980s with the advent of \\n desktop publishing \\n a growing profusion of \\n magazines \\n to satisfy specialized interests \\n beginning in the mid-1990s with the advent of the \\n Internet \\n an even wider range of \\n websites \\n with \\n online forums \\n to pool experience \\n Pertaining to electronics are considered to be \"on the fence\" as a product of lower quality than a professional product and higher quality sometimes in the form of \\n bells and whistles \\n than a consumer product Some examples include \\n Digital camcorders \\n Still cameras \\n HDTVs \\n Tofflers Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler he saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers \\n Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities and to more sustainable lifestyles

roles are being combined so as to \\n exclude \\n or at least diminish the role of the \\n corporate \\n producer thus rather than generating higher corporate profits from \\n value-added \\n products producers would at best be reduced to supplying lower-profit \\n commodity \\n inputs Indeed the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as \\n globalization \\n automation \\n and \\n wealth concentration \\n Prosumer from company perspective \\n A fourth view of the Prosumer is from companies perspective who open up their processes and integrate end-users as prosumer for shared benefits Such motivated enthusiasts can be for instance integrated into a company\\'s R&D Other benefits are strengthened relationship with the customer and faster feedback cycles Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the \\n end-users \\n to develop final products and services In some instances end-users are creating products on their own without the interference or assistance of third parties i e companies organizations etc For example \\n Lego Mindstorms \\n allows users

Wikipedia processes and practices see \\n Category Wikipedia how-to \\n A \\n how-to \\n is an informal often short description of how to accomplish a specific task A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts may leave out details that are only important to experts and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic \\n One of the earliest how-to books was published in and entitled \\n A booke of the arte and maner how to plant and graffe all sortes of trees With divers other new practise by one of the Abbey of Saint Vincent in Fraunce \\n by \\n Leonard Mascall \\n Perhaps the best known full-length book in the genre is \\n How to Win Friends and Influence People \\n written by \\n Dale Carnegie \\n in \\n A similar concept can be seen in many of the \\n topic For Dummies \\n series of tutorials and also in many other introductory surveys entitled with the suffix \" \\n \" based on academic numberings of entry-level courses \\n Usage in the world of computers \\n How-to manuals have existed in some form for as long as people have spoken to each other Before writing they took the form of instruction in oral tradition The older generation taught the younger through proverbs and parables and when languages became written these were written down \\n citation needed \\n When writing was invented and people learned to read people began writing down their oral teaching traditions This was the birth of the how-to manual Eventually the genre broadened to include instructions for more than just common life skills Authors like Plato developed books like \\n The Republic \\n which is arguably a how-to manual about forming the perfect society Later Ovid wrote the \"Ars Amatoria \" which describes in a mock-didactic form how to seduce women The Renaissance with the rise of individualism and the advent of printed books saw texts like Machiavelli\\'s \\n The Prince \\n that could be considered \"how-to\" books of a kind Eventually how-to manuals broadened to the form that we see commonly today texts giving instructions for various pursuits like drawing painting swimming and other hobbies Now these manuals are both printed and on the internet and are easily accessed by everyone \\n citation needed \\n Usage in the world of computers \\n It is common practice to write the phrase as \"HOWTO\" in the open-source community \\n This is consistent with the traditional naming scheme for technical documentation such as \\n FAQ \\n and \\n README \\n Another possible reason is that this makes it easier to find a how-to in search engines like \\n Google \\n as searching with the words \"to\" and \"how\" does not necessarily deliver relevant search results \\n How-tos have a long history as a way of sharing knowledge on the \\n Internet \\n but are less successful than \\n FAQs \\n manuals \\n recipes \\n and \\n guides \\n In the beginning most how-tos on the Internet were the result of a complex process in which an author wrote a how-to for potential readers After \\n user added content \\n played a more and more important role on the internet in a trend that is widely referred to \\n citation needed \\n as \\n Web \\n

\\n Although OED accepts Granholm\\'s definition and credits him with the invention examples of its use before the 1960s exist \\n A source of some confusion has been Granholm\\'s jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer Phineas Burling of the firm \"Fink and Wiggles\" for \\n Funk & Wagnalls \\n as confirming the Germanic origin of the word \\n A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company Inc Fink and Wiggles are of course the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY According to Burling the word \"kludge\" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King\\'s Lynn then Bishop\\'s Lynn and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields \\n The word \"kludge\" is according to Burling derived from the same root as the German \"klug\" Dutch \\n kloog \\n Swedish \\n Klag \\n Danish \\n Klog \\n Gothic \\n Klaugen \\n Lettish \\n Kladnis \\n and Sanskrit \\n Veklaunn \\n originally meaning \"smart\" or \"witty\" In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth the word \"Kludge\" eventually came to mean \"not so smart\" or \"pretty ridiculous\" Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is \"An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts forming a distressing whole \" \\n It is in this latter sense that \"Kludge\" is used by computer hardware men Today \"kludge\" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the VAC source The building of a Kludge however is not work for amateurs There is a certain indefinable masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building The professional can spot it instantly The amateur may readily presume that \"that\\'s the way computers are\" \\n Claims about derivation from the German adjective \"klug\" meaning clever are unlikely for the following reasons \\n There is no equivalent usage in German \\n Both pronunciations of the word contain the soft \"g\" which is not present in German \\n The word emerges in English only in the 20th century \\n Yiddish \\n American Yiddish speakers use klug to mean too smart by half the reflected meaning of German klug/clever This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary as well as the pronunciation variation from German \\n European surname \\n It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge be that German Dutch or Scandinavian Even if Burling\\'s etymology were true it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers who began using the term in the 20th century could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding years \\n This \\n OED2 \\n entry also includes the verb kludge \"to improvise with a kludge or kludges\" and \\n kludgemanship \\n \"skill in designing or applying kludges\" \\n Military jargon \\n The \\n Jargon File \\n a k a \\n The New Hacker\\'s Dictionary \\n which is a \\n glossary \\n of computer programmer slang maintained by \\n Eric S Raymond \\n differentiates \\n kludge \\n from \\n kluge \\n and cites usage examples

around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and at that time used exclusively of hardware kluges\" The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from \\n naval \\n slang cf \\n jury rig \\n or printing equipment \\n Kluge \\n \"was common Navy slang in the \\n World War II \\n era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea\" A article in the \\n New York Folklore Quarterly \\n recorded the classic \\n shaggy dog story \\n \"\\'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker\\' then current in the Armed Forces in which a \\'kluge\\' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function \" \\n The term \\n kluge \\n as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to as evidenced by the article in the \\n New York Folklore Quarterly \\n but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above \\n On being drafted into the navy Murgatroyd gave his profession as \"kluge maker\" Not wanting to seem ignorant the clerk simply wrote this down Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing he said he was making a kluge and actually he was one of the world\\'s best kluge makers Not wanting to seem ignorant his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore \\n One day the admiral came to inspect the ship When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker the admiral asked him what a kluge was the first person ever to do so Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was After a couple of days he returned with a complex object \\n \"Interesting \" said the admiral \"but what does it do?\" In reply Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship As the thing sank it went \"kluge\" \\n The Jargon File further includes \\n kluge around \\n \"to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge\" \\n kluge up \\n \"to lash together a quick hack to perform a task\" After Granholm\\'s \"How to Design a Kludge\" article popularized the \\n kluge \\n variant \\n kludge \\n both were interchangeably used and confused The Jargon File concludes \\n The result of this history is a tangle Many younger U S hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation as \\'kludge\\' British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word\\'s meaning \\n Paper feeder \\n Another hypothesis dates to \"when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from \\n Oslo Norway \\n named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm\" In the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which by allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St Paul MN While the automatic feeder was a success unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being \"temperamental subject to frequent breakdowns and devilishly difficult to repair but oh so clever!\" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate and the company remained active as of Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions The Free Online Dictionary of Computing FOLDOC claims that the term kluge \"was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and at that time was used exclusively for \\n hardware \\n kluges\" \\n The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin FOLDOC goes on to say \" \\n TMRC \\n and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang see also \\n foobar \\n It seems likely that \\'kluge\\' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war many in MIT\\'s venerable \\n Building \\n which housed

origins possibly in Britain The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings However \\n kluge \\n seems to have the sense of overcomplicated while \\n kludge \\n has only the sense of poorly done \\n Cf German Kl diminutive Klchen \\n clod \\n Low Saxon klut klute Dutch kluit \\n perhaps related to Low German diminutive \\n kltje \\n \"dumpling clod\" Danish Jutland dial \\n klyt \\n \"piece of bad workmanship kludge\" \\n and Standard Danish kludder \"mess disorder\" \\n Industries \\n Aerospace engineering \\n In aerospace a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flight worthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program \\n Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first \\n US \\n space station \\n Skylab \\n Its two major components the Saturn Workshop and the \\n Apollo Telescope Mount \\n began development as separate projects the SWS was kludged from the \\n S-IVB \\n stage of the \\n Saturn 1B \\n and \\n Saturn V \\n launch vehicles the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the \\n Apollo Lunar Module \\n Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the \\n Apollo Applications Program \\n but the components were to have been launched separately then docked in orbit In the final design the SWS and ATM were launched together but for the single-launch concept to work the ATM had to pivot degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation clearing the way for the crew to dock its \\n Apollo Command/Service Module \\n at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter \\n The Airlock Module\\'s manufacturer \\n McDonnell Douglas \\n even recycled the hatch design from its \\n Gemini spacecraft \\n and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module The Skylab project managed by the \\n National Aeronautics and Space Administration \\n \\'s \\n Marshall Space Flight Center \\n was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center later \\n Johnson Space Center \\n as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight Thus MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project calling it \"the kludge\" \\n citation needed \\n Computer science \\n In modern \\n computing \\n terminology a \\n kludge \\n or often a \" \\n hack \\n \" is a solution to a problem doing a task or fixing a system that is inefficient inelegant or even unfathomable but which nevertheless more or less works To \\n kludge around something \\n is to avoid a \\n bug \\n or some difficult condition by building a kludge perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation It is somewhat similar in spirit to a \\n workaround \\n only without the grace A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished without having to make fundamental changes Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative Note that a hack might be a kludge but that \\n hack \\n could be at least in computing ironic praise for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem \\n A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge this is essentially a kind of \\n cruft \\n Something might be a kludge if it fails in \\n corner cases \\n but this is a less common sense as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage More commonly a kludge is a poorly working \\n heuristic \\n which was expected to work adequately An intimate knowledge of the context i e problem domain and/or the kludge\\'s execution environment is typically required to build a corner case kludge As a consequence they are sometimes ironically praised \\n An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the \\n Soviet Union \\n during the 1960s The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work Rather than setting up a timing system the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination \\n citation needed \\n A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a \\n computer program \\n Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates For example if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area add code which divides by two when it is used after the original code has been executed \\n In computer networking use of \\n NAT

bricolage fields the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary Many punk musicians for instance are not musically trained because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy Also careful observation and listening is not necessary it is common in spontaneous music to welcome \\'errors\\' and disharmony Like other bricolage fields bricolage music still values trusting one\\'s ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences \\n citation needed \\n Visual art \\n In art bricolage is a technique where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand and is seen as a characteristic of many \\n postmodern \\n works \\n These materials may be \\n mass-produced \\n or \"junk\" See also \\n Merz \\n polystylism \\n collage \\n assemblage \\n Bricolage can also be applied to \\n theatrical forms of improvisation \\n where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences i e an improvisation of ordering fast food One player would start with the common phrase \"How may I help you?\" \\n Bricolage is also applied in \\n interior design \\n through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is \"on hand\" Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas \\n Architecture \\n Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles \\n It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of \\n Le Corbusier \\n by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book \\n Collage City \\n suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the \\n history of architecture \\n This in contrast to someone like \\n Mies Van der Rohe \\n whom they called a \"hedgehog\" for being overly focused on a narrow concept \\n citation needed \\n Academics \\n Literature \\n In literature bricolage is affected by \\n intertextuality \\n the shaping of a text\\'s meanings by reference to other texts \\n Cultural studies \\n In \\n cultural studies \\n bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across \\n social divisions \\n to create new \\n cultural identities \\n In particular it is a feature of \\n subcultures \\n such as the \\n punk \\n movement Here objects that possess one meaning or no meaning in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new often subversive meaning For example the \\n safety pin \\n became a form of decoration in punk culture \\n Social psychology \\n The term \"psychological bricolage\" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess The term introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks Matthew J Karlesky and Fiona Lee \\n of the \\n University of Michigan \\n draws from two separate disciplines The first social bricolage was introduced by cultural anthropologist \\n Claude Lvi-Strauss \\n in Lvi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness The second \"creative cognition is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways Psychological bricolage therefore refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess \\n Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to \\n Karl E Weick \\n s notion of bricolage in organizations which is akin to Lvi-Strauss\\' notion of bricolage in societies \\n Philosophy \\n In his book \\n The Savage Mind \\n English translation French anthropologist \\n Claude Lvi-Strauss \\n used \"bricolage\" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought In his description it is opposed to the engineers\\' creative thinking which proceeds from goals to means Mythical thought according to Lvi-Strauss attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems \\n Jacques Derrida \\n extends this notion to any discourse \"If one calls \\n bricolage \\n the necessity of borrowing one\\'s concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined it must be said that every discourse is \\n bricoleur \\n \" \\n Gilles Deleuze \\n and \\n Flix Guattari \\n in their book \\n Anti-Oedipus \\n identify \\n bricolage \\n as the characteristic \\n mode of production \\n of the schizophrenic producer \\n Education \\n In the discussion of \\n constructionism \\n Seymour Papert \\n discusses two styles of solving problems Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying testing playing around \\n Joe L Kincheloe \\n has used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods In Kincheloe\\'s conception of the research bricolage diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena \\n Kincheloe theorizes a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological mimetic research orientations see Kincheloe Kincheloe & Berry \\n Information technology \\n Information systems \\n In \\n information systems \\n bricolage is used by \\n Claudio Ciborra \\n to describe the way in which \\n strategic information systems \\n SIS can be built in order to maintain successful \\n competitive advantage \\n over a longer period of time than standard SIS By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up rather than implementing it from the top-down the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the \\n organisational culture \\n that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated \\n Internet \\n In her book \\n Life on the Screen \\n Sherry Turkle \\n discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity She advocates the \"bricoleur style\" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured \"planner\" approach In this style of coding the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process In her essay \"Epistemological Pluralism\" Turkle writes \"The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes looks at the canvas and only after this contemplation decides what to do next \" \\n Visual Arts \\n The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work To reach this stage artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines as well as information from their own social identities \\n For instance the artist \\n Shirin Neshat \\n has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex creative and critical bodies of work \\n This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities \\n Business \\n Karl Weick \\n identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations \\n Intimate knowledge of resources \\n Careful observation and listening \\n Trusting one\\'s ideas \\n Self-correcting structures with feedback \\n In popular culture \\n Fashion \\n In his essay \"Subculture The Meaning of Style\" \\n Dick Hebdige \\n discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they \"appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings\" \\n The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes For example candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse The movie \\n Zoolander \\n parodies this concept with \"Derelicte\" a line of clothing made from trash \\n Television \\n MacGyver \\n is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur \\n creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects More recently Peter Hendry has continued the tradition of bricoleur in his weekly series \"What\\'s Pete doing?\" \\n The Wombles \\n a children\\'s program based on creatures living in Wimbledon Common is also a fine example of bricolage In the theme song composed by \\n Mike Batt \\n the lyrics include \"making good use of the things that they find things that the everyday folk leave behind\" \\n iCarly \\n a Nickelodeon television series in which Carly\\'s brother Spencer is a bricolage artist \\n The A-Team \\n the 80s television series uses bricolage as a means to create alternative escapes or weapons in every episode for example building from scrap a tank that fired cabbages \\n Look up \\n bricolage \\n in Wiktionary the free dictionary \\n Collage \\n Dtournement

term used by \\n amateur radio \\n operators hams to describe a collection of \\n spare parts \\n and old equipment kept to assist in building and repairing their \\n station \\n Typical items found in a junk box are electronic components such as \\n resistors \\n and \\n capacitors \\n as well as small parts such as \\n screws \\n nuts \\n and \\n bolts \\n A junk box may also contain surplus cast off or used electronic gear Radio amateurs who construct their own equipment known as \\n homebrewers \\n often have large or well stocked junk boxes \\n Description and uses \\n Use in homebrewing \\n Description and uses \\n According to some hams a well-stocked junk box is a requirement for anyone who likes to build repair or tinker with radio equipment and electronic gear Keeping an ample supply of spare electronic components provides the ham with parts to build a variety of electronic projects as well as \"spares\" of components needed for repairs Resistors capacitors transistors meters speakers wire cable and even small mechanical parts such as screws nuts and bolts are typical junk box items \\n Cannibalizing \\n or removing parts from old equipment is sometimes the only way for an individual to obtain some types of parts either because they are no longer made or can only be ordered in large quantities Cast-off or used electronic equipment make especially good additions to a junk box What non-hams may see as junk hams often see as treasure \\n Hamfests \\n surplus stores electronic swapmeets and even \\n dumpster diving \\n are often venues for hams to trade buy scrounge or salvage spare parts and components Junk boxes can range in size from small cardboard or plastic boxes to large collections that fill garages and outbuildings Many hams derive satisfaction from having an especially large junk box full of exotic and hard-to-find components Others feel that the act of tracking down parts is half the fun \\n Use in homebrewing \\n Homebrewing \\n is a slang term in amateur radio referring to building an alternative to a commercially available piece of equipment or accessory by hand \\n \"Homebrewers\" often naturally maintain a sizeable junk box and amateur radio publications have often employed the term in \\n DIY \\n project articles such as \" \\n The \\'Junker\\' Amplifier \\n \" from \\n QST \\n Oct an RF amplifier built from scrounged and junk-box parts \\n Boat anchor computer science \\n Circuit bending \\n QRP \\n Vintage amateur radio Number wire \\n Number wire \\n is a \\n \" \\n -diameter gauge of wire on the \\n British Standard Wire Gauge \\n that has entered into the cultural \\n lexicon \\n of \\n New Zealand \\n Number wire was the preferred wire gauge for sheep fencing so remote farms often had rolls of it on hand and the wire would often be used inventively to solve mechanical or structural problems \\n Accordingly the term \"number wire\" came to represent the ingenuity and resourcefulness of \\n New Zealanders \\n and the phrase \"a number wire mentality\" evolved to denote an ability to create or repair machinery using whatever scrap materials are available to hand \\n Since when \\n New Zealand adopted the metric system \\n number wire is officially referred to as mm gauge wire although the older term \\'Number wire\\' continues to be commonly applied Fencing now predominantly uses mm high-tensile wire \\n The \\n Waikato Museum \\n runs an art award named after the wire \\n cf \\n New Zealand culture \\n Agriculture in New Zealand \\n MacGyverism \\n a similar concept

furniture \\n RTA \\n also known as \\n knock-down furniture KD \\n flat pack furniture or kit furniture \\n is a form of furniture that requires customer assembly Several to many furniture components are packaged in a carton which also contains assembly instructions and necessary hardware needed for the buyer to follow in order to build the furniture item correctly \\n Ready-to-assemble furniture is popular among consumers who wish to save money on their furniture purchases by assembling the product on their own \\n and no need for delivery cost In addition to saving the consumer money flat pack furniture is generally simple to assemble and requires only the use of simple tools \\n Merchants benefit from selling ready-to-assemble furniture because furniture that is already assembled tends to be bulky and more expensive to store and to deliver Since the furniture does not need to be assembled in the factory ready-to-assemble furniture is also less expensive for the merchant to purchase Due to these many factors selling flat pack furniture is a more cost-effective method of conducting business \\n Ready-to-assemble furniture is typically packaged in a kit form with the pieces packaged in one or multiple boxes The kit may contain a number of flat parts fasteners fixings and other parts that are needed to assemble the furniture \\n A furniture assembly industry has grown up around ready-to-assemble furniture and consumers can engage a service provider to come to their home and assemble the furniture they have purchased \\n Knockdown furniture has a long history

of the open-design movement \\n Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century \\n Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing \\n More recently principles of open design have been related to the \\n free software \\n and \\n open source \\n movements \\n In \\n Eric S Raymond \\n Tim O\\'Reilly \\n and \\n Larry Augustin \\n established \"open source\" as an alternative expression to \"free software \" and in \\n Bruce Perens \\n published \\n the Open Source Definition \\n In late Dr Sepehr Kiani a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT realized that designers could benefit from open source policies and in early he convinced Dr Ryan Vallance and Dr Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications \\n Together they established the \\n Open Design Foundation \\n ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition \\n The idea of open design was taken up either simultaneously or subsequently by several other groups and individuals The principles of open design are closely similar to those of \\n open-source hardware \\n design which emerged in March when Reinoud Lamberts of the \\n Delft University of Technology \\n proposed on his Open Design Circuits website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software \\n Ronen Kadushin coined the title \"Open Design\" in his Masters thesis and the term was later formalized in the Open Design Manifesto \\n Current directions of the open-design movement \\n Play media \\n Open Source Ecology \\n open source farming and industrial machinery \\n The open-design movement currently unites two trends On one hand people apply their skills and time on projects for the \\n common good \\n perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking for \\n developing countries \\n or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies On the other hand open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who without the \\n copyleft \\n mechanism might not collaborate otherwise There is now also a third trend where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source e g 3D printing but customized local solutions for \\n sustainable development \\n Open machine design as compared to open-source software \\n The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate \\n However there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing Creating testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort time and cost required to create the physical artefact although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced see tools mentioned in the \\n fab lab \\n article \\n Open-design organizations \\n VIA OpenBook \\n reference design \\n CAD \\n visualisation \\n Open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives \\n Many of these organizations are single funded projects while a few organizations are focusing on an area needing development In some cases e g \\n Thingiverse \\n for 3D printable designs or \\n Appropedia \\n for \\n open source appropriate technology \\n organizations are making an

\\n Difficulties \\n Notable hackerspaces \\n Music Hackerspaces \\n Activities \\n Many hackerspaces support the \\n free software \\n movement \\n In general hackerspaces function as centers for peer learning and \\n knowledge sharing \\n in the form of workshops presentations and lectures They usually also offer social activities for their members such as game nights and parties Hackerspaces can be viewed as \\n open community \\n labs \\n incorporating elements of \\n machine shops \\n workshops \\n and/or \\n studios \\n where \\n hackers \\n can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things \\n Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of \\n free software \\n open hardware \\n and \\n alternative media \\n They are often physically located in \\n infoshops \\n social centers \\n adult education \\n centers public schools public libraries or on \\n university campuses \\n but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room \\n Hackerspaces with open membership became common throughout Germany in the 1990s in the orbit of the German \\n Chaos Computer Club \\n CCC with the \\n c-base \\n being probably an example The concept however was limited to less than a dozen spaces within Germany and did not spread beyond borders at first Most likely this was because initial founding costs were prohibitive for small groups without the support of a large organization like the CCC \\n In \\n Paul Bohm \\n came up with a fundraising strategy based on the \\n Street Performer Protocol \\n to build \\n Metalab \\n in Vienna Austria and became its founding director In he and others started Hackerspaces org a wiki-based website that maintains a list of many hackerspaces and documents patterns on how to start and run them As of September the community list included hackerspaces with active sites and planned sites \\n The advent of \\n crowdfunding \\n and \\n Kickstarter \\n has put the tools required to build hackerspaces within reach of an even wider audience Those tools are for example used by \\n Bilal Ghalib \\n who had previously worked on a hackerspace documentary and others to bring the hackerspace concept to the Middle East \\n Most recent studies of hackerspace in China where Internet access is heavily censored suggest that new businesses and organized tech conferences there serve to intervene in the status quo \"from within\" The first hackerspace in China \\n Xinchejian \\n opened in Shanghai in Thereafter a network of hackerspaces emerged nourishing an emerging maker culture By designing open technologies and developing new businesses Chinese makers make use of the system make fun of it altering it and provoking it DIY makers often bring and align contradictory ideas together such as copycat and open source manufacturing and DIY individual empowerment and collective change In doing so they craft a subject position beyond the common rhetoric that Chinese citizens lack creativity As a site of individual empowerment hackerspace and DIY making enable people to remake the very societal norms and material infrastructures that undergird their work and livelihood \\n Facilities \\n An artist gives a tour of one of the two machine shops in Xanadu a makerspace under the \\n aegis \\n of \\n Burning Man \\n Idaho Burners Alliance in \\n Boise \\n which is open to all \\n Makerspace layout \\n The specific tools and resources available at hackerspaces vary from place to place They typically provide space for members to work on their individual projects or to collaborate on group projects with other members Hackerspaces may also operate computer tool lending libraries \\n or physical tool lending libraries \\n The building or facility the hackerspace occupies provides physical infrastructure that members need to complete their projects In addition to space most hackerspaces provide \\n electrical power \\n computer servers \\n and \\n networking \\n with \\n Internet \\n connectivity Well-equipped hackerspaces may provide \\n machine tools \\n sewing \\n crafting \\n art fabrication \\n audio equipment \\n video projectors \\n game consoles \\n electronic instrumentation such as \\n oscilloscopes \\n and \\n signal generators \\n electronic components and raw materials for hacking and various other tools for electronics fabrication and creating things \\n Specialized \\n large-format printers \\n 3D printers \\n laser cutters \\n industrial \\n sewing machines \\n or \\n water jet cutters \\n may be available for members to use Some hackerspaces provide food storage and \\n food preparation \\n equipment and may teach courses in basic or advanced cooking \\n Organization \\n Billboard \\n promoting makerspaces \\n The individual character of a hackerspace is determined by its members Many hackerspaces are governed by elected boards selected by active members in good standing Elected officers may serve predetermined terms and help direct decisionmaking with regards to purchasing new equipment recruiting new members formulating policy conforming to safety requirements and other administrative issues \\n Membership fees \\n are usually the main income of a hackerspace but some also accept \\n external sponsors \\n Some hackerspaces in the US have \\n c \\n status or the equivalent in their jurisdiction while others have chosen to forgo tax exempt status \\n University-affiliated hackerspaces often do not charge an explicit fee but are generally limited to students staff or alumni although visiting guests from other hackerspaces are usually welcome Some hackerspaces accept volunteer labor in lieu of membership fees especially from financially limited participants In addition some hackerspaces earn income from sponsoring and staffing high-tech \\n flea markets \\n where members of the general public may buy and sell new and used equipment and supplies \\n There is a loose informal tradition at many hackerspaces of welcoming visitors from other similar organizations whether across town or internationally Free exchange of ideas skills and knowledge are encouraged especially at periodic gatherings sometimes called \"build nights\" or \"open house\" days \\n Hackerspaces and makerspaces are increasingly being included as \\n learning spaces \\n in schools \\n learning commons \\n and other educational facilities \\n Ethic \\n Hackerspaces are widely defined on hackerspaces org as community-operated physical places where people can meet and work on their projects The exact functioning of the space varies from place to place and is determined by its members and while there is no blueprint or set of guidelines to create a hackerspace they generally follow a hacker ethic \\n which include freedom in the sense of autonomy as well as of free access and circulation of information distrust of authority that is opposing the traditional industrial top-down style of organization embracing the concept of learning by doing and peer-to-peer learning processes as opposed to formal modes of learning sharing solidarity and cooperation \\n Difficulties \\n Hackerspaces can run into difficulties with \\n building codes \\n or other planning regulations which may not be designed to handle their scope of activities For example a new hackerspace in \\n Nashua New Hampshire \\n was shut down by the city after an inspection in The main issues involved ventilation of heat and toxic fumes the space was reopened after improvements were made to the building \\n The difficulties with opening hackerspaces and makerspaces within \\n non-profit organizations \\n such as schools and \\n public libraries \\n include cost space liability and availability of personnel \\n Many hackerspaces struggle to attract diverse users One national study showed makerspace users were 81% male \\n Although many women participate in some form of making 41% have backgrounds that are in the realms of arts crafts and design which are not taken as seriously in \\n maker culture \\n Because makerspaces are most often dominated by male makers 65% of whom have physical science or engineering backgrounds women with more creative backgrounds tend to feel unwelcome Makers with less technical backgrounds employ a different style of working taking time to sketch and think To more technically proficient makers this is seen as a weakness and not just a different style of working \\n Notable hackerspaces \\n A directory is maintained at the hackerspaces org \\n wiki For some other notable examples see \\n Category Hackerspace \\n Over the years many hackerspaces have grown significantly in membership operational budgets and local media attention Many have also helped establish other hackerspaces in nearby locations \\n c-base \\n from \\n Berlin \\n is recognized as one of the first independent stand-alone hackerspaces in the world not affiliated with a school university or company \\n Wired \\n writes that \"European groups particularly in Germany have a long tradition of this kind of activity\" \\n Another known German hackerspace is \\n RaumZeitLabor \\n organizer of Trollcon \\n The Geek Group \\n formed in is a budding nonprofit hackerspace in Grand Rapids Michigan that has a large following and internet presence There are various chapters around the United States Their main focus has been as an opensource hackerspace to increase STEM education accessibility and one day become an

had Arduino meetings on every Wednesday until today \\n The first Chinese hackerspace \\n Xinchejian \\n was established in Shanghai in the fall of Thereafter hackerspaces have grown in numerous cities including Beijing Shenzhen Ningbo Hangzhou and Guangzhou Chinese makers became internationally visible when the first Maker Carnival was hosted in Beijing in \\n There are over active \\n men\\'s sheds \\n in \\n Australia \\n Scotland \\n England \\n Ireland \\n Finland \\n and \\n Greece \\n as of \\n update \\n Instead of seeing themselves as \"hackers\" they describe themselves as \"shedders\" and their activities as \"shedding\" The Men\\'s Sheds Movement is many ways parallel hackerspaces in their aims although open to anyone regardless of age or gender they tend to advertise themselves as \"men in sheds\" In some ways they can be seen as the flip side of \\n working men\\'s clubs \\n as their community is drawn from a similar age group and their original aims are similar to provide recreation and education for \\n working class \\n men and their families \\n Seattle Attic was founded in the summer of as a response to the misogyny shown by the \\n brogrammer \\n culture that sees hackerspaces as \\'male\\' spaces and was the first Feminist Hackerspace in the United States \\n soon followed by \\n Double Union \\n in San Francisco \\n Their founding came as a

door frame \\n A \\n handyman \\n also known as a \\n handyperson \\n or \\n handyworker \\n is a person skilled at a wide range of repairs typically around the home These tasks include trade skills repair work \\n maintenance \\n work are both interior and exterior and are sometimes described as \"side work\" \"odd jobs\" or \"fix-up tasks\" Specifically these jobs could be light \\n plumbing \\n jobs such as fixing a leaky toilet or light \\n electric \\n jobs such as changing a light fixture \\n Handyman projects \\n Handyman businesses \\n Market estimates \\n Independent operators \\n Franchise businesses \\n Assessment of handyman options \\n Legal issues \\n Handymen in popular culture \\n List of handyman jobs \\n Handyman projects \\n One handyman project was to repair shaky stairs a wooden structure was built inside to prevent collapse \\n The term \\n handyman \\n increasingly describes a paid worker but it also includes non-paid homeowners or \\n do-it-yourselfers \\n Tasks range from minor to major from unskilled to highly skilled and include painting \\n drywall \\n repair remodeling minor plumbing work minor electrical work household carpentry sheetrock crown moulding and furniture assembly see more complete list below The term \\n handyman \\n is occasionally applied as an adjective to describe politicians or business leaders who make substantial organizational changes such as overhauling a business structure or administrative division \\n A handyman built this mailbox from particle board with hinges and exterior paint the rounded edges were made with a sander \\n Many people can do common household repairs There are resources on the Internet as well as \\n do-it-yourself \\n guide books \\n with instructions about how to complete a wide range of projects Sometimes the fix-it skill is seen as genetic and people lacking such skills are said to \"lack the handy-man gene \" \\n One trend is that fewer homeowners are inclined to do fix-up jobs perhaps because of time constraints perhaps because of lack of interest one reporter commented \"my family\\'s fix-it gene petered out before it reached my generation \" \\n A primary rule for all do-it-yourself repair work is \\n focus entirely on one thing at a time \\n For example focus on getting a nail then focus on hammering the nail but don\\'t try to do both tasks simultaneously In this manner injuries and mistakes are avoided \\n This project involved mortaring the crack between the back patio and the exterior wall to prevent water from seeping into the basement \\n Generally the job of paid handyman is low status a semi-skilled labor job It\\'s a less prestigious occupation than a specialist such as a plumber electrician or carpenter With the emergence of large national chains an effort is being made to change that perception by emphasizing professionalism and the fact that a handyman is actually a technician with multiple skills and a wide range of knowledge At the same time unpaid homeowners skilled at repairs are valued for saving money And handyman tools sometimes become useful in different places for example when a proper \\n neurological drill \\n was not available an \\n Australian \\n doctor used a handyman\\'s drill in to open a hole in the head of a 13-year-old boy to relieve pressure after a \\n brain injury \\n the boy\\'s life was saved \\n Installing kitchen cabinets is a medium-level handyman job with multiple steps \\n Handyman businesses \\n Market estimates \\n An estimate was that in the market for home-maintenance and repair spending was up 14% from to \\n Another estimate was that the market in the United States was $126 billion and was increasing by about 4% annually \\n American homes are aging one estimate was that in more than half of all homes are older than years \\n And as populations worldwide tend to become older on average and since increasingly elderly people will be less inclined and able to maintain their homes it is likely that demand for handyman services will grow \\n Independent operators \\n Many towns have handymen who work part-time for friends or family or neighbors who are skilled in a variety of tasks Sometimes they advertise in newspapers or online They vary in quality professionalism skill level and price Contractors often criticize the work of previous contractors and this practice is not limited to handymen but to all trades \\n Handymen have advertised their services through flyers and mailings in addition free websites such as \\n Craigslist \\n and \\n SkillSlate \\n help customers and handymen find each other \\n This entire porch was rebuilt by a handyman including the substructure columns railings 1x1s and moldings and door surrounds replacing a porch is a difficult project for amateurs \\n Franchise businesses \\n In there were national handyman service firms which handle such nationwide tasks as \\n public relations \\n marketing \\n advertising \\n and \\n signage \\n but sell specific territories to franchise owners A franchise contract typically gives a franchise owner the exclusive right to take service calls within a given geographical area The websites of these firms put possible customers in touch with local owners which have handymen and trucks Customers call the local numbers Typically these firms charge around $100/hour although fees vary by locality and time of year In many parts of the world there are professional handyman firms that do small home or commercial projects which claim possible advantages such as having workers who are insured and licensed Their branch offices schedule service appointments for full-time and part-time handymen to visit and make repairs and sometimes coordinate with sub-contractors \\n One \\n Lehman Brothers \\n executive after being let go from the \\n Wall Street \\n firm bought a Union New Jersey franchise from a national handyman firm \\n A franchise was approximately $110 with a franchise fee of $14 according to a spokesperson for a national handyman franchise \\n A handyman built this bathroom wall using two-by-four boards after electricians added the wires metal plates were put on studs to prevent nails and screws to hold drywall from going into electric wires a handyman added the drywall \\n Some see a benefit of franchising as \"entrepreneurship under the safety net of a tried-and-true business umbrella\" \\n but forecast a percent decrease in franchise businesses during the 2008-2009 recession \\n In according to a survey released by the Washington-based International Franchise Association showed franchised establishments in the United States employing some million people \\n Franchises offer training \\n advertising \\n and \\n information technology \\n support lower procurement costs and access to a network of established operators \\n Franchise handyman firms sometimes pitch clients by asking prospective customers about their unresolved \"to-do lists \" \\n The firm does odd jobs \\n carpentry \\n and \\n repairs \\n Trends such as a \"poverty of time\" and a \"glut of unhandy husbands\" has spurred the business \\n Technicians do a range of services including tile work painting and wallpapering \\n One firm charges $88 per hour \\n The firm targets a work category which full-fledged remodelers and contractors find unprofitable \\n A consumer was quoted by a reporter explaining the decision to hire one firm \"\\'I couldn\\'t find anyone to come in and help me because the jobs were too small\\' said Meg Beck of Huntington who needed some painting and carpentry done She turned to one franchise firm and said she liked the fact that the service has well-marked trucks and uniformed technicians and that a dispatcher called with the names of the crew before they showed up \" \\n There are indications that these businesses are growing \\n There are different firms operating \\n Other competitors include online referral services \\n In addition some large home centers offer installation services for products such as cabinets and carpet installation \\n Sometimes homeowners contact a professional service after trying but failing to do repair work themselves in one instance a \\n Minneapolis \\n homeowner attempted a project but called a technician to finish the project and the overall cost was substantial \\n Assessment of handyman options \\n Handymen have been hired to de-clutter \\n basements \\n and build movable \\n shelves \\n How well do the franchise chains perform? One \\n Wall Street Journal \\n reporting team did an informal assessment by hiring \"handymen all over the country and asked them to fix a wide range of problems from a relatively routine leaky faucet to a sticky door \" \\n The reporter concluded that \"with few licensing requirements and standards for the industry prices are all over the board \" \\n One quote was ten times as large as another \\n Further the reporter concluded \"A big corporate name is no guarantee of quality or speedy service \" \\n One corporate firm took three weeks to fix a stuck door \\n Service varied from spotty to good with complaints about unreturned phone calls service people standing on dining room chairs leaving holes between wood planking but liked getting multiple jobs done instead of just one \\n Customers liked handymen wearing hospital booties to avoid tracking dirt in houses \\n The reporter chronicled one experience with repairing a water-damaged ceiling A franchise firm fixed it for $1 a second non-franchise local handyman fixed a similar ceiling for $125 \\n The reporter preferred the second worker despite the fact that he \"doesn\\'t have a fancy van -- or carry proof of insurance \" \\n Tips for selecting a good handyman include ask questions get written estimates on company stationery make sure handymen guarantee their work pay with \\n credit cards \\n or checks because this provides an additional record of each transaction check references and licenses \\n review feedback about the contractors from Internet sites To find a competent worker one can seek referrals from local sources such as a school or church or office park to see if a staff handyman does projects on the side as well as ask friends for referrals a general contractor might have workers who do projects on the side as well \\n Further one can try out a new handyman with easy projects such as cleaning gutters to see how well they perform \\n Tiling is another medium-level handyman job which most homeowners can do successfully provided they follow directions carefully \\n Legal issues \\n Generally in the United States there are few legal issues if an unpaid homeowner works on a project within their own home with some exceptions Some jurisdictions require paid handymen to be \\n licensed \\n and/or \\n insured \\n New Jersey \\n for example requires all handymen who work in for-profit businesses serving residential and commercial customers to be registered and insured \\n Often handymen are barred from major \\n plumbing \\n electrical wiring \\n or \\n gas-fitting \\n projects for safety reasons and authorities sometimes require workers to be licensed in particular trades However minor plumbing work such as fixing water taps connecting sinks fixing leaks or installing new washing machines are usually permitted to be done without licensing Many handymen are insured under a property damage liability policy so that accidental property damage from negligence or accidents are covered \\n Handymen in popular culture \\n The handyman image recurs in popular culture There have been songs about handymen recorded by \\n Elvis Presley \\n in \\n Del Shannon \\n in \\n James Taylor \\n in \\n There are femme-fatale TV characters who fall for handymen \\n Handymen have been portrayed in books and films generally positively as do-gooder helpful types but not particularly smart or ambitious In a book by author \\n Carolyn See \\n called \\n The Handyman \\n a handyman is really an aspiring but discouraged artist who transforms the lives of people he works for as well as having sexual encounters with some of his clients and his experiences improve his artistic output \\n The book suggests handymen discover \"the appalling loneliness of the women who call him for help\" whose needs are sometimes \"comic \" sometimes \"heartbreaking \" and deep down \"sexual \" \\n A movie called \\n The Handyman \\n was about a carpenter-plumber who was \"good at what he does\" but is \"too honest and trusting \" and gets taken advantage of by \"women who find him handsome and understanding \" the movie earned negative reviews from critic \\n Vincent Canby \\n Other movies have used a rather tired formula of sexy-handyman meets bored-housewives such as \\n The Ups and Downs of a Handyman \\n a movie in which \"Handsome Bob also finds he\\'s a fast favorite with the local housewives who seem to have more than small repairs on their minds \" \\n In \\n Canada \\n there\\'s a television show called \\n Canada\\'s Worst Handyman \\n which is a reality show in which handyman contestants try their best on jobs in order to \\n not \\n be labeled \\n worst handyman \\n Home Improvement \\n is an American television sitcom starring \\n Tim Allen \\n which aired to On the children\\'s television show \\n Mister Rogers\\' Neighborhood \\n Handyman Negri \\n was one of the characters residing in The Neighborhood of Make-Believe as well as the neighborhood Mister Rogers resides in \\n Handy Manny \\n is an American/Hispanic preschool television show that airs on \\n Disney Junior \\n and stars a handy man cartoon character named Manny The Belgian comics and media franchise \\n The Smurfs \\n depicts \\n Handy Smurf \\n with traditional handyman\\'s accoutrements such as overalls carpenter\\'s pencil and work hat \\n List of handyman jobs \\n The list of projects which handymen can do is extensive and varies from easy-to-learn tasks which take little time such as changing a light bulb to extensive projects which require multiple steps such as \\n

or design experimenting with second-hand electronics in a DIY fashion Inexpensive keyboards \\n drum machines \\n and electronic children\\'s toys not necessarily designed for music production are commonly used Haphazard modifications can result in short circuits resulting in the risk of fire burning or electrocution \\n Aesthetic value immediate usability and highly randomized results are often factors in the process of successfully bending electronics Although the history of \\n electronic music \\n is often associated with unconventional sonic results such innovators as \\n Robert Moog \\n and \\n Lon Theremin \\n were \\n electrical engineers \\n and more concerned with the consistency and sound design of their instruments Circuit bending is typified by inconsistencies in instruments built in an unscientific manner While many pre-fitted circuit bent machines are on offer for sale at auction sites such as \\n eBay \\n this somewhat contravenes the intention of most practitioners Machines bent to a repeated configuration are more analogous to the well known practice of \"mods\" such as the Devilfish mod for the \\n Roland TB-303 \\n the famous \\n Speak and Spell \\n toys or various \\n Analogman \\n or Pedaldoc guitar pedal circuit modifications \\n Circuit bending an audio device typically involves removing the rear panel of the device and connecting any two circuit locations with a \"jumper\" wire sending current from one part of the circuit into another Results are monitored through either the device\\'s internal speaker or by connecting an amplifier to the speaker output If an interesting effect is achieved this connection would be marked for future reference or kept active by either soldering a new connection or bridging it with \\n crocodile clips \\n Often other components are inserted at these points such as pushbuttons or switches to turn the effect on or off or components such as \\n resistors \\n or \\n capacitors \\n to change the quality of the audio output This is repeated on a trial and error basis Other components added into the circuit can give the performer more expressiveness such as \\n potentiometers \\n photoresistors \\n for reaction to light and pressure sensors \\n A Yamaha PSR-6 used in a circuit bending project \\n The simplest input and the one most identified with circuit bending is the body contact \\n where the performer\\'s touch causes the circuit to change the sound Often metal knobs plates screws or studs are wired to these circuit points to give easier access to these points from the outside the case of the device \\n Since creative experimentation \\n is a key element to the practice of circuit bending there is always a possibility that short circuiting may yield undesirable results including component failure In particular connecting the power supply or a capacitor directly to a computer chip lead can destroy the chip and make the device inoperable Before beginning to do circuit bending a person should learn the basic risk factors about working with electrical and electronic products including how to identify capacitors which can give a person a serious shock due to the electrical charge that they store and how to avoid risks with \\n AC power \\n For safety reasons a circuit bender should have a few basic electronics tools such as a \\n multimeter \\n an electronic testing device which measures voltage resistance and other factors It is advised that beginner circuit benders should \\n never \\n \"bend\" any device that gets its power from \\n mains electricity \\n household AC power as this would carry a serious risk of electrocution Circuit bending can also be carried out in interactive electronic \\n audio games \\n People modify their electronic games to enhance the quality of recordings used for fan-made projects or to change the speed of the game which results in a pitch change This makes the gameplay easier especially if the game gets impossibly fast Adding a knob or a switch to change the pitch of the game can lead to some disadvantages which include the game can change its\\' pitch slightly when it\\'s lights are turned on and it can cause the batteries to drain out quickly on high speeds \\n Innovators \\n Although similar methods were previously used by other musicians and engineers this method of music creation is believed to have been pioneered by \\n Reed Ghazala \\n in the 1960s Ghazala\\'s experience with circuit-bending began in when a toy \\n transistor \\n amplifier \\n by chance shorted-out against a metal object in his desk drawer resulting in a stream of unusual sounds \\n While Ghazala says that he was not the first circuit bender he coined the term Circuit Bending \\n and whole-heartedly promoted the proliferation of the concept and practice through his writings and internet site earning him the title \"Father of Circuit Bending\" \\n Serge Tcherepnin \\n designer of the \\n Serge modular synthesizers \\n discussed \\n his early experiments in the 1950s with the \\n transistor radio \\n in which he found sensitive circuit points in those simple electronic devices and brought them out to \"body contacts\" on the plastic chassis Prior to Mark\\'s and Reed\\'s experiments other pioneers also explored the body-contact idea one of the earliest being \\n Thaddeus Cahill \\n whose \\n telharmonium \\n it is reported was also touch-sensitive \\n Since Swiss duo \\n Voice Crack \\n created music by manipulating common electronic devices in a practice they termed \"cracked everyday

variety of additive manufacturing techniques United States and global \\n technical standards \\n use the official term \\n additive manufacturing \\n for this broader sense ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of AM processes within its meaning binder jetting directed energy deposition material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion sheet lamination and vat photopolymerization \\n

of the 2000s \\n As the various additive processes matured it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only \\n metalworking \\n process done under that type of control a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer It was during this decade that the term \\n subtractive manufacturing \\n appeared as a \\n retronym \\n for the large family of machining processes with metal removal as their common theme At this time the term \\n 3D printing \\n still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds and the term \\n AM \\n was likelier to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer/inkjet/stereolithography enthusiasts \\n By the early 2010s the terms \\n 3D printing \\n and \\n additive manufacturing \\n evolved \\n senses \\n in which they were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media and the other used more formally by industrial AM end use part producers AM machine manufacturers and global technical standards organizations Until recently the term \\n 3D printing \\n has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability \\n Both terms reflect the simple fact that the technologies all share the common theme of sequential-layer material addition/joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control Other terms that had been used as AM synonyms although sometimes as \\n hypernyms \\n included \\n desktop manufacturing \\n rapid manufacturing \\n agile tooling \\n as the logical production-level successor to \\n rapid prototyping \\n and \\n on-demand manufacturing \\n which echoes \\n on-demand printing \\n in the 2D sense of \\n printing \\n The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets \\n and large nuts \\n would be grown either before or instead of machining in \\n job production \\n rather than \\n obligately \\n being machined from \\n bar stock \\n or plate Today the term \\n subtractive \\n has not replaced the term \\n machining \\n instead \\n complementing \\n it when a term that covers any removal method is needed It is still the case that casting fabrication stamping and machining are more prevalent than AM in metalworking but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads and with the advantages of \\n design for additive manufacturing \\n it is clear to engineers that much more is to come \\n Agile tooling \\n is a term used to describe the process of using modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick \\n prototyping \\n and responses to tooling and fixture needs Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs It can be used in \\n hydro-forming \\n stamping \\n injection molding \\n and other manufacturing processes \\n Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s \\n In Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening \\n thermoset polymer \\n where the \\n UV exposure \\n area is controlled by a \\n mask pattern \\n or a scanning fiber transmitter \\n On July \\n Alain Le Mhaut \\n Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr filed their patent for the \\n stereolithography \\n process \\n The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company now Alcatel-Alsthom and CILAS The Laser Consortium \\n The claimed reason was \"for lack of business perspective\" \\n Three weeks later in \\n Chuck Hull \\n of \\n 3D Systems \\n Corporation \\n filed his own patent for a \\n stereolithography \\n fabrication system in which layers are added by curing \\n photopolymers \\n with \\n ultraviolet light \\n lasers \\n Hull defined the process as a \"system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed \" \\n Hull\\'s contribution was the \\n STL Stereolithography file format \\n and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today \\n The technology used by most 3D printers to dateespecially hobbyist and consumer-oriented modelsis \\n fused deposition modeling \\n a special application of plastic \\n extrusion \\n developed in by \\n S Scott Crump \\n and commercialized by his company \\n Stratasys \\n which marketed its first FDM machine in \\n The term \\n 3D printing \\n originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom \\n inkjet \\n print heads developed at \\n MIT \\n in and commercialized by \\n Z Corporation \\n The year also saw the start of a company called \\n Solidscape \\n introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures categorized as a \"dot-on-dot\" technique \\n AM processes for metal sintering or melting such as \\n selective laser sintering \\n direct metal laser sintering \\n and \\n selective laser melting \\n usually went by their own individual names in the 1980s and 1990s At the time all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive \\n casting \\n fabrication \\n stamping \\n and \\n machining \\n although plenty of \\n automation \\n was applied to those technologies such as by \\n robot welding \\n and \\n CNC \\n the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of \\n raw material \\n into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal rather than adding it such as CNC \\n milling \\n CNC \\n EDM \\n and many others But the automated techniques that \\n added \\n metal which would later be called additive manufacturing were beginning to challenge that assumption By the mid-1990s new techniques for material deposition were developed at \\n Stanford \\n and \\n Carnegie Mellon University \\n including microcasting \\n and sprayed materials \\n Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common enabling new object geometries \\n As technology matured several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in \\n sustainable development \\n in the developing world \\n General principles \\n Modeling \\n 3D modeling \\n 3D printable models may be created with a \\n computer-aided design \\n CAD package via a \\n 3D scanner \\n or by a plain \\n digital camera \\n and \\n photogrammetry software \\n 3D printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors and can be corrected before printing allowing verification in the design of the object before it is printed \\n CAD \\n model used for 3D printing \\n The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object creating a digital model based on it \\n Printing \\n Play media \\n Timelapse \\n video of a \\n hyperboloid \\n object designed by \\n George W Hart \\n made of \\n PLA \\n using a RepRap \"Prusa Mendel\" 3D printer for molten polymer deposition \\n Before printing a 3D model from an \\n STL \\n file it must first be examined for errors Most \\n CAD \\n applications produce errors in output STL files \\n holes faces normals self-intersections noise shells or manifold errors \\n A step in the STL generation known as \"repair\" fixes such problems in the original model \\n Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through \\n 3D scanning \\n often have more of these errors \\n This is due to how 3D scanning works-as it is often by point to point acquisition reconstruction will include errors in most cases \\n Once completed the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a \"slicer \" which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a \\n G-code \\n file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer \\n FDM printers \\n citation needed \\n This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software which loads the G-code and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process \\n Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X-Y resolution in \\n dots per inch \\n dpi or \\n micrometers \\n m Typical layer thickness is around \\n m \\n DPI \\n although some machines can print layers as thin as m 600DPI \\n X-Y resolution is comparable to that of \\n laser printers \\n The particles 3D dots are around to m to 250DPI in diameter \\n citation needed \\n Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously \\n Traditional techniques like \\n injection moulding \\n can be less expensive for manufacturing \\n polymer \\n products in high quantities but additive manufacturing can be faster more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer \\n Seemingly \\n paradoxic \\n more complex objects can be cheaper for 3D printing production than less complex objects \\n Finishing \\n Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material \\n with a higher-resolution subtractive process can achieve greater precision \\n Some printable polymers such as \\n ABS \\n allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes \\n based on \\n acetone \\n or similar solvents \\n Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously and would not necessarily require painting \\n Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print \\n All of the commercialized metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition A new process for the \\n GMAW \\n 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove \\n aluminum \\n or \\n steel \\n Processes and printers \\n 3D printing processes \\n Schematic representation of the 3D printing technique known as Fused Filament Fabrication a filament \\n a \\n of plastic material is fed through a heated moving head \\n b \\n that melts and extrudes it depositing it layer after layer in the desired shape \\n c \\n A moving platform \\n e \\n lowers after each layer is deposited For this kind of technology additional vertical support structures \\n d \\n are needed to sustain overhanging parts \\n Play media \\n A timelapse video of a robot model logo of \\n Make magazine \\n being printed using FDM on a RepRapPro Fisher printer \\n A large number of additive processes are available The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object \\n Others sometimes use standard off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed costs of the 3D printer of the printed prototype choice and cost of the materials and color capabilities \\n Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold which is then used to make metal parts \\n Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers In \\n Fused filament fabrication \\n also known as \\n Fused deposition modeling \\n FDM the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers A filament of \\n thermoplastic \\n metal wire or other material is fed into an \\n extrusion \\n nozzle head \\n 3D printer extruder \\n which heats the material and turns the flow on and off FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece \\n Laser sintering techniques include \\n selective laser sintering \\n with both metals and polymers and \\n direct metal laser sintering \\n Selective laser melting \\n does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals \\n Electron beam melting \\n is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts e g \\n titanium alloys \\n EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum \\n Another method consists of an \\n inkjet 3D printing \\n system which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder \\n plaster \\n or \\n resins \\n and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process With \\n laminated object manufacturing \\n thin layers are cut to shape and joined together \\n Schematic representation of Stereolithography a light-emitting device \\n a \\n laser or DLP selectively illuminate the transparent bottom \\n c \\n of a tank \\n b \\n filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin the solidified resin \\n d \\n is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform \\n e \\n Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies such as \\n stereolithography \\n Photopolymerization \\n is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid Inkjet printer systems like the \\n Objet PolyJet \\n system spray \\n photopolymer \\n materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers between and 30m until the part is completed Each photopolymer layer is \\n cured \\n with UV light after it is jetted producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately without post-curing Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in \\n multiphoton \\n photopolymerisation Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts \\n Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using \\n LEDs \\n In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer \\n Continuous liquid interface production \\n begins with a pool of liquid \\n photopolymer \\n resin \\n Part of the pool bottom is transparent to \\n ultraviolet light \\n the \"window\" which causes the resin to solidify The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object \\n In powder-fed directed-energy deposition a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment \\n As of October additive manufacturing systems were on the market that ranged from $2 to $500 in price and were employed in industries including aerospace architecture automotive defense and medical replacements among many others For example \\n General Electric \\n uses the high-end model to build parts for \\n turbines \\n Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping before mass production methods are employed Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional 3D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator \\n Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller 3D printers for educational and community access \\n Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable 3D printers for home desktop use Much of this work has been driven by and targeted at \\n DIY \\n / \\n Maker \\n /enthusiast/ \\n early adopter \\n communities with additional ties to the academic and \\n hacker \\n communities \\n Applications \\n Applications of 3D printing \\n The \\n Audi RSQ \\n was made with rapid prototyping industrial \\n KUKA \\n robots \\n 3D printed human skull from computed computer tomography data \\n 3D printed sculpture of the Egyptian Pharaoh \\n Merankhre Mentuhotep \\n shown at \\n Threeding \\n In the current scenario 3D printing or AM has been used in manufacturing medical industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing or AM to become successful commercial technology \\n The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the \\n toolroom \\n end of the manufacturing spectrum For example \\n rapid prototyping \\n was one of the earliest additive variants and its mission was to reduce the \\n lead time \\n and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling turning and precision grinding \\n In the 2010s additive manufacturing entered \\n production \\n to a much greater extent \\n Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food layer by layer into three-dimensional objects A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates such as chocolate and candy and flat foods such as crackers pasta \\n and pizza \\n 3D printing has entered the world of clothing with fashion designers experimenting with 3D-printed \\n bikinis \\n shoes and dresses \\n In commercial production Nike is using 3D printing to prototype and manufacture the Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football and New Balance is 3D manufacturing custom-fit shoes for athletes \\n 3D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer grade eyewear with on-demand custom fit and styling although they cannot print the lenses On-demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping \\n In cars trucks and aircraft AM is beginning to transform both \\n unibody \\n and \\n fuselage \\n design and production and \\n powertrain \\n design and production For example \\n In early Swedish \\n supercar \\n manufacturer \\n Koenigsegg \\n announced the One a supercar that utilizes many components that were 3D

\\n Israeli Air Force \\n has also purchased a 3D printer to print spare parts \\n In \\n GE Aviation \\n revealed that it had used \\n design for additive manufacturing \\n to create a helicopter engine with parts instead of with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of \\n supply chains \\n AM\\'s impact on firearms involves two dimensions new manufacturing methods for established companies and new possibilities for the making of \\n do-it-yourself \\n firearms In the US-based group \\n Defense Distributed \\n disclosed plans to design a working plastic \\n 3D printed firearm \\n \"that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer \" \\n After Defense Distributed released their plans questions were raised regarding the effects that 3D printing and widespread consumer-level \\n CNC \\n machining \\n may have on \\n gun control \\n effectiveness \\n Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have a history beginning in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning \\n Patient-matched implants were a natural extension of this work leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual \\n Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success \\n clarification needed \\n One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia \\n developed at the University of Michigan The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants metals is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest area of future development using the custom 3D printing technology \\n In March surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident \\n As of \\n update \\n 3D \\n bio-printing \\n technology has been studied by \\n biotechnology \\n firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet techniques In this process layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems \\n Recently a heart-on-chip has been created which matches properties of cells \\n In academic journals had begun to report on the possible artistic applications of 3D printing technology \\n As of domestic 3D printing was mainly practiced by hobbyists and enthusiasts However little was used for practical household applications for example ornamental objects Some practical examples include a working clock \\n and \\n gears \\n printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes \\n Web sites associated with home 3D printing tended to include backscratchers coat hooks door knobs etc \\n 3D printing and open source 3D printers in particular are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom \\n Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented \"revolution\" in \\n STEM \\n education \\n The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for \\n rapid prototyping \\n in the classroom by students but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from \\n open hardware \\n designs forming \\n open-source labs \\n Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment \\n In the last several years 3D printing has been intensively used by in the \\n cultural heritage \\n field for preservation restoration and dissemination purposes \\n Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased 3D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics \\n The \\n Metropolitan Museum of Art \\n and the \\n British Museum \\n have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops \\n Other museums like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum have gone further and sell through the online platform \\n Threeding \\n digital models of their artifacts created using \\n Artec 3D \\n scanners in 3D printing friendly file format which everyone can 3D print at home \\n 3D printed soft \\n actuators \\n is a growing application of 3D printing technology which has found its place in the 3D printing applications These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices post processing/assembly and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators Thus 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical functional and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external \\n joints \\n adhesives \\n and \\n fasteners \\n Legal aspects \\n Intellectual property \\n Free hardware \\n 3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes including \\n patents \\n industrial design rights \\n copyright \\n and \\n trademark \\n may apply However there is not much \\n jurisprudence \\n to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals and hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use for non-profit distribution or for sale \\n Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing or the distribution or sale of the printed item To be allowed to do these things where an active intellectual property was involved a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence which may come with conditions and a price However many patent design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for \\'private\\' \\'non-commercial\\' use of inventions designs or works of art protected under intellectual property IP That standard limitation or exception may leave such private non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights \\n Patents cover inventions including processes machines manufactures and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries but generally years from the date of application Therefore if a type of wheel is patented printing using or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent \\n Copyright covers an expression \\n in a tangible fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70years thereafter \\n If someone makes a statue they may have copyright on the look of that statue so if someone sees that statue they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue \\n When a feature has both artistic copyrightable and functional patentable merits when the question has appeared in US court the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item \\n In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing for example the design of a useful device to be registered as a whole as an industrial design on the understanding that in case of unauthorized copying only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent \\n Gun legislation and administration \\n The US \\n Department of Homeland Security \\n and the \\n Joint Regional Intelligence Center \\n released a memo stating that \"significant advances in three-dimensional 3D printing capabilities availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns \" and that \"proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter but cannot completely prevent their production Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music movie or software files \" \\n Internationally where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt as alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable \\n Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws \\n Europol \\n stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as the technology improved the risks of an effect would increase \\n Downloads of the plans from the UK Germany Spain and Brazil were heavy \\n Attempting to restrict the distribution over the Internet of gun plans has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of \\n DeCSS \\n which enabled DVD \\n ripping \\n After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans they were still widely available via \\n The Pirate Bay \\n and other file sharing sites \\n Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them being used for printing guns \\n 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile could cripple the 3D printing industry and could infringe on free speech rights with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor \\n Hod Lipson \\n suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead \\n Health and safety \\n Play media \\n A video on research done on printer emissions \\n Nanoparticle Safety \\n A \\n National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \\n NIOSH report noted particle emissions from a 3D printer peaked a few minutes after printing started and returned to baseline levels minutes after printing ended \\n Emissions from 3D printers can include a large number of \\n ultrafine particles \\n and \\n volatile organic compounds \\n VOCs \\n In desktop 3D printers potential health risks from emissions vary by filament type and color due to differences in size chemical properties and quantity of emitted particles Some of the chemical emissions have been linked to \\n asthma \\n The problem was reduced by using manufacturer-supplied covers and full enclosures using proper \\n ventilation \\n keeping workers away from the printer using \\n respirators \\n turning off the printer if it jammed and using lower emission printers and filaments \\n At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for 3D printing \\n Impact \\n Additive manufacturing starting with today\\'s infancy period requires manufacturing firms to be flexible \\n ever-improving \\n users of all available technologies to remain competitive Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter \\n globalization \\n as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations \\n The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production however is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely \\n The \\n futurologist \\n Jeremy Rifkin \\n claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a \\n third industrial revolution \\n succeeding the \\n production line \\n assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century \\n Social change \\n Since the 1950s a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology \\n Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people\\'s homes the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded \\n Likewise it has also been suggested that as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less \\n Finally given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available \\n As 3D printers became more accessible to consumers online social platforms have developed to support the community \\n This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models \\n RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone Furthermore there are other sites such as \\n Pinshape \\n Thingiverse \\n and \\n MyMiniFactory \\n which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users creating communities dedicated to 3D printing \\n Some call attention to the conjunction of \\n Commons-based peer production \\n with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques \\n The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope and here society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity \\n Further it is true that many issues problems and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production and especially regarding the physical ones \\n For instance the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned weapons manufacturing could become easier not to mention the implications for counterfeiting \\n and on IP \\n It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale \\n Commons-based peer production \\n 3D printing could develop economies of scope While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation the economies of scope share infrastructure costs intangible and tangible productive resources taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools \\n And following Neil Gershenfeld \\n in that \"some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies \" Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs \\n Larry Summers \\n wrote about the \"devastating consequences\" of 3D printing and other technologies robots artificial intelligence etc for those who perform routine tasks In his view \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing And the trends are all in the wrong direction particularly for the less skilled as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead \" Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" e g tax havens bank secrecy money laundering and regulatory arbitrage enabling the holders of great wealth to \"avoid paying\" income and estate taxes and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return including more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements improvements in corporate governance strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers and increased public and private investment in infrastructure developmente g in energy production and transportation \\n Michael Spence \\n wrote that \"Now comes a powerful wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks This process of labor substitution and \\n disintermediation \\n has been underway for some time in service sectorsthink of ATMs online banking enterprise resource planning customer relationship management mobile payment systems and much more This revolution is spreading to the production of goods where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor \" In his view the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start in the design of hardware e g 3D printers and more important in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks \"Once this is achieved the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low and declines as scale rises and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing the incentives to invest in digital technologies are compelling \" Spence believes that unlike prior digital technologies which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor \" For example as the cost of 3D printing technology declines it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized Moreover production may occur in response to actual demand not anticipated or forecast demand Spence believes that labor no matter how inexpensive will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion with labor-intensive process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries In his view production will not disappear but it will be less labor-intensive and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion Spence writes that \"the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital not goods services and traditional capital Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets policies investments especially in human capital and quite possibly models of employment and distribution \" \\n Design portal \\n Book 3D printing \\n 3D bioprinting \\n 3D Manufacturing Format \\n
