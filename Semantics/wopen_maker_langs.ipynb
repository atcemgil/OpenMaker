the status of a \\n dependent territory \\n Definition of independence \\n Distinction between independence and autonomy \\n Declarations of independence \\n Historical overview \\n Continents \\n Notes \\n Definition of independence \\n Whether the attainment of independence is different from \\n revolution \\n has long been contested and has often been debated over the question of \\n violence \\n as \\n legitimate \\n means to achieving sovereignty \\n While some revolutions seek and achieve national independence others aim only to redistribute power with or without an element of emancipation such as in \\n democratization \\n within \\n a state which as such may remain unaltered The \\n Russian October Revolution \\n for example was not intended to seek national independence though it did result in independence for \\n Poland \\n Finland \\n Lithuania \\n Latvia \\n and \\n Estonia \\n In contrast the \\n American Revolutionary War \\n was intended to achieve independence from the beginning Causes for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many The means can extend from peaceful demonstrations like in the case of the \\n Indian independence movement \\n to a \\n violent war \\n like in the case of \\n Algeria \\n Distinction between independence and autonomy \\n Autonomy \\n refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing \\n authority \\n that itself still retains ultimate authority over that territory see \\n Devolution \\n A \\n protectorate \\n refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous region \\n Declarations of independence \\n Sometimes a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will issue a \\n declaration of independence \\n the earliest surviving example is \\n Scotland \\n \\'s \\n Declaration of Arbroath \\n in with the most recent example being \\n Azawad \\n \\'s declaration of independence in Declaring independence and attaining it however are quite different A well-known successful example is the \\n U S Declaration of Independence \\n issued in The dates of established independence or less commonly the commencement of revolution are typically celebrated as a national \\n holiday \\n known as an \\n independence day \\n Historical overview \\n Historically there have been three major periods of declaring independence \\n from the 1770s beginning with the \\n American Revolutionary War \\n through the 1830s when the last royalist bastions fell at the close of the \\n Spanish American wars of

For more specific articles and other uses see \\n Freedom disambiguation \\n Freedom \\n generally is having an ability to act or change without constraint A thing is \"free\" if it can change its state easily and is not constrained in its present state In philosophy and religion it is associated with having \\n free will \\n and being without undue or unjust constraints or \\n enslavement \\n and is an idea closely related to the concept of \\n liberty \\n A person has the freedom to do things that will not in theory or in practice be prevented by other forces Outside of the human realm freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension A rusty lock might be oiled so that the key has freedom to turn undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling freedom to grow or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom In mechanical engineering \"freedom\" describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or system which is generally referred to as \\n degrees of freedom \\n \" \\n Free will \\n Social freedom or liberty \\n Freedom as a physical concept \\n Freedom in mathematical theory \\n Free will \\n Free will \\n In philosophical discourse freedom is discussed in the context of \\n free will \\n and self-determination balanced by \\n moral responsibility \\n Advocates of free will regard freedom of thought as innate to the human mind while opponents regard the mind as thinking only the thoughts that a purely deterministic brain happens to be engaged in at the time \\n Social freedom or liberty \\n Four Freedoms \\n a series of paintings meant to describe the freedoms for which allied nations fought in World War II \\n Main articles \\n Political freedom \\n and \\n Liberty \\n In political discourse \\n political freedom \\n is often associated with \\n liberty \\n and \\n autonomy \\n in the sense of \"giving oneself one\\'s own laws\" and with having \\n rights \\n and the \\n civil liberties \\n with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include \\n freedom of assembly \\n freedom of association \\n freedom of choice \\n and \\n freedom of speech \\n In some circumstances particularly when discussion is limited to political freedoms the terms \"freedom\" and \"liberty\" tend to be used interchangeably \\n Elsewhere however subtle distinctions between freedom and liberty have been noted \\n JohnStuartMill \\n differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily if not exclusively the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved As such the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others \\n Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains the differences in terms of their relation to institutions \\n Liberty is linked to human subjectivity freedom is not The Declaration of Independence for example describes men as having liberty and the nation as being free Free will \\n the quality of being free from the control of fate or necessity \\n may first have been attributed to human will but \\n Newtonian physics \\n attributes freedom \\n degrees of freedom \\n free bodies \\n to objects \\n Freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline Liberty like discipline is linked to institutions and political parties whether liberal or libertarian freedom is not Although freedom can work for or against institutions it is not bound to themit travels through unofficial networks To have liberty is to be liberated from something to be free is to be self-determining autonomous Freedom can or cannot exist within a state of liberty one can be liberated yet \\n unfree \\n or \\n free \\n yet enslaved Orlando Patterson has argued in \\n Freedom Freedom in the Making of Western Culture \\n that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves \\n Another distinction that some political theorists have deemed important is that people may aspire to have freedom \\n from \\n limiting forces such as \\n freedom from fear \\n freedom from want \\n and \\n freedom from discrimination \\n but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty \\n from \\n anything \\n To the contrary the concept of \\n negative liberty \\n refers to the liberty one person may have to restrict the rights of others \\n Other important fields in which freedom is an issue include \\n economic freedom \\n academic freedom \\n intellectual freedom \\n and \\n scientific freedom \\n Freedom as a physical concept \\n In purely physical terms freedom is used much more broadly to describe the limits to which physical movement or other physical processes are possible This relates to the philosophical concept to the extent that people may be considered to have as much freedom as they are physically able to exercise The number of independent \\n variables \\n or parameters for a system is described as its number of \\n degrees of freedom \\n For example the movement of a vehicle along a road has two degrees of freedom to go fast or slow or to change direction by turning left or right The movement of a ship sailing on the waves has four degrees of freedom since it can also pitch nose-to-tail and roll side-to-side An aeroplane can also climb and sideslip giving it \\n six degrees of freedom \\n Degrees of freedom in mechanics \\n describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or in case of a \\n mechanism \\n made of several bodies the number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism In the study of complex \\n motor control \\n there may be so many degrees of freedom that a given action can be achieved in different ways by combining movements with different degrees of freedom This issue is sometimes called the \\n degrees of freedom problem \\n Freedom in mathematical theory \\n In \\n mathematics \\n freedom is the ability of a \\n variable \\n to change in value \\n Some equations have many such variables This notion is formalized as the \\n dimension \\n of a \\n manifold \\n or an \\n algebraic variety \\n When \\n degrees of freedom \\n is used instead of \\n dimension \\n this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined Such degrees of freedom appear in many mathematical and related disciplines including \\n degrees of freedom \\n as used in \\n physics \\n and \\n chemistry \\n to explain dependence on \\n parameters \\n or the \\n dimensions \\n of a \\n phase space \\n and \\n degrees of freedom in statistics \\n the number of values in the final calculation of a \\n statistic \\n that are free to vary Creativity \\n For other uses see \\n Creativity disambiguation \\n A picture of a lightbulb is associated to

scientific theory \\n a \\n musical composition \\n or a \\n joke \\n or a physical object such as an \\n invention \\n a \\n literary work \\n or a \\n painting \\n Scholarly interest in creativity

\"something original and worthwhile\" \\n Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature \\n As an illustration one definition given by \\n Dr E Paul Torrance \\n described it as \"a process of becoming sensitive to problems deficiencies gaps in knowledge missing elements disharmonies and so on identifying the difficulty searching for solutions making guesses or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them and finally communicating the results \" \\n Aspects \\n Theories of creativity particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others have focused on a variety of aspects The dominant factors are usually identified as \"the four Ps\" process product person and place according to \\n Mel Rhodes \\n A focus on \\n process \\n is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking such as \\n Guilford \\n or those describing the staging of the creative process such as \\n Wallas \\n are primarily theories of creative process A focus on creative \\n product \\n usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics see below and in creative ideas framed as successful \\n memes \\n The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more \\n A focus on the nature of the creative \\n person \\n considers more general intellectual habits such as openness levels of \\n ideation \\n autonomy expertise exploratory behavior and so on A focus on \\n place \\n considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes such as degrees of autonomy access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility \\n Etymology \\n The \\n lexeme \\n in the English word \\n creativity \\n comes from the \\n Latin \\n term \\n cre \\n \"to create make\" its \\n derivational suffixes \\n also come from Latin The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century notably in Chaucer to indicate divine creation \\n in \\n The Parson\\'s Tale \\n However its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after \\n the Enlightenment \\n History of the concept \\n History of the concept of creativity \\n Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity preferring to see art as a form of discovery Asked in \\n The Republic \\n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" Plato answers \"Certainly not he merely \\n imitates \\n \" \\n Ancient views \\n Most ancient cultures including thinkers of \\n Ancient Greece \\n Ancient China \\n and \\n Ancient India \\n lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation The \\n ancient Greeks \\n had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \" \\n poiein \\n \" \"to make\" which only applied to \\n poiesis \\n poetry and to the \\n poietes \\n poet or \"maker\" who made it \\n Plato \\n did not believe in art as a form of creation Asked in \\n The Republic \\n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" he answers \"Certainly not he merely \\n imitates \\n \" \\n It is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in \\n Western culture \\n through \\n Christianity \\n as a matter of \\n divine inspiration \\n According to the historian \\n Daniel J Boorstin \\n \"the early Western conception of creativity was the \\n Biblical story of creation \\n given in the \\n Genesis \\n \" \\n However this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the \\n Renaissance \\n In the Judaeo-Christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God\\'s work \\n A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance \\n Muses \\n were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods \\n Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \" \\n daemon \\n \" Greek or \" \\n genius \\n \" Latin linked to the sacred or the divine However none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the \\n Renaissance \\n It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of \" \\n great men \\n \" \\n The Enlightenment and after \\n The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the \\n Renaissance \\n and even later \\n The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the \\n Renaissance \\n when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named \\n humanism \\n which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual \\n From this philosophy arose the \\n Renaissance man \\n or polymath an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation \\n One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is \\n Leonardo da Vinci \\n However this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment \\n By the 18th century and the \\n Age of Enlightenment \\n mention of creativity notably in \\n aesthetics \\n linked with the concept of \\n imagination \\n became more frequent \\n In the writing of \\n Thomas Hobbes \\n imagination became a key element of human cognition \\n William Duff \\n was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of \\n genius \\n typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius \\n As a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century \\n Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of \\n Darwinism \\n In particular they refer to the work of \\n Francis Galton \\n who through his \\n eugenicist \\n outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius \\n In the late 19th and early 20th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as \\n Hermann von Helmholtz \\n and \\n Henri Poincar \\n began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes \\n Twentieth century to the present day \\n The insights of Poincar and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as \\n Graham Wallas \\n and \\n Max Wertheimer \\n In his work \\n Art of Thought \\n published in Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process In the Wallas stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of stages \\n i \\n preparation \\n preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual\\'s mind on the problem and explores the problem\\'s dimensions \\n ii \\n incubation \\n where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening \\n iii \\n intimation \\n the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way \\n iv \\n illumination \\n or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its \\n preconscious \\n processing into conscious awareness \\n v \\n verification \\n where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied \\n Wallas\\' model is often treated as four stages with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage \\n Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the \\n evolutionary \\n process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments Simonton \\n provides an updated perspective on this view in his book \\n Origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity \\n In \\n Alfred North Whitehead \\n gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as \\n Process and Reality \\n He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme \"Whitehead actually coined the term our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that its invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded\" \\n The formal \\n psychometric \\n measurement of creativity from the standpoint of orthodox \\n psychological \\n literature is usually considered to have begun with \\n J P Guilford \\n \\'s address to the \\n American Psychological Association \\n which helped popularize the topic \\n and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as with the work of H L Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination \\n but it did not have the same impact Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to \\n IQ \\n -type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed Guilford\\'s work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down \\n \"Four C\" model \\n James C Kaufman \\n and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity \\n mini-c \\n \"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights\" \\n little-c \\n everyday problem solving and creative expression \\n Pro-C \\n exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and \\n Big-C \\n creativity considered great in the given field This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity It also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals \\n The contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used Kozbelt Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity \\n Margaret Boden \\n distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal \\n Robinson \\n and Anna Craft \\n have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity \\n and cites \\n Ken Robinson \\n as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity \\n Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi \\n has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain-changing contributions Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity \\n Theories of creative processes \\n There has been much empirical study in \\n psychology \\n and \\n cognitive science \\n of the processes through which creativity occurs Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity \\n Incubation \\n Incubation is a temporary break from \\n creative problem solving \\n that can result in insight \\n There has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas\\' model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving Ward \\n lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some \\n empirical evidence \\n is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become \\n fixated \\n on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem \\n This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks \\n This earlier hypothesis is discussed in \\n Csikszentmihalyi \\n \\'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem \\n Convergent and divergent thinking \\n J P Guilford \\n drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed \\n convergent \\n and \\n divergent thinking \\n Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature Other researchers have occasionally used the terms \\n flexible \\n thinking or \\n fluid intelligence \\n which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity \\n citation needed \\n Creative cognition approach \\n In Finke et al proposed the \"Geneplore\" model in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts \\n Weisberg \\n argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results \\n The ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory \\n Helie and Sun \\n recently proposed a unified framework for understanding \\n creativity in problem solving \\n namely the ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory of creativity This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of \\n incubation \\n and \\n insight \\n The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely \\n The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge \\n The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks \\n The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge \\n The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing \\n The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing \\n A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the \\n CLARION cognitive architecture \\n and used to simulate relevant human data This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena \\n Conceptual blending \\n Conceptual blending \\n In \\n The Act of Creation \\n Arthur Koestler \\n introduced the concept of \\n bisociation \\n that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference \\n This idea was later developed into conceptual blending In the 1990s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with \\n metaphor \\n analogy \\n and \\n structure mapping \\n have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label \\n conceptual blending \\n Honing theory \\n Honing theory developed principally by psychologist \\n Liane Gabora \\n posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self-mending nature of a worldview The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process When faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the worldview changes through interaction with the task This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only is the task conceived of differently but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge \\n A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state \\n Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task Thus the creative idea may feel half-baked It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with \\n Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or \\'voice\\' even through in different creative outlets This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creator\\'s uniquely structured worldview Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization However research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing \\n Everyday imaginative thought \\n In everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only \" \\n Their \\n counterfactual thinking \\n is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes \\n It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought \\n Assessing individual creative ability \\n Creativity quotient \\n Several attempts have been made to develop a \\n creativity quotient \\n of an individual similar to the \\n intelligence quotient \\n IQ however these have been unsuccessful \\n Psychometric approach \\n J P Guilford \\n \\'s group \\n which pioneered the modern \\n psychometric \\n study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in \\n Plot Titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles \\n Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness \\n Figure Concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommonness \\n Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks \\n Remote Associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e g Hand Call \\n Remote Consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e g loss of gravity \\n Building on Guilford\\'s work \\n Torrance \\n developed the \\n Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \\n in \\n They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on \\n Fluency \\n The total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus \\n Originality \\n The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects \\n Elaboration \\n The amount of detail in the responses \\n The \\n Creativity Achievement Questionnaire \\n a self-report test that measures creative achievement across domains was described in and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output \\n Such tests sometimes called \\n Divergent Thinking DT \\n tests have been both supported \\n and criticized \\n Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of \\n divergent thinking \\n tests using semantic approach When compared to human raters \\n NLP \\n techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality when compared to human raters \\n The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of and respectively to human graders \\n Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures \\n Most recently an NSF-funded \\n team of researchers led by \\n James C Kaufman \\n and Mark A Runco \\n combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system This system enabled automated scoring of \\n DT \\n tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of \\n DT \\n tests that had been found and reported \\n The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of to human graders \\n Social-personality approach \\n Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity In these studies personality traits such as independence of judgement self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals \\n A \\n meta-analysis \\n by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self-accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive \" Openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed \\n Within the framework of the \\n Big Five \\n model of personality some consistent traits have emerged \\n Openness to experience \\n has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity \\n Among the other Big Five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity Compared to non-artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience \\n conscientious \\n and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists \\n Creativity and intelligence \\n The potential relationship between creativity and \\n intelligence \\n has been of interest since the late 1900s when a multitude of influential studies from Getzels & Jackson \\n Barron \\n Wallach & Kogan \\n and Guilford \\n focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why \\n There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the main theories as follows \\n Threshold Theory Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120 \\n Certification Theory Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence Instead individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence \\n Interference Theory Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability \\n Sternberg and OHara \\n proposed a framework of possible relationships between creativity and intelligence \\n Creativity is a subset of intelligence \\n Intelligence is a subset of creativity \\n Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs \\n Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets \\n Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets \\n Creativity as a subset of intelligence \\n A number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence \\n Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence \\n Gardners \\n Theory of multiple intelligences \\n MIT \\n implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT To demonstrate this Gardner cited examples of different famous creators each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e g Picasso spatial intelligence Freud intrapersonal Einstein logical-mathematical and Gandhi interpersonal \\n Sternbergs Theory of Successful intelligence \\n see \\n Triarchic theory of intelligence \\n includes creativity as a main component and comprises sub-theories Componential Analytic Contextual Practical and Experiential Creative Experiential sub-theory the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems is directly related to creativity \\n The \\n CattellHornCarroll theory \\n includes creativity as a subset of intelligence Specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include \\n ideational fluency associational fluency and originality/creativity Silvia et al \\n conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor Martindale \\n extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased \\n The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence \\n posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence Type is a conscious process and concerns goal directed thoughts which are explained by \\n g \\n Type is an unconscious process and concerns spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type and Type processes working together in combination The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees \\n Intelligence as a subset of creativity \\n In this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity \\n Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity \\n Sternberg & Lubarts Investment Theory \\n Using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors they buy low and sell high in their ideas Like under/low-valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people The creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value After convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people and moves onto generating another idea According to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence knowledge thinking styles personality motivation and environment Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts \\n Amabiles Componential Model of Creativity \\n In this model there are within-individual components needed for creativity domain-relevant skills creativity-relevant processes and task motivation and component external to the individual their surrounding social environment Creativity requires a confluence of all components High creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment \\n Amusement Park Theoretical Model \\n In this 4-step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role \\n To get into the amusement park there are initial requirements e g time/transport to go to the park Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity They are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour \\n Secondly are the subcomponents general thematic areas that increase in specificity Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e g a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e g poetry \\n Thirdly there are specific domains After choosing the type of park to visit e g waterpark you then have to choose which specific park to go to Within the poetry domain there are many different types e g free verse riddles sonnet etc that have to be selected from \\n Lastly there are micro-domains These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e g individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark \\n Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs \\n This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs \\n Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs \\n Renzullis Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness \\n In this conceptualisation giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment Under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions \\n PASS theory of intelligence \\n In this theory the planning component relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity \\n Threshold Theory TT A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120 Above this threshold of an IQ of if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak \\n TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity \\n In support of the TT Barron \\n reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample Yamamoto \\n in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of \\n r \\n = and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children Fuchs-Beauchamp et al \\n in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from \\n r \\n = to \\n r \\n = in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold the correlations were \\n r \\n = < Cho et al \\n reported a correlation of between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults and a correlation of close to \\n r \\n = for the high IQ group Jauk et al \\n found support for the TT but only for measures of creative potential not creative performance \\n Much modern day research reports findings against TT Wai et al \\n in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood found that differences in SAT scores at age were predictive of creative real-life outcomes years later Kims \\n meta-analysis of studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQ\\'s of Preckel et al \\n investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of \\n r \\n = to \\n r \\n = across all levels of cognitive ability \\n Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets \\n Under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity Thus creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing Perkins \\n referred to this as the nothing-special view \\n Weisberg & Alba \\n examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem see \\n Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle \\n where the participants are asked to connect all dots in the rows of dots using straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required \\n Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets \\n In this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs \\n Getzels and Jackson \\n administered creativity measures to a group of children from grades 6-12 and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was \\n r \\n = The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers The high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20% for IQ but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated \\n However this work has been heavily criticised Wallach and Kogan \\n highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills McNemar \\n noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from different IQ tests \\n Wallach and Kogan \\n administered measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and measures of general intelligence to 5th grade children These tests were untimed and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average \\n r \\n = Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average \\n r \\n = with each other Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated \\n r \\n = \\n Neuroscience \\n The \\n neuroscience \\n of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour It has been addressed \\n in the article \"Creative Innovation Possible Brain Mechanisms \" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected \" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways \\n they have a high level of specialized knowledge \\n they are capable of \\n divergent thinking \\n mediated by the \\n frontal lobe \\n and they are able to modulate \\n neurotransmitters \\n such as \\n norepinephrine \\n in their frontal lobe \\n Thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the \\n cortex \\n that is most important for creativity \\n This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep \\n mood \\n and \\n addiction disorders \\n and \\n depression \\n In Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive Drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the \\n temporal lobes \\n and \\n dopamine \\n from the \\n limbic system \\n The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa High dopamine levels increase general \\n arousal \\n and goal directed behaviors and reduce \\n latent inhibition \\n and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas \\n A study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other \\n default mode network \\n functions \\n Working memory and the cerebellum \\n Vandervert \\n described how the brain\\'s frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the \\n cerebellum \\n collaborate to produce creativity and innovation Vandervert\\'s explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of \\n working memory \\n responsible for processing all thought \\n are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum \\n The cerebellum consisting of billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain \\n is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency The cerebellum\\'s adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes \\n where creative and innovative thoughts arise \\n Apparently creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe \\n According to Vandervert the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC \\n New hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion \\n Vandervert\\'s approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the \\n child prodigy \\n and thought in general \\n Essentially Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem \\n Most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans \\n Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimizes efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology \\n Prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself Further Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the \\n Khan Academy \\n The model proposed by Vandervert has however received incisive critique from several authors \\n REM sleep \\n Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement Sleep aids this process \\n REM \\n rather than \\n NREM sleep \\n appears to be responsible \\n This has been suggested to be due to changes in \\n cholinergic \\n and \\n noradrenergic \\n neuromodulation \\n that occurs during REM sleep \\n During this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the \\n hippocampus \\n suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the \\n neocortex \\n and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus \\n This is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes \" \\n Affect \\n Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence As noted in \\n voting behavior \\n the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making \\n Positive affect relations \\n According to \\n Alice Isen \\n positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity \\n Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association \\n Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem \\n Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated Together these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity \\n Barbara Fredrickson \\n in her \\n broaden-and-build \\n model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person\\'s available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity \\n According to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope \\n Various meta-analyses such as Baas et al of studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect \\n Creativity and artificial intelligence \\n Jrgen Schmidhuber \\n \\'s formal \\n theory \\n of creativity \\n postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple \\n computational \\n principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own \\n sensory \\n inputs The agent can use a \\n black box \\n optimization method such as \\n reinforcement learning \\n to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future \\n reward \\n signals There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry But Schmidhuber\\'s \\n objective function \\n to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects \" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals A wow-effect is formally defined as follows As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an \\n artificial neural network \\n or some other \\n machine learning \\n device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time The improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning This difference depends on the encoder\\'s present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in \\n data compression \\n or computational speed It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects Irregular random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress and thus are \"boring\" by nature providing no reward Already known and predictable regularities also are boring Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations This motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration \\n According to Schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and \\n comedians \\n

Creativity and mental illness \\n A study by psychologist \\n J Philippe Rushton \\n found creativity to correlate with \\n intelligence \\n and \\n psychoticism \\n Another study found creativity to be greater in \\n schizotypal \\n than in either normal or \\n schizophrenic \\n individuals While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the \\n prefrontal cortex \\n schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their \\n right \\n prefrontal cortex \\n This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate In agreement with this hypothesis \\n ambidexterity \\n is also associated with \\n schizotypal \\n and \\n schizophrenic \\n individuals Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal \\n and hypomanic personality \\n and several different measures of creativity \\n Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and \\n mood disorders \\n particularly \\n manic-depressive disorder \\n a k a \\n bipolar disorder \\n and \\n depressive disorder \\n a k a \\n unipolar disorder \\n In \\n Touched with Fire Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament \\n Kay Redfield Jamison \\n summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in \\n writers \\n poets \\n and \\n artists \\n She also explores research that identifies \\n mood disorders \\n in such famous writers and artists as \\n Ernest Hemingway \\n who shot himself after \\n electroconvulsive treatment \\n Virginia Woolf \\n who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer \\n Robert Schumann \\n who died in a mental institution and even the famed \\n visual artist \\n Michelangelo \\n A study looking at persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder There was no overall overrepresentation but overrepresentation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives \\n Another study involving more than one million people conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder \\n However as a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports \\n According to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress \\n Creativity and personality \\n Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth innovation speed etc These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals \\n i \\n Incubate \\n Long-term Development \\n ii \\n Imagine \\n Breakthrough Ideas \\n iii \\n Improve \\n Incremental Adjustments \\n iv \\n Invest \\n Short-term Goals \\n Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at \\n Manchester Business School \\n has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each \\n i \"Idea Generation\" Fluency Originality Incubation and Illumination \\n ii \"Personality\" Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity \\n iii \"Motivation\" Intrinsic Extrinsic and Achievement \\n iv \"Confidence\" Producing Sharing and Implementing \\n This model was developed in a sample of working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling \\n An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterised by the \\n psychometric \\n approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference \\n One characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called \\n divergent production \\n Divergent production \\n is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation \\n One way of measuring \\n divergent production \\n is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \\n The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions \\n Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways In a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects \\n The aspect of motivation within a person\\'s personality may predict creativity levels in the person Motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people \\n From a personality-traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people \\n Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self-accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity \\n From an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas As ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments As a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society \\n In studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found Creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non-nurturing Most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination \\n Another theory of creative people is the \\n investment theory of creativity \\n This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity In the \\n investment \\n sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea Just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected This \\n investment theory of creativity \\n views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way \\n Malevolent creativity \\n Malevolent creativity MC focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity \\n This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism However MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal \\n Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving The personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC \\n Harris and Reiter-Palmon\\'s research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions They concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individuals expression of malevolent creativity \\n The current measure for malevolent creativity is the item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale MCBS \\n Malevolent creativity and crime \\n Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime As creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime \\n Creativity across cultures \\n Creativity is viewed differently in different countries \\n For example cross-cultural research centred on \\n Hong Kong \\n found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e g what they can contribute to society \\n Mpofu et al surveyed African languages and found that had no word which directly translated to \\'creativity\\' the exception being \\n Arabic \\n The principle of \\n linguistic relativity \\n i e that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for \\'creativity\\' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages However more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative \\n Africa \\n has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as \\n music \\n art \\n and \\n storytelling \\n Nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa \\n and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America \\n Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity For example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life\\'s challenges \\n while in Germany creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems \\n In organizations \\n Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in \\n Brazil \\n The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity \\n It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent For any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands Thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes \\n Amabile \\n argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed \\n Expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledge \\n Creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems \\n and Motivation especially \\n intrinsic motivation \\n There are two types of motivation \\n extrinsic motivation \\n external \\n factors for example \\n threats \\n of being fired or money as a reward \\n intrinsic motivation \\n comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc \\n Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are \\n Challenge matching people with the right assignments \\n Freedom giving people \\n autonomy \\n choosing means to achieve goals \\n Resources \\n such as time money space etc There must be balance fit among resources and people \\n Work group features \\n diverse \\n supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each other\\'s talents \\n Supervisory \\n encouragement recognitions cheering praising \\n Organizational support value emphasis information sharing \\n collaboration \\n Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations \\n In particular he emphasized the role that \\n tacit knowledge \\n has to play in the creative process \\n In business \\n originality \\n is not enough The idea must also be appropriateuseful and \\n actionable \\n Creative competitive intelligence \\n is a new solution to solve this problem According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to \\n innovation \\n process and \\n competitive intelligence \\n to creative workers \\n Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace It is essential for innovation and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses In the sociologist Silvia Leal Martn using the Innova 3DX method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear \\n Similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation \\n The investigation by Loo \\n on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page It offers connections with the sections on the Four C model Theories of creative processes Creativity as a subset of intelligence Creativity and personality and In organisations It is the last section that the investigation addresses \\n Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels macro meso and micro Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension Meso studies focus on organisations Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses e g Burton-Jones Drucker economics e g Cortada Reich Florida education e g Farrell and Fenwick Brown Lauder and Ashton human resource management e g Davenport knowledge and organizational management Alvesson Defillippi Arthur and Lindsay Orr Nutley Russell Bain Hacking and Moran sociology psychology and knowledge economy-related sectors especially information technology IT software e g ORiain Nerland and advertising e g Grabher Lury Loo \\n Loo studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives Specifically the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising and systems software developing and software programme managing \\n The study offers a conceptual framework Loo p of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles and single and multi-contexts The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics e g Reich Quah management e g Drucker Nonaka and Takeuchi von Hippel sociology e g Zuboff Bell Lash and Urry Castells Knorr Cetina and psychology e g Gardner Csikszentmihalyi Sternberg Kaufman and Pretz The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work These workers apply their cognitive abilities creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science technology or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities e g a medium product or service These work activities may be done individually or collectively Education training and encultured environments are necessary for the performance of these creative activities Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner and creating something that is different and novel i e a variation on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives \\n This investigation identifies a definition of creative work three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination problem-solving problem seeking and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example for a creative director in the advertising industry it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector In addition to the creative applications creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles Passion for ones job is generic For copywriters this passion is identified with fun enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product confidence and patience in finding the appropriate copy Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities e g literature the creative arts e g painting and music and technical-related know-how e g mathematics computer sciences and physical sciences In the IT software technical knowledge of computer languages e g C+++ is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers \\n There are three types of work One is intra-sectoral e g general sponge and in tune with the zeitgeist advertising and power of expression and sensitivity IT software The second is inter-sectoral e g integration of advertising activities advertising and autonomous decentralized systems ADS IT software The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors e g three-dimensional trust and green credentials advertising and collaboration with HEIs and industry and ADS system in the Tokyo train operator IT software \\n The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information communications and electronic technologies ICET infrastructure training work environment and education \\n This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure delivery approaches and assessments At a macro level governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally and foster an environment which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation \\n Team Composition \\n Diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways However under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives \\n Thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity \\n Team Processes \\n Team communication \\n norms \\n such as respecting others expertise paying attention to others ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements \\n negotiating \\n remaining open to others ideas learning from others and building on each others ideas increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with \\n brainstorming \\n and \\n problem solving \\n Through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team \\n affect \\n which facilitates collective creativity \\n Organizational Culture \\n Supportive and motivational environments that create \\n psychological safety \\n by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well \\n Organizations in which \\n help-seeking \\n help giving \\n and \\n collaboration \\n are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur \\n Additionally \\n leadership styles \\n that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity \\n Economic views of creativity \\n Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modelling markets for creativity and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation \\n In the early 20th century \\n Joseph Schumpeter \\n introduced the economic theory of \\n creative destruction \\n to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new Some economists such as \\n Paul Romer \\n view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth Creativity leads to \\n capital \\n and creative products are protected by \\n intellectual property \\n laws \\n Mark A Runco \\n and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \" \\n psychoeconomic \\n \" model of creativity \\n In such a model creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive \\n utility \\n and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations \\n The \\n creative class \\n is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies In his book \\n The Rise of the Creative Class \\n economist \\n Richard Florida \\n popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T\\'s of economic development Technology Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of \\n creative professionals \\n and tend to have a higher level of economic development \\n Fostering creativity \\n Creativity techniques \\n Daniel Pink in his book \\n A Whole New Mind \\n repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important In this \\n conceptual age \\n we will need to foster and encourage \\n right-directed thinking \\n representing creativity and emotion over \\n left-directed thinking \\n representing logical analytical thought However this simplification of \\'right\\' versus \\'left\\' brain thinking is not supported by the research data \\n Nickerson \\n provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry \\n Establishing purpose and intention \\n Building basic skills \\n Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge \\n Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration \\n Building motivation especially internal motivation \\n Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks \\n Focusing on mastery and self-competition \\n Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity \\n Providing opportunities for choice and discovery \\n Developing self-management metacognitive skills \\n Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance \\n Providing balance \\n Some see the conventional system of \\n schooling \\n as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt particularly in the \\n preschool \\n / \\n kindergarten \\n and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly rich imagination-fostering environment for young children \\n Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise \\n In addition to helping with problem solving creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so \\n See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought \\n Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake \\n To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks \\n Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it \\n Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual Such ideas range from the \\n psychological \\n -cognitive such as \\n Osborn \\n - \\n Parnes \\n Creative Problem Solving Process \\n Synectics \\n science-based creative thinking Purdue Creative Thinking Program and \\n Edward de Bono \\n \\'s \\n lateral thinking \\n to the highly structured such as \\n TRIZ \\n the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist \\n Genrich Altshuller \\n and Computer-Aided \\n morphological analysis \\n Creativity has also been identified as one of the key \\n 21st century skills \\n and as one of the \\n Four Cs of 21st century learning \\n by educational leaders and theorists in the United States \\n List of academic journals addressing creativity \\n Creativity Research Journal \\n Creativity
