founders of the world religions in a process of \\n progressive revelation \\n As a result the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose In this view there is unity among the founders of world religions but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic \\n Within this universal view the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bah\\' Faith \\n The \\n Bah\\' teachings \\n state that since all humans have been created in the image of God God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race colour or religion \\n Thus because all humans have been created equal they all require equal opportunities and treatment \\n Thus the Bah\\' view promotes the unity of humanity and that people\\'s vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation \\n The teaching however does not equal unity with uniformity but instead the Bah\\' writings advocate for the principle of \\n unity in diversity \\n where the variety in the human race is valued \\n Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards and the inevitability of \\n world peace \\n Christianity \\n Christian Universalism \\n The fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is \\n universal reconciliation \\n that all humans will eventually be saved and eventually enter Heaven in God\\'s kingdom through the grace and work of \\n Jesus Christ \\n Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal \\n Hell \\n does not exist and was not what Jesus taught They point to historical evidence which shows that some of the early \\n church fathers \\n were universalists and attribute the beginning of the idea of hell as eternal to mistranslation \\n and as a later creation of the \\n Catholic Church \\n Universalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings \\n They also argue that an eternal hell is both unjust and against the nature and attributes of a loving God \\n The remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are compatible with Christianity in general \\n citation needed \\n God \\n is the loving Parent of all people see \\n Love of God \\n Jesus Christ \\n reveals the nature and character of God and is the spiritual leader of humankind see \\n New Covenant \\n Humankind is created with an \\n immortal soul \\n which death does not endor a \\n mortal soul \\n that

God\\'s punishments for sin are corrective and remedial and none of them will last forever or result in the permanent destruction of a soul Some Christian Universalists believe in the idea of Purgatorial Hell a temporary place of purification \\n that some must undergo before the inevitable entrance of all into Heaven \\n In the Universalist General Convention later called the \\n Universalist Church of America \\n adopted the Five Principles the belief in God Jesus Christ the immortality of the human soul the reality of sin and \\n universal reconciliation \\n History of Universal Reconciliation \\n Universalist writers such as \\n George T Knight \\n have claimed that Universalism was a widely held view among theologians in \\n Early Christianity \\n including important figures such as \\n Origen \\n and \\n Clement of Alexandria \\n Origen and Clement both taught the existence of a non-eternal Hell Hell was remedial in that it was a place one went to purge

its origins in Christianity UU is no longer a Christian church As of fewer than about 20% of Unitarian Universalists identified themselves as Christian \\n Contemporary Unitarian Universalism espouses a pluralist approach to religious belief whereby members may describe themselves as \\n humanist \\n agnostic \\n deist \\n atheist \\n pagan Christian \\n monotheist \\n pantheist \\n polytheist \\n

thought \\n Hinduism \\n Author David Frawley says that Hinduism has a \"background universalism\" and its teachings contain a \"universal relevance \" \\n Hinduism \\n is also naturally \\n religiously pluralistic \\n A well-known \\n Rig Vedic \\n hymn says \"Truth is One though the sages know it variously \" \\n Similarly in the \\n Bhagavad Gt \\n God manifesting as an incarnation states \"As people approach me so I receive them All paths lead to me \" \\n The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God whether one knows it or not \\n While Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions it also has a wide range of diversity within it \\n There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology \\n as well as multiple unorthodox or \"hetrodox\" traditions called \\n darshanas \\n Hindu Universalism \\n Main articles \\n Neo-Vedanta \\n and \\n Hindu reform movements \\n Hindu Universalism \\n also called \\n Neo-Vedanta \\n and \\n neo-Hinduism \\n is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and \\n orientalism \\n It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect \\n It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a \"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\" \\n with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine \\n For example it presents that \\n an imagined \"integral unity\" that was probably little more than an \"imagined\" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality \"on the ground \" as it were throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region \\n Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity \\n self-published source \\n This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture \\n extending far beyond the \\n Dashanami Sampradaya \\n the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by \\n Adi Shankara \\n An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was \\n Ram Mohan Roy \\n who established the \\n Brahmo Samaj \\n Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by \\n Vivekananda \\n and \\n Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan \\n Veneration for all other religions was articulated by \\n Gandhi \\n After long study and experience I have come to the conclusion that all religions are true all religions have some error in them all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one\\'s own close relatives My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith therefore no thought of conversion is possible \\n Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation regarding Vedanta to be the \"central theology of Hinduism\" \\n Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a \"single world religion\" \\n and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as \\'distortions\\' of the basic teachings of Vedanta \\n citation

\\n pageneeded \\n Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians and Sabians whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve let there be no compulsion in religion \\n However the most exclusive teachings opinion differently For example the \\n Salafi \\n refer to Surah \\n citation needed \\n Then when the sacred months have passed slay the idolaters \\n mushrikun \\n wherever ye find them and take them and besiege them and lay in wait in every stratagem of war But if they repent and establish worship and pay the \\n Zakat \\n then leave their way free Lo! Allah is Forgiving Merciful Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture i e people of the book as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger and follow not the Religion of Truth until they pay the \\n jizya \\n readily being brought low in submission \\n The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought traditionalist and reform-minded and branches of Islam from the reforming \\n Quranism \\n and \\n Ahmadiyya \\n to the ultra-traditionalist \\n Salafi \\n as is the doctrine of abrogation \\n naskh \\n which is used to determine which verses take precedence based on reconstructed chronology with later verses superseding earlier ones The traditional chronology places Surah as the last or second-to-last surah revealed thus in traditional exegesis it gains a large power of abrogation and verses are held to have abrogated \\n The ahadith also play a major role in this and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections generally along with the \\n Muwatta Imam Malik \\n Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely from the Qur\\'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith to the Salafi or \\n ahl al-hadith \\n who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence \\n Traditional Islam \\n views the world as bipartite consisting of the House of Islam that is where people live under the \\n Islamic law \\n and the House of War that is where the people do not live under Islamic law which must be proselytized \\n using whatever resources available including in some traditionalist and conservative interpretations \\n the use of violence as holy struggle in the path of Allah \\n to either convert its inhabitants to Islam or to rule them under the Shariah cf \\n dhimmi \\n Judaism \\n Jewish views on religious pluralism \\n Noahidism \\n Judaism teaches that God \\n chose the Jewish people \\n to be in a unique covenant with God and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the \\n Torah \\n with a specific missionto be a light unto the nations and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoplesrather Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as \\n Noachides \\n and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind \\n An on-line organization the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by \\n Steven Blane \\n who calls himself an \"American Jewish Universalist Rabbi\" believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism stating that \"God equally chose all nations to be lights unto the world and we have much to learn and share with each other We can only accomplish \\n Tikkun Olam \\n by our unconditional acceptance of each other\\'s peaceful doctrines \" \\n Manichaeism \\n Manichaeism \\n Manichaeism like Christian \\n Gnosticism \\n and \\n Zurvanism \\n was inherently universalist \\n

This is the \\n latest accepted revision \\n reviewed \\n on \\n March \\n For the early-20th-century periodical see \\n Social Justice periodical \\n College students live in tents for a week to call attention to perceived social injustice \\n Social justice \\n is a concept of \\n fair \\n and \\n just \\n relations between the \\n individual \\n and \\n society \\n This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the \\n distribution of wealth \\n opportunities for personal activity and \\n social privileges \\n In \\n Western \\n as well as in older \\n Asian cultures \\n the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their \\n societal roles \\n and receive what was their due from society \\n In the current global \\n grassroots \\n movements for social justice the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for \\n social mobility \\n the creation of \\n safety nets \\n and \\n economic justice \\n Social justice assigns rights and duties in the \\n institutions \\n of society which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation The relevant institutions often include \\n taxation \\n social insurance \\n public health \\n public school \\n public services \\n labour law \\n and \\n regulation \\n of \\n markets \\n to ensure \\n fair \\n distribution of wealth \\n and \\n equal opportunity \\n Interpretations that relate justice to a \\n reciprocal relationship \\n to society are mediated by differences in cultural traditions some of which emphasize the individual responsibility toward society and others the equilibrium between access to power and its responsible use \\n Hence social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures such as \\n Bartolom de las Casas \\n in philosophical debates about differences among human beings in efforts for gender racial and \\n social equality \\n for advocating justice for \\n migrants \\n prisoners the \\n environment \\n and the physically and developmentally \\n disabled \\n While the concept of social justice can be traced through the theology of \\n Augustine of Hippo \\n and the philosophy of \\n Thomas Paine \\n the term \"social justice\" became used explicitly from the 1840s A \\n Jesuit \\n priest named \\n Luigi Taparelli \\n is typically credited with coining the term and it spread during the \\n revolutions of \\n with the work of \\n Antonio Rosmini-Serbati \\n In the late industrial revolution \\n progressive \\n American legal scholars began to use the term more particularly \\n Louis Brandeis \\n and \\n Roscoe Pound \\n From the early 20th century it was also embedded in \\n international law \\n and institutions the preamble to establish the \\n International Labour Organization \\n recalled that \"universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice \" In the later 20th century social justice was made central to the philosophy of the \\n social contract \\n primarily by \\n John Rawls \\n in \\n A Theory of Justice \\n In the \\n Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \\n treats social justice as a purpose of \\n human rights education \\n Contemporary theory \\n Philosophical perspectives \\n Cosmic values \\n John Rawls \\n Thomas Pogge \\n United Nations \\n Religious perspectives \\n Hinduism \\n Islam \\n Judaism \\n Christianity \\n Methodism \\n Catholicism \\n Criticism \\n Social justice movements \\n Liberation theology \\n Health care \\n Human rights education \\n Notes \\n Articles \\n Books \\n Main articles \\n Social contract \\n Justice \\n Corrective justice \\n and \\n Distributive justice \\n The different concepts of \\n justice \\n as discussed in ancient \\n Western philosophy \\n were typically centered upon the community \\n Plato \\n Plato \\n wrote in \\n The Republic \\n that it would be an ideal state that \"every member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted \" \\n In an article for J N V University author D R Bhandari says \"Justice is for Plato at once a part of human virtue and the bond which joins man together in society It is the identical quality that makes good and social Justice is an order and duty of the parts of the soul it is to the soul as health is to the body Plato says that justice is not mere strength but it is a harmonious strength Justice is not the right of the stronger but the effective harmony of the whole All moral conceptions revolve about the good of the whole-individual as well as social\" \\n Aristotle \\n Aristotle \\n believed rights existed only between free people and the law should take \"account in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality \" Reflecting this time when \\n slavery \\n and subjugation of women was typical ancient views of justice tended to reflect the rigid class systems that still prevailed On the other hand for the privileged groups strong concepts of fairness and the community existed \\n Distributive justice \\n was said by \\n Aristotle \\n to require that people were distributed goods and assets according to their merit \\n Socrates \\n Socrates \\n through \\n Plato \\n \\'s dialogue \\n Crito \\n is attributed with developing the idea of a \\n social contract \\n whereby people ought to follow the rules of a society and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits \\n During the Middle Ages religious scholars particularly such as \\n Thomas Aquinas \\n continued discussion of justice in various ways but ultimately connected being a good citizen to the purpose of serving God \\n After the \\n Renaissance \\n and \\n Reformation \\n the modern concept of social justice as developing human potential began to emerge through the work of a series of authors \\n Baruch Spinoza \\n in \\n On the Improvement of the Understanding \\n contended that the one true aim of life should be to acquire \"a human character much more stable than one\\'s own\" and to achieve this \"pitch of perfection The chief good is that he should arrive together with other individuals if possible at the possession of the aforesaid character \" \\n During the \\n enlightenment \\n and responding to the \\n French \\n and \\n American Revolutions \\n Thomas Paine \\n similarly wrote in \\n The Rights of Man \\n society should give \"genius a fair and universal chance\" and so \"the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions \" \\n Social justice \\n was coined by \\n Jesuit \\n priest \\n Luigi Taparelli \\n in the 1840s \\n The first modern usage of the specific term \"social justice\" is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s including the \\n Jesuit \\n Luigi Taparelli \\n in \\n Civilt Cattolica \\n based on the work of St \\n Thomas Aquinas \\n He argued that rival \\n capitalist \\n and \\n socialist \\n theories based on subjective \\n Cartesian \\n thinking undermined the unity of society present in \\n Thomistic \\n metaphysics \\n as neither were sufficiently concerned with \\n moral \\n philosophy \\n Writing in the influential British philosopher and economist \\n John Stuart Mill \\n stated in \\n Utilitarianism \\n his view that \"Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it that is who have deserved equally well absolutely This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice towards which all institutions and the efforts of all virtuous citizens should be made in the utmost degree to converge \" \\n In the later 19th and early 20th century social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy particularly in the work of \\n John Dewey \\n Roscoe Pound \\n and \\n Louis Brandeis \\n One of the prime concerns was the \\n Lochner era \\n decisions of the \\n US Supreme Court \\n to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement such as the \\n eight-hour day \\n or the right to join a \\n trade union \\n After the First World War the founding document of the \\n International Labour Organization \\n took up the same terminology in its preamble stating that \"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\" From this point the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse In the late 20th century a number of liberal and conservative thinkers notably \\n Friedrich von Hayek \\n rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything or meant too many things \\n However the concept remained highly influential particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as \\n John Rawls \\n Contemporary theory \\n Philosophical perspectives \\n Cosmic values \\n Hunter Lewis \\n \\' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for \\n conservation \\n as a key premise in social justice His manifesto on \\n sustainability \\n ties the continued thriving of human life to real conditions the environment supporting that life and associates injustice with the detrimental effects of \\n unintended consequences \\n of human actions Quoting classical Greek thinkers like \\n Epicurus \\n on the good of pursuing happiness Hunter also cites ornithologist naturalist and philosopher \\n Alexander Skutch \\n in his book Moral Foundations \\n The common feature which unites the activities most consistently forbidden by the moral codes of civilized peoples is that by their very nature they cannot be both habitual and enduring because they tend to destroy the conditions which make them possible \\n Pope Benedict XVI cites \\n Teilhard de Chardin \\n in a vision of the cosmos as a \\'living host\\' \\n embracing an understanding of ecology that includes humanity\\'s relationship to others that pollution affects not just the natural world but interpersonal relations as well Cosmic harmony justice and peace are closely interrelated \\n If you want to cultivate peace protect creation \\n John Rawls \\n John Rawls \\n Political philosopher \\n John Rawls \\n draws on the \\n utilitarian \\n insights of \\n Bentham \\n and \\n Mill \\n the \\n social contract \\n ideas of \\n John Locke \\n and the \\n categorical imperative \\n ideas of \\n Kant \\n His first statement of principle was made in \\n A Theory of Justice \\n where he proposed that \"Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others \" \\n A \\n deontological \\n proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in \\n absolutist \\n terms His views are definitively restated in \\n Political Liberalism \\n where society is seen \"as a fair system of co-operation over time from one generation to the next\" \\n All societies have a basic structure of social economic and political institutions both formal and informal In testing how well these elements fit and work together Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding Obviously not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen\\'s hypothetical agreement \\n The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes and to that extent X holds these powers as a \\n trustee \\n for the citizen \\n X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate The citizen therefore is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way \\n This applies to one person who represents a small group e g the organiser of a social event setting a dress code as equally as it does to national governments which are ultimate trustees holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries Governments that fail to provide for \\n welfare \\n of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments Rawls asserted that \"There is a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty \" \\n This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold to some extent the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome According to Rawls the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are \\n Freedom of thought \\n Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion philosophy and morality \\n Political liberties e g representative democratic institutions \\n freedom of speech \\n and the \\n press \\n and \\n freedom of assembly \\n Freedom of association \\n Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person namely freedom from slavery freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one\\'s occupation and \\n Rights and liberties covered by the \\n rule of law \\n Thomas Pogge \\n Thomas Pogge \\n \\'s arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable Pogge argues that social institutions have a \\n negative duty \\n to not harm the poor \\n Pogge speaks of \"institutional cosmopolitanism\" and assigns responsibility to institutional schemes \\n for deficits of human rights An example given is slavery and third parties A third party should not recognize or enforce slavery The institutional order should be held responsible only for deprivations of human rights that it establishes or authorizes The current institutional design he says systematically harms developing economies by enabling corporate tax evasion \\n illicit financial flows corruption trafficking of people and weapons \\n Joshua Cohen \\n disputes his claims based on the fact that some poor countries have done well with the current institutional design \\n Elizabeth Kahn argues that some of these responsibilities \\n vague \\n should apply globally \\n United Nations \\n The United Nations document \\n Social Justice in an Open World The Role of the United Nations \\n states that \"Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth \" \\n The term \"social justice\" was seen by the U N \"as a substitute for the protection of human rights and first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s At the initiative of the Soviet Union and with the support of developing countries the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development adopted in \" \\n The same document reports \"From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the \\n Universal Declaration of Human Rights \\n neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence repression and chaos \" \\n The report concludes \"Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent \\n redistributive policies \\n conceived and implemented by public agencies \" \\n The same UN document offers a concise history \" T he notion of social justice is relatively new None of historys great philosophersnot Plato or Aristotle or Confucius or Averroes or even Rousseau or Kantsaw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist \\n exploitation of labour \\n and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists By the mid-twentieth century the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world \" \\n Religious perspectives \\n Hinduism \\n The present-day \\n Jti \\n hierarchy is undergoing changes for a variety of

of social justice would require the rejection of \\n consumerism \\n and \\n communism \\n The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work However the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need It held that \\n zakat \\n alms-giving was not voluntary charity but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate \\n Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the \\n zakat \\n through taxes \\n Though monetary donations are the most practiced way of \\n zakat \\n Islam is deeply rooted in the tenets of \\n volunteerism \\n and \\n social activism \\n Areas of one\\'s communities which require assistance and beneficiaries must be a Muslim\\'s foci if need

vulnerable members of society Two of the seven key areas \\n of \"Catholic social teaching\" are pertinent to social justice \\n Life and dignity of the human person The foundational principle of all \"Catholic Social Teaching\" is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person from conception to natural death Human life must be valued above all material possessions \\n Preferential option for the poor and \\n vulnerable \\n Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the \\n Day of Judgement \\n God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy \"Amen I say to you whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine you did for me \" \\n The Catholic Church believes that through words prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with and compassion for the poor The moral test of any society is \"how it treats its most vulnerable members The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor \" \\n Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church \\n Pope Leo XIII \\n who studied under Taparelli published in the \\n encyclical \\n Rerum novarum \\n On the Condition of the Working Classes lit \"On new things\" rejecting both socialism and capitalism while defending labor unions and private property He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not \\n class conflict \\n and \\n competition \\n In this document Leo set out the Catholic Church\\'s response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony \\n The encyclical \\n Quadragesimo anno \\n On Reconstruction of the Social Order literally \"in the fortieth year\" of by \\n Pope Pius XI \\n encourages a \\n living wage \\n subsidiarity \\n and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just \\n Pope John Paul II \\n added much to the corpus of the \\n Catholic social teaching \\n penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics politics geo-political situations ownership of the means of production private property and the \" \\n social mortgage \\n \" and private property The encyclicals \\n Laborem exercens \\n Sollicitudo rei socialis \\n and \\n Centesimus annus \\n are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and \\n human rights \\n and spoke forcefully for the poor He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused and admits a fear that the \"progress\" of the world is not true progress at all if it should denigrate the value of the human person He argued in \\n Centesimus annus \\n that private property markets and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person \\n Pope Benedict XVI \\n \\'s encyclical \\n Deus caritas est \\n \"God is Love\" of claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics and not of the church which has charity as its central social concern It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church\\'s active role in social justice should be to inform the debate using reason and natural law and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics \\n The official Catholic doctrine on \\n social justice \\n can be found in the book \\n Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \\n published in and updated in by the \\n Pontifical Council \\n Iustitia et Pax \\n The Catechism contain more detail of the Church\\'s view of social justice \\n Criticism \\n Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice \\n Moral relativists \\n deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general \\n Non-cognitivists \\n moral skeptics \\n moral nihilists \\n and most \\n logical positivists \\n deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice \\n Political realists \\n believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the \\n status quo \\n citation needed \\n Many other people accept some of the basic principles of social justice such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this One example is the statement by \\n H G Wells \\n that all people are \"equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen \" \\n On the other hand some scholars reject the very idea of social justice as meaningless religious self-contradictory and ideological believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty Perhaps the most complete rejection of the concept of social justice comes from \\n Friedrich Hayek \\n of the \\n Austrian School \\n of economics \\n There can be no test by which we can discover what is \\'socially unjust\\' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined would appear just to us Social justice does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense like the term \\'a moral stone\\' \\n Ben O\\'Neill of the \\n University of New South Wales \\n argues that for proponents of \"social justice\" \\n the notion of \"rights\" is a mere term of entitlement indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good no matter how important or trivial abstract or tangible recent or ancient It is merely an assertion of desire and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire \\n In fact since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods paid for through the efforts of others the term actually refers to an intention to use \\n force \\n to acquire one\\'s desires Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action production and voluntary exchange but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them! \\n Janusz Korwin-Mikke \\n states \"Either \\'social justice\\' has the same meaning as \\'justice\\' or not If so why use the additional word \\'social?\\' We lose time we destroy trees to obtain paper necessary to print this word If not if \\'social justice\\' means something different from \\'justice\\' then \\'something different from justice\\' is by definition \\'injustice \\'\" \\n citation needed \\n Sociologist \\n Carl L Bankston \\n has argued that a secular leftist view of

Social justice is also a concept that is used to describe the movement towards a socially just world e g the \\n Global Justice Movement \\n In this context social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality and can be defined as \\n \"the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society\" \\n A number of \\n movements \\n are working to achieve social justice in society These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society regardless of background or procedural justice have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society \\n Liberation theology \\n Liberation theology \\n Liberation theology \\n is a movement in \\n Christian \\n theology \\n which conveys the teachings of \\n Jesus Christ \\n in terms of a liberation from unjust economic political or social conditions It has been described by proponents as \"an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor\\'s suffering their struggle and hope and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor\" \\n and by detractors as Christianity perverted by \\n Marxism \\n and \\n Communism \\n Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement it began as a movement within the \\n Catholic Church \\n in Latin America in the 1950s1960s It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region \\n It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s The term was coined by the \\n Peruvian \\n priest \\n Gustavo Gutirrez \\n who wrote one of the movement\\'s most famous books \\n A Theology of Liberation \\n According to \\n Sarah Kleeb \\n \"Marx would surely take issue \" she writes \"with the appropriation of his works in a religious context there is no way to reconcile Marx\\'s views of religion with those of Gutierrez they are simply incompatible Despite this in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path the two have much in common and particularly in the first edition of A Theology of Liberation the use of Marxian theory is quite evident \" \\n Other noted exponents are \\n Leonardo Boff \\n of Brazil \\n Carlos Mugica \\n of Argentina \\n Jon Sobrino \\n of El Salvador and \\n Juan Luis Segundo \\n of Uruguay \\n Health care \\n Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of \\n bioethics \\n Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care especially for low income households and families The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare \\n Ruth Faden \\n of the \\n Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics \\n and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings \\n Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations \\n These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level gender education or any other stratifying factors Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model \\n Human rights education \\n Human rights education \\n The \\n Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action

equalitarianism \\n is a school of thought that prioritizes \\n equality \\n for all people \\n According to the \\n Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\n Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or \\n social status \\n According to the \\n Merriam-Webster Dictionary \\n the term has two distinct definitions in modern English \\n either as a political \\n doctrine \\n that all people should be treated as equals and have the same \\n political \\n economic \\n social \\n and \\n civil rights \\n or as a social philosophy advocating the \\n removal of economic inequalities among people \\n economic egalitarianism \\n or the \\n decentralization of power \\n Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity \\n Forms \\n Legal egalitarianism \\n Equality of person \\n Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \\n Gender equality \\n Social egalitarianism \\n Economic \\n Egalitarianism and non-human animals \\n Religious and spiritual egalitarianism \\n Sikhism \\n Christianity \\n Judaism \\n Islam \\n Military egalitarianism \\n Modern egalitarianism theory \\n Reception \\n Marxism \\n Forms \\n Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include \\n communism \\n legal egalitarianism \\n luck egalitarianism \\n political egalitarianism \\n gender egalitarianism \\n racial equality \\n equality of outcome \\n and \\n Christian egalitarianism \\n Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical \\n Legal egalitarianism \\n Further information \\n equality before the law \\n One argument is that \\n liberalism \\n provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights \\n Equality of person \\n The \\n English Bill of Rights of \\n and the \\n United States Constitution \\n use only the term \"person\" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities except for a a reference to \"men\" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason and b a rule of proportional Congressional representation in the \\n 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \\n As the rest of the Constitution in its operative language the \\n 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \\n uses the term \"person\" stating for example that \" nor shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\" \\n Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \\n An example of this form is the \\n Tunisian Constitution of \\n which provides that \"men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties\" \\n Gender equality \\n The motto \" \\n Libert galit fraternit \\n \" was used during the \\n French Revolution \\n and is still used as an official motto of the French government The \\n Rights of Man and of the Citizen \\n French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind \\n The \\n Declaration of Independence of the United States \\n is an example of an assertion of equality of men the wording of \"men\" and \"man\" is a reference to both men and women i e \"mankind\" \\n all men are created equal \\n \" \\n John Locke \\n is sometimes considered the founder of this form \\n Many state constitutions in the United States also use \"rights of man\" language rather than \"rights of person\" since the noun \"man\" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women \\n It is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women \\n Social egalitarianism \\n At a cultural level egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are \\n socialism \\n communism \\n social anarchism \\n libertarian socialism \\n left-libertarianism \\n and \\n progressivism \\n some of which propound \\n economic egalitarianism \\n Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among \\n intellectuals \\n and in the general populations of many countries However whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question A position of opposition to egalitarianism is anti-egalitarianism \\n Economic \\n An early example of equality of outcome economic egalitarianism is \\n Xu Xing \\n a scholar of the Chinese philosophy of \\n agriculturalism \\n who supported the \\n fixing of prices \\n and in which all similar goods and services regardless of differences in quality and demand are set at exactly the same unchanging price \\n In \\n socialism \\n social ownership \\n of \\n means of production \\n is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership the \\n surplus product \\n generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another Although the economist \\n Karl Marx \\n is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether However Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific \\n economic systems \\n The American economist \\n John Roemer \\n has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of \\n distributive justice \\n shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be \\n proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production \\n is inadequate Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized \\n Egalitarianism and non-human animals \\n Many philosophers including Ingmar Persson \\n Peter Vallentyne \\n Nils Holtug \\n and \\n Lewis Gompertz \\n have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that \"Egalitarianism implies rejecting \\n speciesism \\n and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals as well as assisting them \\n in nature \\n \" \\n Furthermore Horta argues that \"because nonhuman animals are worse off in comparison to humans egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests nonhuman animals \" \\n Religious and spiritual egalitarianism \\n Sikhism \\n The \\n Sikh \\n faith was founded upon egalitarian principles reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race but also between the genders This equality led to denunciation of sati the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the \\n funeral pyres \\n of deceased husbands albeit being very rare at the time but occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation than becoming the bounty of war for the marauding \\n jihadists \\n that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism with greater rigidity than the \\n Hindu \\n archetype from which the practice was inherited \\n Despite the rhetoric of equality scholars have \"found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh\\'s of low castes\" \\n Furthermore despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism denouncing sexism female infanticide dowry sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolationthe reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent like \\n Hindus \\n Buddhists \\n and \\n Jains \\n Christianity \\n Main articles \\n Christian egalitarianism \\n Christian communism \\n and \\n Christian universalism \\n The \\n Christian egalitarian \\n view holds that the \\n Bible \\n teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes all economic classes and all age groups but within the teachings and example of \\n Jesus Christ \\n God \\n and the overarching principles of scripture \\n Within the wide range of \\n Christianity \\n there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups some of which are \\n complementarians \\n There many that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure for example parents having authority over their children These ideas are considered by some to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism At its foundation \\n Galatians \\n holds \"There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus\" defining all as equal in the sight of God Similarly \\n Colossians \\n says \"Here there is no Gentile or Jew circumcised or uncircumcised barbarian \\n Scythian \\n slave or free but Christ is all and is in all\" defining all as equal in the sight of God in relationship to faith in Jesus Christ Various Christian groups have attempted to hold to this view and develop Christian oriented communities In \\n Acts \\n chapter members of the early Christian community sell their possessions give the proceeds to a common fund overseen by the disciples then take \"according to their need\" One of the most notable of present-day communities are the \\n Hutterite \\n groups of Europe and North America living in agricultural and collective communities \\n Judaism \\n Judaism \\n is not a \\n universalist \\n religion and teaches that \\n Jews \\n defined as either the biological descendants of \\n Jacob \\n \"Israel\" the son of Isaac and grandson of \\n Abraham \\n or someone who converted have a specific covenant with \\n God \\n as a \\n chosen people \\n Deutoronomy \\n \"chosen as God\\'s \\n treasured people \\n \" to serve as an example of \\n God\\'s light \\n to the rest of the world The oral Torah and \\n Rabbinic literature \\n codified in the \\n Talmud \\n makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the \\n gentiles \\n literally \"the nations\" However Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the \\n Seven Laws of Noah \\n In this aspect Judaism is universalist in its divine message but not in its religious obligations In \\n reform \\n and \\n conservative Judaism \\n egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations \\n Synagogues \\n that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating i e no \\n mechitza \\n and allow women to lead \\n services \\n with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the \\n Torah \\n Islam \\n The \\n Islamic \\n stance on equality is not similar to that of Christianity it doesn\\'t stress that all humans are equal in the eyes of God regardless of gender class and race The \\n Quran \\n states \"O mankind indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another Indeed the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you Indeed Allah is Knowing and Acquainted\" \\n Louise Marlow\\'s \\n Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought \\n compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice \\n Military egalitarianism \\n Military egalitarianism has been noted since ancient times such as with Shakespeare\\'s \\n St Crispin\\'s Day Speech \\n This occurs in spite of the distinctions military forces attempt to make between officers and enlisted men For example former Major General \\n Charles J Dunlap Jr \\n said that \\n United States Air Force \\n culture included an egalitarianism bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft \\n Modern egalitarianism theory \\n Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically politically and socially Modern egalitarianism theory or \"new egalitarianism\" outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other In essence the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talentsthese differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other \\n Reception \\n The \\n cultural theory of risk \\n holds egalitarianism as defined by a negative attitude towards rules and principles and a positive attitude towards group decision-making with \\n fatalism \\n termed as its opposite \\n The theory distinguishes between \\n hierarchists \\n who are positive towards both rules and groups and egalitarianists who are positive towards groups but negative towards rules \\n This is by definition a form of \"anarchist equality\" as referred to by \\n Berkman \\n The fabric of an \"egalitarianist society\" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit \\n peer pressure \\n rather than by explicit rules and punishment However Thompson et al theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective be it egalitarianist hierarchist \\n individualist \\n fatalist \\n or \\n autonomist \\n will be inherently unstable the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling For instance although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles \\n Accordingly egalitarianists have no power except through their presence unless they by definition reluctantly embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group autonomists or individualists \\n Alexander Berkman \\n suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp True anarchist equality implies freedom not quantity It does not mean that every one must eat drink or wear the same things do the same work or live in the same manner Far from it the very reverse in fact Individual needs and tastes differ as appetites differ It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality Far from levelling such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development For human character is diverse\" \\n Marxism \\n Karl Marx \\n and \\n Friedrich Engels \\n believed that a revolution would bring about a \\n socialist \\n society which would then eventually give way to a \\n communist \\n stage of social development which would be a classless stateless humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability to each according to his needs\" \\n However \\n Marxism \\n rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property Marx\\'s view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest such as a universal notion of \"equality\" but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desiresthus Marx\\'s notion of \\n communist society \\n is radically individualistic \\n Marx was a proponent of two principles the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society \" \\n To each according to his contribution \\n \" and \" \\n From each according to their ability to each according to their needs \\n \" Although Marx\\'s position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic \\n \"

Environmental protection \\n is a practice of protecting the \\n natural environment \\n on individual organization controlled on governmental levels for the benefit of both the environment and humans Due to the pressures of \\n overconsumption \\n population and technology the \\n biophysical environment \\n is being degraded sometimes permanently This has been recognized and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause \\n environmental degradation \\n Since the 1960s activity of \\n environmental movements \\n has created awareness of the various \\n environmental problems \\n There is no agreement on the extent of the \\n environmental impact of human activity \\n and even \\n scientific dishonesty \\n occurs so protection measures are occasionally debated \\n Approaches with regards to environmental protection \\n Voluntary environmental agreements \\n Ecosystems approach \\n International environmental agreements \\n Government \\n Tanzania \\n History of environmental protection \\n Government protection \\n China \\n European Union \\n Russia \\n Latin America \\n Brazil \\n Mexico \\n Oceania \\n Australia \\n New Zealand \\n Switzerland \\n United States \\n In literature \\n Approaches with regards to environmental protection \\n Voluntary environmental agreements \\n In industrial countries voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of best environmental practice For instance in India Environment Improvement Trust EIT has been working for environment & forest protection since A group of Green Volunteers get a goal of Green India Clean India concept CA Gajendra Kumar Jain a Chartered Accountant is the founder of Environment Improvement Trust in Sojat city a small village of State of Rajasthan in India \\n In developing countries such as throughout Latin America these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation \\n The challenges that exist with these agreements lie in establishing baseline data targets monitoring and reporting Due to the difficulties inherent in evaluating effectiveness their use is often questioned and indeed the whole environment may well be adversely affected as a result The key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity \\n Ecosystems approach \\n An \\n ecosystems \\n approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges Ideally the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments as well as representatives of industry environmental groups and community This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation Religions also play an important role in conservation of environment Ref-Hadiya Habib Role of religious education and different religions in conservation and maintenance of environment www oiirj org vol July special issue \\n International environmental agreements \\n Kyoto Protocol Commitment map \\n Many of the earth\\'s resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across many countries As a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate oceans rivers and air pollution These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and at other times are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as in Europe America and Africa \\n Some of the most well-known international agreements include the Kyoto Protocol and others \\n Government \\n Kyoto Protocol \\n Discussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government legislation and law enforcement However in its broadest sense environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry indigenous groups environmental group and community representatives Gradually environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries \\n Many constitutions acknowledge the fundamental right to environmental protection and many international treaties acknowledge the right to live in a healthy environment \\n Also many countries have organizations and agencies devoted to environmental protection There are international environmental protection organizations such as the \\n United Nations Environment Programme \\n Although environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of government agencies most people view these agencies as being of prime importance in establishing and maintaining basic standards that protect both the environment and the people interacting with it \\n Tanzania \\n Tanzania \\n is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas including several national parks \\n The concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth expansion of subsistence agriculture pollution timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel \\n Zebras at the Serengeti savana plains in Tanzania \\n 1gbpx|frame|center|environment \\n History of environmental protection \\n Environmental protection in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa 1884-1919 colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting firewood collecting and cattle grazing \\n In year Serengeti was officially established as the first national park for wild cats in East Africa Since there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council NEMC and the development of an environmental act In Environment Improvement Trust EIT start working for environment & forest protection in India from a small city Sojat Founder of Environment Improvement Trust is CA Gajendra Kumar Jain working with volunteers \\n Government protection \\n Division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection It does this through the formulation of policy coordinating and monitoring environmental issues environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research The National Environment Management Council NEMC is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues The NEMC the following purposes provide technical advice coordinate technical activities develop enforcement guidelines and procedures assess monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment promote and assist environmental information and communication and seek advancement of scientific knowledge \\n The National Environment Policy of acts as a framework for environmental decision making in Tanzania The policy objectives are to achieve the following \\n Ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources without degrading the environment or risking health or safety \\n Prevent and control degradation of land water vegetation and air \\n Conserve and enhance natural and man-made heritage including biological diversity of unique ecosystems \\n Improve condition and productivity of degraded areas \\n Raise awareness and understanding of the link between environment and development \\n Promote individual and community participation \\n Promote international cooperation \\n Tanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment and the Convention on Biological Diversity The Environmental Management Act is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions The policy tools that are parts of the act includes the use of environmental-impact assessments strategics environmentals assessments and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products The effectiveness of shifing of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that historically there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice \\n China \\n The \\n Longwanqun National Forest Park \\n is a nationally protected nature area in Huinan County Jilin China \\n Formal environmental protection in China House was first stimulated by the \\n United Nations Conference on the Human Environment \\n held in Stockholm Sweden Following this they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy In the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China\\'s basic national policies and in the National Environmental Protection Agency NEPA was established Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency SEPA meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level In SEPA became known by its current name of \\n Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People\\'s Republic of China \\n MEP \\n Pollution control

were calculated at 7% of China\\'s GDP This grew to 3% by and the economic loss from water pollution 1% began to exceed that caused by air pollution \\n China has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth 64% in the past ten years \\n However the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries In China was ranked 121st out of countries on the \\n Environmental Performance Index \\n China has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation \\n China\\'s investment in renewable energy grew 18% in to $15 billion accounting for ~10% of the global investment in this area \\n In spending on the environment was 49% of GDP up times from \\n The discharge of CO carbon monoxide and SO2 sulfur dioxide decreased by 61% and 95% in compared with that in \\n China\\'s protected nature reserves have increased substantially In there were only compared with in The protected nature reserve system now occupies 5% of the country this is higher than the world average \\n Rapid growth in GDP has been China\\'s main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high GDP For China to develop sustainably environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies \\n Quote from Shengxian Zhou head of MEP \"Good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure production form and develop model \" \\n European Union \\n Environmental protection has become an important task for the institutions of the European Community after the \\n Maastricht Treaty \\n for the European Union ratification by all the Member States The EU is already very active in the field of environmental policy with important directives like those on \\n environmental impact assessment \\n and on the \\n access to environmental information \\n for citizens in the Member States \\n Russia \\n In \\n Russia \\n environmental protection is considered an

Brazilian Ministry of the Environment in Portuguese Ministrio do Meio Ambiente MMA \\n It was first created in year with the name Special Secretariat for the Environment Secretaria Especial de Meio Ambiente changing names several times and adopting the final name in year The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues \\n A national policy for the environment and for water resources \\n A policy for the preservation conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems biodiversity and forests \\n Proposing strategies mechanisms economic and social instruments for improving environmental quality and sustainable use of natural resources \\n Policies for integrating production and the environment \\n Environmental policies and programs for the Legal Amazon \\n Ecological

biodiversity and second in \\n mammals \\n one estimate indicates that over 50% of all animal and plant species live in Mexico \\n The history of environmental policy in Mexico started in the 1940s with the enactment of the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water in Spanish Ley de Conservacin de Suelo y Agua Three decades later at the beginning of the 1970s the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminacin Ambiental \\n In year was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues It established the administrative organization of the Secretariat for the Improvement of the Environment Subsecretara para el Mejoramiento del Ambiente in the Department of Health and Welfare \\n The \\n axolotl \\n is an endemic species from the central part of Mexico \\n The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources Secretara del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales \\n

goods and environmental services and to facilitate their use and sustainable development \\n Develop and implement a national policy on natural resources \\n Promote environmental management within the national territory in coordination with all levels of government and the private sector \\n Evaluate and provide determination to the environmental impact statements for development projects and prevention of ecological damage \\n Implement national policies on climate change and protection of the ozone layer \\n Direct work and studies on national meteorological climatological hydrological

currently there are covering an area of hectares increasing federally protected areas from 6% to 85% its land area \\n Oceania \\n Australia \\n The \\n Great Barrier Reef \\n in Australia is the largest barrier reef in the world \\n In there was \\n ha \\n of terrestrial protected area covering 8% of the land area of \\n Australia \\n The figures of 1% of terrestrial area and ha of protected marine area \\n were found to poorly represent about half of Australia\\'s bioregions \\n Environmental protection in Australia could be seen as starting with the formation of the first National Park \\n Royal National Park \\n in \\n More progressive environmental protection had it start in the 1960s and 1970s with major international programs such as the \\n United Nations Conference on the Human Environment \\n in the Environment Committee of the \\n OECD \\n in and the \\n United Nations Environment Programme \\n of \\n These events laid the foundations by increasing public awareness and support for regulation State environmental legislation was irregular and deficient until the Australian Environment Council AEC and Council of Nature Conservation Ministers CONCOM were established in and creating a forum to assist in coordinating environmental and conservation policies between states and neighbouring countries \\n These councils have since been replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council ANZECC in and finally the Environment Protection and Heritage Council EPHC in \\n At a national level the \\n Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act \\n is the primary environmental protection legislation for the Commonwealth of Australia It concerns matters of national and international environmental significance regarding flora fauna ecological communities and cultural heritage \\n It also has jurisdiction over any activity conducted by the Commonwealth or affecting it that has significant environmental impact \\n The act covers eight main areas \\n National Heritage Sites \\n World Heritage Sites \\n RAMSAR \\n wetlands \\n Nationally endangered or \\n threatened species \\n and ecological communities \\n Nuclear activities and actions \\n Great Barrier Reef Marine Park \\n Migratory species \\n Commonwealth Marine areas \\n There are several Commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners such as \\n Kakadu National Park \\n extraordinary biodiversity such as \\n Christmas Island National Park \\n or managed cooperatively due to cross-state location such as the \\n Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves \\n At a state level the bulk of environmental protection issues are left to the responsibility of the state or territory \\n Each state in Australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies Their jurisdiction is similar and covers point-source pollution such as from industry or commercial activities land/water use and waste management Most protected lands are managed by states and territories \\n with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness national land and marine parks state forests and conservation areas States also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air water and sound pollution \\n At a local level each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation This includes non-point source or diffuse pollution such as sediment pollution from construction sites \\n Australia ranks second place on the UN \\n Human Development Index \\n and one of the lowest debt to \\n GDP \\n ratios of the developed economies \\n This could be seen as coming at the cost of the environment with Australia being the world leader in coal exportation \\n and species extinctions \\n Some have been motivated to proclaim it is Australia\\'s responsibility to set the example of environmental reform for the rest of the world to follow \\n New Zealand \\n At a national level the \\n Ministry for the Environment \\n is responsible for environmental policy and the \\n
