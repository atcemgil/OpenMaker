      " Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses' They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology as would otherwise apply say in the case of a joint-venture Further there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology \n",
      " The utility viability and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology For instance should the key patent on the technology have expired or would expire in a short while the residual viability of the technology may be limited although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as \n",

      " Innovation by users and lead users \n",
      " User innovation \n",
      " is the idea that more users and consumers than suppliers are the innovators of new products Eric von Hippel was one of the first to notice this trend and explore it Products made by manufacturers are typically developed to meet a wide range of the needs of a wide range of people Therefore when a particular user experiences needs that are not yet felt by the majority of consumers they make the adjustments themselves to meet their own needs Often these ideas are then fed back to manufacturing companies from these users in the hope that the product will then be produced for them This process is called \"free revealing\" User innovation can be seen across a wide range of products from home cleaning equipment to medical devices In the field of scientific instruments Hippel's research has even found that user innovation is a dominant influence \n",
      " User innovation extends not only to tangible products but also to services Hippel found that eighty-five percent of individuals self-provided themselves with accounting and banking processes before banks offered this service \n",
      " More recently with \n",
      " Pedro Oliveira \n",
      " and colleagues studied the role of patients of \n",
      " chronic diseases \n",
      " and their caregivers in creating new solutions to help them cope with their health conditions They administered a survey to \n",
      " rare disease \n",
      " patients/caregivers and found that individuals 8% of the sample reported solutions that they personally find valuable and that are also evaluated as novel by expert medical evaluators If anything like this fraction of innovators holds for the overall population of hundreds of millions of people world-wide estimated to be afflicted by rare diseases patients and their caregivers may be a tremendous potential resource to improve management and care for many who are similarly afflicted \n",
      " An extension of user innovations is the idea of \n",
      " lead users \n",
      " These are the individuals who first feel the need for a product or service and create it for themselves Lead user identification is an essential method used by companies to identify the newest innovations in their product areas giving them crucial insight on the needs of their users \n",
      " Innovation toolkits \n",
      " On Eric von Hippel's website it is stated that innovation toolkits are used to organize and support information that is shared amongst various users and producers of projects \n",
      " In one of his papers entitled \"Perspective User toolkits for innovation \" Hippel describes how user toolkits can be used to help manufacturers and companies determine the users' need-related aspects of products and services The users are provided with \"user toolkits for innovation \" to help the manufacturer outsource tasks that would normally take much time and effort within the company One of the first areas that user toolkits have been used was in the design and manufacturing of custom integrated circuits \n",
      " In this field it was critical that manufacturers understood user needs because it could result in months of delays costing the company thousands of dollars LSI Logic produced a software design tool that its customers could use to design circuits themselves This move helped LSI grow to be one of the major players in the custom IC market and competitors were soon moving in the same direction \n",
      " \"Toolkits for user innovation are coordinated sets of \"user-friendly\" design tools that enable users to develop new product innovations for themselves The toolkits are not general purpose Rather they are specific to the design challenges of a specific field or sub field such as integrated circuit design or software product design \" \n",
      " Toolkits should have the following features \n",
      " Learning by trial-and-error \n",
      " An appropriate solution space \n",
      " A user-friendly toolkit \n",
      " Commonly used modules \n",
      " Result easily created by user \n",
      " Sticky information and its uses \n",
      " Sticky information is information that is expensive to obtain transmit and employ in a new location compared to where it originated \"We define the stickiness of a given unit of information in a given instance as the incremental expenditure required to transfer that unit of information to a specified locus in a form usable by a given information seeker When this cost is low information stickiness is low when it is high stickiness is high \" Eric von Hippel \n",
      " Eric von Hippel has worked to define how sticky information influences innovation and how to overcome stickiness when trying to develop a new technology Sticky information is often encountered when a manufacturers would like to know about how current users feel about their needs and if their needs are being met or not by current product lines However this information would be difficult to acquire for the manufacturer though it would be tremendously helpful in their pursuit of product innovation \n",
      " Information can be sticky for a number of reasons Much information that humans have is tacit and therefore is difficult to communicate when sharing information Additionally some technical information is composed of a very large number of parts Sometimes it is difficult to communicate all of these especially when some operating procedures or techniques are so routine a regular practitioner may forget to include such details \n",
      " The stickiness of a particular type of information can have influences on how advances are made in the field For example if a particular company holds much of the expertise and knowledge for a particular technology it will likely be difficult for another company to make advancements that originate from the original technology Innovations are more likely to occur in the original company This can also occur in a geographic manner Local information can also be sticky and innovations that help a particular area with a special problem are likely to come from that area as well \n",
      " Measurements of innovation and innovation indicators \n",
      " Researchers have not started quantifying user innovation until recently It is important that researchers are able to measure innovation and gather statistics so that policymakers can see the impact of user innovation on modern day technologies Research has shown that many of the innovative products produced by manufacturers were ideas stemmed off from \"lead users \" \n",
      " Eric von Hippel has written several papers regarding \"Measurements of Innovation\" and \"Innovation Indicators \" In one of his papers he discusses his work with Fred Gault to survey Canadian manufacturing plants to determine the prevalence of user innovation They were able to determine that \"About 20% of the user-innovators surveyed reported transferring their innovations to other users and/or equipment suppliers and the majority of these at least sometimes did so at no charge to recipients \" \n",
      " These types of innovation indicators will help the government and other researchers to see the impact of users on innovation \n",
      " Innovation strategies and lead user identification \n",
      " Eric von Hippel has focused on the following major areas of innovation strategies in his research \n",
      " Task partitioning \n",
      " Improvement of innovation processes \n",
      " Pyramiding \n",
      " Task partitioning refers to innovation projects that are partitioned into smaller tasks Hippel proposes that \"problem-solving inter-dependence among tasks can be predicted in many projects and can then be managed by strategies involving adjustment of the task specifications and/or reduction of the barriers to problem-solving interaction across selected or all task boundaries \" \n",
      " Hippel calls attention to the improvement of innovation processes with great detail He feels that the processes call for more scrutiny and that in turn \"their improvement can significantly affect the kinds of research problems that can be addressed the efficiency and speed with which R&D can be performed and the competitive positions of firms employing them \" \n",
      " In his published work Hippel considers it critical for market researchers to look for lead users \"users who are on the leading edge of each identified trend in terms of related new product and process and who expect to obtain a relatively high net benefit from solutions to those needs \" \n",
      " Pyramiding is a search process based upon the view that people with a strong interest in a topic or field tend to know people more expert than themselves von Hippel states that it can sometimes be hard to identify lead users or the next CEO of any given company and pyramiding can assist in this process \n",

      " Hippel hopes to measure how many users innovate and what types of people do this type of work He would like to show that most innovation is still user innovation He finds it interesting that in the United Kingdom some 8% million people of consumers modify the products they use He has also noted that hospitals have the right to develop and use ideas as long as they do not sell them and he would like to persuade the institutional review board to approve development in hospital use In this way doctors would do innovation first and then companies could harness the benefits of such innovation He has stressed that the number of consumers modifying products and thereby innovating outweighs the number of people doing this in companies \n",

      " creativity \n",
      " which is merely the generation of a novel idea that may not necessarily be put into operationthough these words are sometimes used interchangeably in research literature when speaking about innovation leadership Innovation leadership is a complex concept as there is no single explanation or formula for a leader to follow to increase innovation As a result innovation leadership encompasses a variety of different activities actions and behaviors that interact to produce an innovative outcome \n",
      " Value-added Innovation \n",
      " Exploratory and value-added innovation require different leadership styles and behaviors to succeed \n",
      " Value-added innovation PwC involves refining and revising an existing product or service and typically requires minimal risk taking compared to exploratory innovation which often involves taking a large risk in this case it is most appropriate for a leader for innovation to adopt a transactional form of leadership \n",
      " This is because a transactional leadership style does not use open leadership behaviors such as encouraging employees to experiment and take risks but rather uses closed leadership behaviors that do not condone or reward risk-taking Companies whose innovation leaders use transactional leadership for value-added innovation purposes include Toyota Motor Co General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co \n",
      " examples of these companies value-added innovations such as making improvements on existing cars by making them faster more comfortable and getting better gas mileage \n",
      " Occasionally a value-added innovation may require a completely new way of thinking and possibly taking new risks An example of this scenario can be illustrated through Aspirin this was an existing product traditionally used as an analgesic to alleviate aches and pains but has been introduced into a new and different market by extending its uses to help prevent heart attack and reduce blot clot formation In this example the usage of an existing product was re-worked and introduced into a new market While an existing product is being changed and/or improved upon characterizing it as a value-added innovation outside-the-box thinking research and risk-taking are now required since it is being introduced into a new market In this case a transformational leadership style is a more appropriate style to use \n",
      " The innovation leader must gauge if and how much risk and radical thinking are involved in the value-added innovation to determine which leadership style to use in a situation The leader must be flexibleable to switch leadership behaviors when necessary \n",
      " Exploratory Innovation \n",
      " Exploratory innovation refers to the generation of novel ideas strategies and solutions through the use of strictly open behaviors exhibited most often by transformational leaders The foundation of exploratory innovation is characterized by search discovery experimentation and risk taking It is the organizations focus on generating new ideas products and strategies in contrast to exploitative innovation which focuses on building and extending already existing ideas Some studies have shown that explorative and exploitative innovation require different structures strategies processes capabilities and cultures \n",
      " See Innovative Organizational Climate/Culture Exploratory innovation requires flexibility opportunism adaptability and for leaders to provide intellectual stimulation to their subordinates \n",
      " In this approach to innovation the leadership style that is primarily used is transformational The behaviors exhibited are believed to achieve the desired creative outcome from employees through the application of individualized consideration charisma and inspirational motivation \n",
      " For example in one study of the innovation practices at AXA Insurance in Ireland the CEO John ONeil engaged in transformational leadership behaviors and introduced the MadHouse program that combined workers from different departments and levels of the organization to work together in a creative way The result of this experiment after six months was new business ideas for products and services \n",

      " The technical coefficient represents the efficiency of the system in use for particular resource and expresses the average state of technology The decrease of \"T\" would indicate a gain in efficiency however I could still be growing or remaining stable if the improved technology is not sufficient to compensate the effect of an increase in \"P\" and \"A\" Therefore a reduction in I would always mean that pressure on resources has lightened but this might not always be the consequence of using resources more efficiently reducing T \n",

      " This is where induced innovation steps in \n",
      " In order to best explain how Hicks macroeconomic theory works let us consider a situation in which the demand for agricultural derived products increases as a result of either population growth or increased household income Theory states that in such a situation prices of inputs for which supply is inelastic will rise relative to prices of more elastic inputs Similarly if the supply of a particular input increases at a faster rate than the supply of other inputs the price of such input will decline relative to the price of the other factors of production used Ideally then farmers would be looking to replace or use less of the more inelastic and less responsive factors of production since they are the more expensive to use Therefore technical innovations that replace such inputs would guarantee less costs and hence more profits In other words when demand for their products increases farmers are lured by changes in relative prices to seek for technological alternatives that substitute the increasingly scarce factors of production \n",
      " Here is where the government has to intervene Clearly agricultural workers cant develop these innovations themselves and therefore demand that public research institutions develop new technologies that will then be transformed into modernized machinery that agricultural supply firms can sell to local farmers Scientists will now study the best solution to this problem and respond by making the appropriate technical development such that producers can efficiently substitute the abundant inputs for the increasingly scarce factors Ultimately this will lead to a reduction of farmers unit costs in the best possible way \n",

      " Similarly economist Skarstein takes a detached position from Hicks theory He argues that the induced innovation cant be an automatic outcome of an increase in factor prices Shifting factor prices would not lead to any innovations in factor saving techniques it will merely induce a change in techniques along the prevailing substitution line he argues This change will take place as soon as the relative factor prices shift When the change has taken place there is no further incentive to move inwards to a more efficient technology \n",

      " The concept of a technological innovation system was introduced as part of a wider theoretical school called the \n",

      " approach The central idea behind this approach is that determinants of technological change are not only to be found in individual firms or in research institutes but also in a broad societal structure in which firms as well as knowledge institutes are embedded \n",
      " Since the 1980s innovation system studies have pointed out the influence of societal structures on technological change and indirectly on long-term economic growth within nations sectors or technological fields \n",
      " The purpose of analyzing a Technological Innovation System is to analyze and evaluate the development of a particular technological field in terms of the structures and processes that support or hamper it Besides its particular focus there are two more analytical features that set the Technological Innovation System approach apart from other innovation system approaches \n",
      " Firstly the Technological Innovation System concept emphasizes that stimulating knowledge flows is not sufficient to induce technological change and economic performance There is a need to exploit this knowledge in order to create new business opportunities This stresses the importance of individuals as sources of innovation something which is sometimes overseen in the more macro-oriented nationally or sectorally oriented innovation system approaches \n",
      " Secondly the Technological Innovation System approach often focuses on system dynamics \n",
      " The focus on entrepreneurial action has encouraged scholars to consider a Technological Innovation System as something to be built up over time This was already put forward by Carlsson and Stankiewicz \n",
      " T echnological Innovation Systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordinary goods and services They consist of dynamic knowledge and competence networks In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass such networks can be transformed into development blocks i e synergistic clusters of firms and technologies within an industry or a group of industries \n",
      " This means that a Technological Innovation System may be analyzed in terms of its system components and/or in terms of its dynamics Both perspectives will be explained below \n",
      " Structures \n",
      " The system components of a Technological Innovation System are called structures These represent the static aspect of the system as they are relatively stable over time Three basic categories are distinguished \n",
      " Actors \n",
      " Actors involve organizations contributing to a technology as a developer or adopter or indirectly as a regulator financier etc It is the actors of a Technological Innovation System that through choices and actions actually generate diffuse and utilize technologies The potential variety of relevant actors is enormous ranging from private actors to public actors and from technology developers to technology adopters The development of a Technological Innovation System will depend on the interrelations between all these actors For example entrepreneurs are unlikely to start investing in their businesses if governments are unwilling to support them financially Visa-verse governments have no clue where financial support is necessary if entrepreneurs do not provide them with the information and the arguments they need to legitimate policy support \n",
      " Institutions \n",
      " Institutional structures are at the core of the innovation system concept \n",
      " It is common to consider institutions as the rules of the game in a society or more formally the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction \n",
      " A distinction can be made between formal institutions and informal institutions with formal institutions being the rules that are codified and enforced by some authority and informal institutions being more tacit and organically shaped by the collective interaction of actors Informal institutions can be normative or cognitive The normative rules are social norms and values with moral significance whereas cognitive rules can be regarded as collective mind frames or social paradigms \n",
      " Examples of formal institutions are government laws and policy decisions firm directives or contracts also belong to this category An example of a normative rule is the responsibility felt by a company to prevent or clean up waste Examples of cognitive rules are search heuristics or problem-solving routines They also involve dominant visions and expectations held by the actors \n",
      " Technological factors \n",
      " Technological structures consist of artefacts and the technological infrastructures in which they are integrated They also involve the techno-economic workings of such artefacts including costs safety reliability These features are crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms between technological change and institutional change For example if R&D subsidy schemes supporting technology development should result in improvements with regard to the safety and reliability of applications this would pave the way for more elaborate support schemes including practical demonstrations These may in turn benefit technological improvements even more It should however be noted here that the importance of technological features has often been neglected by scholars \n",
      " The structural factors are merely the elements that make up the system In an actual system these factors are all linked to each other If they form dense configurations they are called networks An example would be a coalition of firms jointly working on the application of a fuel cell guided by a set of problem-solving routines and supported by a subsidy program Likewise industry associations research communities policy networks user-supplier relations etc are all examples of networks \n",
      " An analysis of structures typically yields insight into systemic features - complementarities and conflicts - that constitute drivers and barriers for technology diffusion at a certain moment or within a given period in time \n",
      " Dynamics \n",
      " Structures involve elements that are relatively stable over time Nevertheless for many technologies especially newly emerging ones these structures are not yet fully in place For this reason mostly the scholars have recently enriched the literature on Technological Innovation Systems with studies that focus on the build-up of structures over time The central idea of this approach is to consider all activities that contribute to the development diffusion and use of innovations as system functions \n",
      " These system functions are to be understood as types of activities that influence the build-up of a Technological Innovation System Each system function may be fulfilled in a variety of ways The premise is that in order to properly develop the system should positively fulfil all system functions Various lists of system functions have been constructed Authors like Bergek et al \n",
      " Hekkert et al \n",
      " Negro \n",
      " and Suurs \n",
      " give useful overviews These lists show much overlap and differences reside mostly in the particular way of clustering activities An example of such a list is provided below \n",
      " Note that it is also possible that activities negatively contribute to a system function These negative contributions imply a partial breakdown of the system In particular domestic instability has been shown to exert downward pressure on innovation systems while international threats and national security alliances have a significantly positive effect on national innovative performance \n",
      " Seven system functions \n",
      " As an example the seven system functions defined by Hekkert are explained here \n",
      " F1 Entrepreneurial activities \n",
      " The classic role of the entrepreneur is to translate knowledge into business opportunities and eventually innovations The entrepreneur does this by performing market-oriented experiments that establish change both to the emerging technology and to the institutions that surround it The Entrepreneurial Activities involve projects aimed to prove the usefulness of the emerging technology in a practical and/or commercial environment Such projects typically take the form of experiments and demonstrations \n",
      " F2 Knowledge development \n",
      " The Knowledge Development function involves learning activities mostly on the emerging technology but also on markets networks users etc There are various types of learning activities the most important categories being learning-by-searching and learning-by-doing The former concerns \n",
      " R&D \n",
      " activities in basic science whereas the latter involves learning activities in a practical context for example in the form of laboratory experiments or adoption trials \n",
      " F3 Knowledge diffusion / knowledge exchange through networks \n",
      " The characteristic organization structure of a Technological Innovation System is that of the network The primary function of networks is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between all the actors involved in it Knowledge Diffusion activities involve partnerships between actors for example technology developers but also meetings like workshops and conferences The important role of Knowledge Diffusion stems from Lundvalls notion of interactive learning as the raison-dtre of any innovation system \n",
      " The innovation system approach stresses that innovation happens only where actors of different backgrounds interact A special form of interactive learning is learning-by-using which involves learning activities based on the experience of users of technological innovations for example through user-producer interactions \n",
      " F4 Guidance of the search \n",
      " The Guidance of the Search function refers to activities that shape the needs requirements and expectations of actors with respect to their further support of the emerging technology Guidance of the Search refers to individual choices related to the technology but it may also take the form of hard institutions for example policy targets It also refers to promises and expectations as expressed by various actors in the community Guidance of the Search can be positive or negative A positive Guidance of the Search means a convergence of positive signals - expectations promises policy directives - in a particular direction of technology development If negative there will be a digression or even worse a rejection of development altogether This convergence is important since usually various technological options exist within an emerging technological field all of which require investments in order to develop further Since resources are usually limited it is important that specific foci are chosen After all without any focus there will be a dilution of resources preventing all options from prospering On the other hand too much focus may result in the loss of variety A healthy Technological Innovation System will strike a balance between creating and reducing variety \n",
      " F5 Market formation \n",
      " Emerging technologies cannot be expected to compete with incumbent technologies In order to stimulate innovation it is usually necessary to create artificial niche markets The Market Formation function involves activities that contribute to the creation of a demand for the emerging technology for example by financially supporting the use of the emerging technology or by taxing the use of competing technologies Market Formation is especially important in the field of sustainable energy technologies since in this case there usually is a strong normative legitimation for the intervention in market dynamics \n",
      " F6 Resource mobilization \n",
      " Resource Mobilization refers to the allocation of financial material and human capital The access to such capital factors is necessary for all other developments Typical activities involved in this system function are investments and subsidies They can also involve the deployment of generic infrastructures such as educational systems large R&D facilities or refueling infrastructures In some cases the mobilization of natural resources such as biomass oil or natural gas is important as well The Resource Mobilization function represents a basic economic variable Its importance is obvious an emerging technology cannot be supported in any way if there are no financial or natural means or if there are no actors present with the right skills and competences \n",
      " F7 Support from advocacy coalitions \n",
      " The rise of an emerging technology often leads to resistance from actors with interests in the incumbent energy system In order for a Technological Innovation System to develop other actors must counteract this inertia This can be done by urging authorities to reorganize the institutional configuration of the system The Support from Advocacy Coalitions function involves political lobbies and advice activities on behalf of interest groups This system function may be regarded as a special form of Guidance of the Search After all lobbies and advices are pleas in favor of particular technologies The essential feature which sets this category apart is that advocacy coalitions do not have the power like for example governments to change formal institutions directly Instead they employ the power of persuasion The notion of the advocacy coalition is based on the work of Sabatier who introduced the idea within the context of political science \n",
      " The concept stresses the idea that structural change within a system is the outcome of competing interest groups each representing a separate system of values and ideas The outcome is determined by political power \n",
      " Cumulative causation \n",
      " Since Carlsson and Stankiewicz introduced the concept of a Technological Innovation System an increasing number of scholars have started focusing on dynamics A recurring theme within their studies has been the notion of cumulative causation closely related to the idea of a \n",
      " virtuous circle \n",
      " or \n",
      " vicious circle \n",
      " by \n",
      " Gunnar Myrdal \n",
      " In this context cumulative causation is the phenomenon that the build-up of a Technological Innovation System accelerates due to system functions interacting and reinforcing each other over time For example the successful realization of a research project contributing to Knowledge Development may result in high expectations contributing to Guidance of the Search among policy makers which may subsequently trigger the start-up of a subsidy program contributing to Resource Mobilization which induces even more research activities Knowledge Development Guidance of the Search etc System functions may also reinforce each other downwards In that case interactions result in conflicting developments or a vicious circle! Recently scholars have increasingly paid attention to the question of how cumulative causation may be established often with a particular focus on the development of sustainable energy technologies \n",
      " Acquiring new technologies and capabilities \n",
      " To improve competitiveness and retain sustainability firms require new technologies and capabilities In this age of rapid innovation and complexity it is challenging for the firms to develop internally and remain competitive at the same time Merger acquisition and alliance are some of the ways to achieve this but the primary driver is the desire to obtain valuable resources Many acquisitions failed to achieve their objectives and resulted in poor performance because of improper implementation \n",
      " Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition \n",
      " For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence \n",
      " Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing \n",
      " Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise \n",
      " Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition \n",
      " Preservation of tacit knowledge employees and literature are always delicate during and after acquisition Strategic management of all these resources is a very important factor for a successful acquisition \n",
      " Increase in acquisitions in our global business environment has pushed us to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementation It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage Retention is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence \n",

      " Communities of Innovation compared to Communities of Practice \n",
      " These are Communities that take total financial administrative and operational control over the development of their communities Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have existed for centuries The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available It provides employment improves the future prospects for all participants and their children and injects a sense of pride and achievement Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing schools and roads \n",
      " The Aga Khan Foundation is focused on reducing rural poverty particularly in resource-poor degraded or remote environments The Aga Khan Foundation created the model of participatory rural development The model of participatory rural development combines a set of common development principles with the flexibility to respond to specific contexts and needs Programmes typically link elements such as rural savings and credit natural resource management productive infrastructure development increased agricultural productivity and human skills development with a central concern for community-level participation and decision-making The ultimate goal is to enable community members to make informed choices from a range of appropriate options for sustainable and equitable development \n",

      " innovation \n",
      " by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level \n",
      " In the late 1990s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of \"constructive disruptive technology\" by working with the consultant David E O'Ryan whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called \"an unfair advantage\" The process or technology change as a whole had to be \"constructive\" in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user \n",

      " not \n",
      " \"advanced technologies\" which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect Rather they are often novel combinations of existing off-the-shelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network \n",

      " The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that \n",
      " Clayton M Christensen \n",
      " called the \"technology mudslide hypothesis\" This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn't \"keep up technologically\" with other firms In this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesn't model reality What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition In Christensen's terms a firm's existing \n",
      " value networks \n",
      " place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm Meanwhile start-up firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network At that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the \n",
      " market share \n",
      " attack with a me-too entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward \n",
      " Christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers \n",
      " \"Generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream \" \n",
      " Christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm \n",
      " Thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to \" \n",
      " focus on the customer \n",
      " \" or \"stay close to the customer\" or \"listen to the customer\" can be strategically counterproductive \n",
      " While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful well-managed companies O'Ryan countered that \"constructive\" integration of existing new and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole \n",
      " How low-end disruption occurs over time \n",
      " Christensen distinguishes between \"low-end disruption\" which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and \"new-market disruption\" which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents \n",
      " \"Low-end disruption\" occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance Therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments At this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market \n",
      " In low-end disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin To get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality To ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers After a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving And then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market \n",
      " \"New market disruption\" occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry \n",

      " Milan Zeleny \n",
      " described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted The answer according to Zeleny is the \n",
      " support network \n",
      " of high technology \n",
      " For example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners In the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network \n",

      " Regarding this evolving process of technology \n",
      " Christensen \n",
      " said \n",
      " \"The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view They do however have two important characteristics First they typically present a different package of performance attributesones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers Second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets \" \n",
      " Joseph Bower \n",
      " explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry \n",
      " \"When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive its not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins arent sufficient to cover big-company cost structure As a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of whats currently popular with the best customers But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market Once the disruptive technology becomes established there smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technologys performance on attributes that mainstream customers value \" \n",
      " The automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging TSN The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of \n",

      " Milan Zeleny \n",
      " described the above phenomenon \n",
      " He also wrote that \n",
      " \"Implementing high technology is often resisted This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines ATMs were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted Middle management resists \n",
      " business process reengineering \n",
      " because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work \" \n",
      " High-technology effects \n",
      " High technology \n",
      " is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the \n",
      " technology support net \n",
      " High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows It also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordinationthe organizational culture itself \n",
      " This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently It is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance \n",
      " As for the difference between high technology and low technology Milan Zeleny once said \n",
      " \" The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful For example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor Therein lies the management challenge of high technology \" \n",
      " However not all modern technologies are high technologies They have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite TSNs They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge Not all information technologies have integrative effects Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN The administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers \n",
      " As knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind super-book or super-database but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action \n",
