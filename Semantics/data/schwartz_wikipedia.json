behaviour of people The term \" \n authority \n \" is often used for power perceived as \n legitimate \n by the \n social structure \n Power can be seen as evil or \n unjust \n but the exercise of power is accepted as \n endemic \n to humans as social beings In \n business \n power is often expressed as being \"upward\" or \"downward\" With downward power a company's superior influences subordinates When a company exerts upward power it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of their leader or leaders \n The use of power need not involve force or the threat of force \n coercion \n At one extreme it closely resembles what an English-speaking person might term \"influence\" although some authors distinguish \"influence\" as a means by which power is used \n One such example is \n soft power \n as compared to \n hard power \n Much of the recent \n sociological \n debate about power revolves around the issue of its means to enable in other words power as a means to make \n social actions \n possible as much as it may constrain or prevent them The philosopher \n Michel Foucault \n saw power as a \n structural \n expression of \"a complex strategic situation in a given \n social setting \n \" \n that requires both constraint and enablement \n Theories \n Five bases \n Legitimate power \n Referent power \n Expert power \n Reward power \n Coercive power \n

literacy \n Quotations \n Theories \n Five bases \n French and Raven's five bases of power \n Social psychologists \n John R P French \n and \n Bertram Raven \n in a now-classic study \n developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work or fail to work in a specific relationship \n According to French and Raven power must be distinguished from influence in the following way power is that state of affairs which holds in a given relationship A-B such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely Conceived this way power is fundamentally \n relative \n it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship and interestingly requires B's recognition of a quality in A which would motivate B to change in the way A intends A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship to effect the desired outcome Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects including a reduction in A's own power \n French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities while not excluding other minor categories Further bases have since been adduced in particular by \n Gareth Morgan \n in his book \n Images of Organization \n Legitimate power \n Legitimate power \n Also called \"positional power \" it is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power such as a \n uniform \n a title or an imposing physical office \n Referent power \n Referent power \n Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build \n loyalty \n It is based on the \n charisma \n and \n interpersonal skills \n of the power holder A person may be admired because of specific personal trait and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence Here the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower \n Nationalism \n and \n patriotism \n count towards an intangible sort of referent power For example soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country This is the second least obvious power but the most effective Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for products endorsements for example The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena \n Abuse is possible when someone that is likable yet lacks integrity and honesty rises to power placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position Referent power is unstable alone and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect When combined with other sources of power however it can help a person achieve great success \n Expert power \n Expert power \n Expert \n power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise Unlike the others this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation suggest solutions use solid judgment and generally out perform others then people tend to listen to them When individuals demonstrate expertise people tend to trust them and respect what they say As subject matter experts their ideas will have more value and others will look to them for \n leadership \n in that area \n Reward power \n Reward power \n Reward \n power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind such as benefits time off desired gifts promotions or increases in pay or responsibility This power is obvious but also ineffective if abused People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or 'moving things too quickly' If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants there's a high probability that they'll do it The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases and managers often can't control promotions all by themselves And even a CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions So when somebody uses up available rewards or the rewards don't have enough perceived value to others their power weakens One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they're to have the same motivational impact Even then if rewards are given frequently people can become satiated by the reward such that it loses its effectiveness \n Coercive power \n Coercive power \n Coercive control \n Coercive \n power is the application of negative influences It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it Threats and \n punishment \n are common tools of coercion Implying or threatening that someone will be fired demoted denied privileges or given undesirable assignments these are examples of using coercive power Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold impoverished style of leadership \n Principles in interpersonal relationships \n According to Guerrero Laura K and Peter A Andersen in \"Close encounters Communication in Relationships\" \n Power as a Perception Power is a perception in a sense that some people can have objective power but still have trouble influencing others People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others Some people become influential even though they don't overtly use powerful behavior \n Power as a Relational Concept Power exists in relationships The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one's partner Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas \n Power as Resource Based Power usually represents a struggle over resources The more scarce and valued resources are the more intense and protracted are power struggles The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand However scarce resource leads to power only if it's valued within a relationship \n The Principle of Least Interest and Dependence Power The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them According to interdependence theory quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship The \n principle of least interest \n suggests that if a difference exists in the intensity of positive feelings between partners the partner who feels the most positive is at a power disadvantage There's an inverse relationship between interest in relationship and the degree of relational power \n Power as \n Enabling \n or Disabling Power can be enabling or disabling Research has been shown that people are more likely to have an enduring influence on others when they engage in dominant behavior that reflects \n social skill \n rather than \n intimidation \n Personal power is protective against pressure and excessive \n influence \n by others and/or situational stress People who communicate through self-confidence and expressive composed behavior tend to be successful in achieving their goals and maintaining good relationships Power can be disabling when it leads to destructive patterns of communication This can lead to the chilling effect where the less powerful person often hesitates to communicate dissatisfaction and the demand withdrawal pattern which is when one person makes demands and the other becomes defensive and withdraws mawasha Both effects have negative consequences for relational satisfaction \n Power as a Prerogative The prerogative principle states that the partner with more power can make and break the rules Powerful people can violate norms break relational rules and manage interactions without as much penalty as powerless people These actions may reinforce the powerful person's dependence power In addition the more powerful person has the prerogative to manage both verbal and nonverbal interactions They can initiate conversations change topics interrupt others initiate touch and end discussions more easily than less powerful people See \n expressions of dominance \n Rational choice framework \n Game theory \n with its foundations in the \n Walrasian \n theory of \n rational choice \n is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships One rational choice definition of power is given by \n Keith Dowding \n in his book \n Power \n In rational choice theory human individuals or groups can be modelled as 'actors' who choose from a 'choice set' of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes An actor's 'incentive structure' comprises its beliefs about the costs associated with different actions in the choice set and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes \n In this setting we can differentiate between \n outcome power \n the ability of an actor to bring about or help bring about outcomes \n social power \n the ability of an actor to change the incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes \n This framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others For example a 'powerful' actor can take options away from another's choice set can change the relative costs of actions can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome or might simply change the other's beliefs about its incentive structure \n As with other models of power this framework is neutral as to the use of 'coercion' For example a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions so can a financial penalty in a 'voluntarily agreed' contract or indeed a friendly offer \n Cultural hegemony \n In the \n Marxist \n tradition the \n Italian \n writer \n Antonio Gramsci \n elaborated the role of \n ideology \n in creating a \n cultural hegemony \n which becomes a means of bolstering the power of \n capitalism \n and of the \n nation-state \n Drawing on \n Niccol Machiavelli \n in \n The Prince \n and trying to understand why there had been no \n Communist \n revolution in \n Western Europe \n while it was claimed there had been one in \n Russia \n Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a \n centaur \n consisting of two halves The back end the beast represented the more classic material image of power power through coercion through brute force be it physical or economic But the capitalist hegemony he argued depended even more strongly on the front end the human face which projected power through 'consent' In Russia this power was lacking allowing for a revolution However in Western Europe specifically in \n Italy \n capitalism had succeeded in exercising \n consensual \n power convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists In this way revolution had been avoided \n While Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a ' \n reserve army of labour \n ' In wartime it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks while after the war the roles are easily reversed Therefore according to Barrett the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women \n Tarnow \n Tarnow \n considers what power hijackers have over air plane passengers and draws similarities with power in the military He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group If the group conforms to the leader's commands the leader's power over an individual is greatly enhanced while if the group does not conform the leader's power over an individual is nil \n Foucault \n For \n Michel Foucault \n real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents with the discovery and emergence of \n Biopower \n and \n Biopolitics \n a biological and political technology of its population highlights this fact No single human group nor single actor runs the dispositif machine or apparatus but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible ensuring its agents do whatever is necessary It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected so remains elusive to 'rational' investigation according to Foucault Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist \n Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon \n entitled \n Recherches et considrations sur la population de la France \n but however turns out to be written by his secretary \n Jean-Baptise Moheau \n and by emphasizing \n Biologist \n Jean-Baptiste Lamarck \n who constantly refers to \n Milieus \n as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water air and light confirming the genus within the milieu in this case the human species relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu This milieu both artificial and natural appears as a target of intervention for power according to Foucault which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty territory and disciplinary space inter woven into from a social and political relations which function as a species biological species \n Clegg \n Stewart Clegg \n proposes another three-dimensional model with his \"circuits of power\" \n theory This model likens the production and organizing of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits episodic dispositional and facilitative These circuits operate at three levels two are macro and one is micro The \n episodic circuit \n is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings communication conflict and resistance in day-to-day interrelations The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative The \n dispositional circuit \n is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority The \n facilitative circuit \n is constituted of macro level technology environmental contingencies job design and networks which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward agency in the episodic circuit All three independent circuits interact at \"obligatory passage points\" which are channels for \n empowerment \n or disempowerment \n Galbraith \n JK Galbraith \n summarizes the types of power as being \"condign\" based on force \"compensatory\" through the use of various resources or \"conditioned\" the result of \n persuasion \n and their sources as \"personality\" individuals \"property\" their material resources and \"organizational\" whoever sits at the top of an organisational power structure \n Gene Sharp \n Gene Sharp \n an American professor of political science believes that power depends ultimately on its bases Thus a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates laws and policies Sharp cites the insight of \n tienne de La Botie \n Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic that is it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power For Sharp political power the power of any state regardless of its particular structural organization ultimately derives from the subjects of the state His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler s If subjects do not obey leaders have no power \n His work is thought to have been influential in the overthrow of \n Slobodan Milosevic \n in the \n Arab Spring \n and other \n nonviolent \n revolutions \n Bjrn Kraus \n Bjrn Kraus \n deals with the \n epistemological \n perspective upon power regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of \n constructivism \n named \n relational constructivism \n Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all \n Coming from \n Max Weber \n 's definition of power \n he realizes that the term of power has to be split into \"instructive power\" and \"destructive power\" \n More precisely instructive power means the chance to determine the actions and thoughts of another person whereas destructive power means the chance to diminish the opportunities of another person \n How significant this distinction really is becomes evident by looking at the possibilities of rejecting power attempts Rejecting instructive power is possible rejecting destructive power is not By using this distinction proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility \n f \n This perspective permits to get over an \"either-or-position\" either there is power or there isn't which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories \n and to introduce the possibility of an \"as well as-position\" \n Unmarked categories \n The idea of \n unmarked categories \n originated in \n feminism \n The theory analyzes the culture of the powerful The powerful comprise those people in society with easy access to resources those who can exercise power without considering their actions For the powerful their culture seems obvious for the powerless on the other hand it remains out of reach lite and expensive \n The \n unmarked category \n can form the identifying mark of the powerful The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else For most Western readers it is posited that if a protagonist's \n race \n is not indicated it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is \n Caucasian \n if a sexual identity is not indicated it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is \n heterosexual \n if the gender of a body is not indicated will be assumed by the reader that it is \n male \n if a disability is not indicated it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is able bodied just as a set of examples \n One can often overlook unmarked categories Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful as they often fall within this category The unmarked category becomes the norm with the other categories relegated to deviant status Social groups can apply this view of power to race \n gender \n and \n disability \n without modification the able body is the neutral body \n Counterpower \n The term 'counter-power' sometimes written 'counterpower' is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as 'a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias' \n Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as 'anti-power' and 'when institutions of counter-power maintain themselves in the face of the state this is usually referred to as a 'dual power' situation' \n Tim Gee \n in his book \n Counterpower Making Change Happen \n put forward a theory that those disempowered by governments' and elite groups' power can use \n counterpower \n to counter this \n In Gee's model \n counterpower \n is split into three categories \n idea counterpower \n economic counterpower \n and \n physical counterpower \n Although the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/ \n anti-globalization movement \n of the 1990s onwards \n the word has been used for at least years for instance \n Martin Buber \n 's book 'Paths in Utopia' includes the line 'Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power' \n Other theories \n Thomas Hobbes \n defined power as a man's \"present means to obtain some future apparent good\" \n Leviathan \n Ch \n The thought of \n Friedrich Nietzsche \n underlies much 20th century analysis of power Nietzsche disseminated ideas on the \" \n will to power \n \" which he saw as the domination of other humans as much as the exercise of control over one's environment \n Some schools of \n psychology \n notably that associated with \n Alfred Adler \n place power dynamics at the core of their theory where orthodox \n Freudians \n might place \n sexuality \n Psychological research \n Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has the less one takes on the perspective of others implying that the powerful have less \n empathy \n Adam Galinsky \n along with several coauthors found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead they are times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power \n Powerful people are also more likely to take action In one example powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people Researchers have documented the \n bystander effect \n they found that powerful people are three times as likely to first offer help to a \"stranger in distress\" \n A study involving over college students suggested that those primed to feel powerful through stating 'power words' were less susceptible to external pressure more willing to give honest feedback and more creative \n Empathy gap \n Empathy gap \n \" \n Power is defined as a possibility to influence others \n \" \n The use of power has evolved from centuries \n citation needed \n Gaining prestige honor and reputation is one of the central motives for gaining power in human nature \n citation needed \n Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the power differences Having power or not having power can cause a number of psychological consequences It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities \n citation needed \n Research experiments were done \n by whom? \n as early as to explore power conflict \n Past research \n Earlier \n when? \n research proposed that increased power relates to increased rewards and leads one to approach things more frequently \n citation needed \n In contrast decreased power relates to more constraint threat and punishment which leads to inhibitions It was concluded \n by whom? \n that being powerful leads one to successful outcomes to develop negotiation strategies and to make more self-serving offers \n citation needed \n Later \n when? \n research proposed that differences in power lead to strategic considerations Being strategic can also mean to defend when one is opposed or to hurt the decision-maker It was concluded \n by whom? \n that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility \n Bargaining games \n Bargaining games were explored \n by whom? \n in and These studies compared behavior done in different power given \n clarification needed \n situations \n In an \n ultimatum game \n the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward \n In a \n dictator game \n the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer \n Conclusion \n The dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game \n Self-serving \n also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed \n When the counterpart recipient is completely powerless lack of strategy social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given the one with the power \n Abusive power and control \n Abusive power and control \n Coercive power \n Abusive power and control or controlling behaviour or coercive control is the way that abusers gain and maintain power and control over a victim for an \n abusive \n purpose such as \n psychological \n physical \n sexual \n or \n financial \n abuse The abuse can be for various reasons such as personal gain personal \n gratification \n psychological projection \n devaluation \n envy \n or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control \n Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive Control may be helped through \n economic abuse \n thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse \n The goal of the abuser is to control and \n intimidate \n the victim or to \n influence \n them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship \n Manipulators \n and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics including \n positive reinforcement \n such as \n praise \n flattery \n ingratiation \n love bombing \n smiling \n gifts \n attention \n negative reinforcement \n intermittent or partial reinforcement \n psychological punishment \n such as \n nagging \n silent treatment \n swearing \n threats \n intimidation \n emotional blackmail \n guilt trips \n inattention and traumatic tactics such as \n verbal abuse \n or \n explosive anger \n The \n vulnerabilities \n of the victim are exploited with those who are particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets \n Traumatic bonding \n can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing \n cycles of abuse \n in which the intermittent reinforcement of \n reward \n and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a \n climate of fear \n An attempt may be made to \n normalise \n legitimise \n rationalise \n deny \n or \n minimise \n the abusive behaviour or \n blame the victim \n for it \n Isolation \n gaslighting \n mind games \n and \n divide and rule \n are other strategies that are often used The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs to help \n disorientate \n them \n Certain personality types feel particularly compelled to control other people \n Tactics \n In everyday situations people use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt people into particular action There are plenty of examples of power tactics that are quite common and employed every day Some of these tactics include \n bullying \n collaboration complaining criticizing demanding disengaging evading humor inspiring \n manipulating \n negotiating socializing and supplicating These power tactics can be classified along three different dimensions \n Soft \n and \n hard \n Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between person and the target They are more indirect and interpersonal e g collaboration socializing Conversely hard tactics are harsh forceful direct and rely on concrete outcomes However they are not more powerful than soft tactics In many circumstances fear of \n social exclusion \n can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment \n Rational and nonrational \n Rational tactics of influence make use of reasoning logic and sound judgment whereas nonrational tactics rely on emotionality and misinformation Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion and evasion and put downs respectively \n Unilateral and bilateral \n Bilateral tactics such as collaboration and negotiation involve reciprocity on the part of both the person influencing and their target Unilateral tactics on the other hand are enacted without any participation on the part of the target These tactics include disengagement and \n fait accompli \n People tend to vary in their use of power tactics with different types of people opting for different tactics For instance interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics \n Machiavellians \n however tend to use nonrational tactics Moreover extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts \n People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation and based on whom they are trying to influence People also tend to shift from soft to hard tactics when they face resistance \n Balance of power \n Because power operates both relationally and reciprocally \n sociologists \n speak of the balance of power between parties to a \n relationship \n all parties to all relationships have \n some \n power the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths equal or unequal stable or subject to periodic change Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of \n constraint \n rather than of power Thus 'power' has a connotation of unilateralism If this were not so then all relationships could be described in terms of 'power' and its meaning would be lost Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others to acquire power you must possess or control a form of power currency \n Effects \n Power changes those in the position of power and those who are targets of that power \n Approach/inhibition theory \n Developed by D Keltner and colleagues \n approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways The reaction of \n approach \n is associated with action self-promotion seeking rewards increased energy and movement \n Inhibition \n on the contrary is associated with self-protection avoiding threats or danger vigilance loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity \n Overall approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies while reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies \n Positive \n Power prompts people to take action \n Makes individuals more responsive to changes within a group and its environment \n Powerful people are more proactive more likely to speak up make the first move and lead negotiation \n Powerful people are more focused on the goals appropriate in a given situation and tend to plan more task-related activities in a work setting \n Powerful people tend to experience more positive emotions such as happiness and satisfaction and they smile more than low-power individuals \n Power is associated with optimism about the future because more powerful individuals focus their attention on more positive aspects of the environment \n People with more power tend to carry out executive cognitive functions more rapidly and successfully including internal control mechanisms that coordinate attention decision-making planning and goal-selection \n Negative \n Powerful people are prone to take risky inappropriate or unethical decisions and often overstep their \n boundaries \n They tend to generate negative emotional reactions in their subordinates particularly when there is a conflict in the group \n When individuals gain power their self-evaluation become more positive while their evaluations of others become more negative \n Power tends to weaken ones social attentiveness which leads to difficulty understanding other peoples point of view \n Powerful people also spend less time collecting and processing information about their subordinates and often perceive them in a stereotypical fashion \n People with power tend to use more coercive tactics increase social distance between themselves and subordinates believe that non-powerful individuals are untrustworthy and devalue work and ability of less powerful individuals \n Reactions \n Tactics \n A number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics e g punishment both personal and impersonal rule-based sanctions and non-personal rewards are less effective than soft tactics expert power referent power and personal rewards \n It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility depression fear and anger while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation \n Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work while instilling a feeling of autonomy in ones subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring \n Coercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group This effect is called \n Disruptive contagion or ripple effect \n and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group and authoritys requests are vague and ambiguous \n Resistance to coercive influence \n Coercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful \n the leader is trusted and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms \n Furthermore coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions \n However in some cases group members chose to resist the authoritys influence When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity they are more likely to form a \n Revolutionary Coalition \n a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the groups authority structure \n Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power uses coercive methods and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments It is because these conditions create \n reactance \n a complex emotional and cognitive reaction that occurs when individuals feel that their freedom to make choices has been threatened or eliminated When reactance occurs individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their authority \n Kelman's compliance-identification-internalization theory of conversion \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three basic step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence \n compliance \n identification \n and \n internalization \n This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time \n At the stage of \n compliance \n group members comply with authoritys demands but personally do not agree with them If authority does not monitor the members they will probably not obey \n Identification \n occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority mimics authoritys actions values characteristics and takes on behaviours of the person with power If prolonged and continuous identification can lead to the final stage internalization \n When \n internalization \n occurs individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system At this stage group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions

{"theme.id": 2, "title": "Need for achievement", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_achievement", "depth": 0, "text": "Need for achievement \n Need for achievement \n N-Ach \n refers to an individual's desire for significant accomplishment mastering of skills control or high standards The term was first used by \n Henry Murray \n and associated with a range of actions These include \"intense prolonged and repeated efforts to accomplish something difficult To work with singleness of purpose towards a high and distant \n goal \n To have the determination to win\" The concept of N-Ach was subsequently popularised by the psychologist \n David McClelland \n This personality trait is characterized by an enduring and consistent concern with setting and meeting high standards of achievement This need is influenced by internal drive for action intrinsic motivation and the pressure exerted by the expectations of others extrinsic motivation Measured with the \n thematic apperception test \n TAT need for achievement motivates an individual to succeed in competition and to excel in activities important to him or her \n Need for Achievement is related to the difficulty of tasks people choose to undertake Those with low N-Ach may choose very easy tasks in order to minimise risk of failure or highly difficult tasks such that a failure would not be embarrassing Those with high N-Ach tend to choose moderately difficult tasks feeling that they are challenging but within reach \n People high in N-Ach are characterised by a tendency to seek challenges and a high degree of independence Their most satisfying reward is the recognition of their achievements Sources of high N-Ach include \n Parents who encouraged independence in \n childhood \n Praise and rewards for success \n Association of achievement with positive feelings \n Association of achievement with one's own competence and effort not luck \n A desire to be effective or challenged \n Intrapersonal Strength \n Desirability \n Feasibility \n Goal Setting Abilities \n In the work place organizations can find it hard to recognize those who are high in the N-Ach and those who are not When people who need and require the necessary attention for their efforts to be recognized by someone who is in an influential position to them if they do not receive the satisfaction or recognition they may become dissatisfied and frustrated with their work or position This can lead to a myriad of problems in job and self-resentment and disapproval \n This can be seen as a negative emotional reaction however in turn as we learned from David McClelland the need for achievement will take its course in different ways A person will either take small easy tasks that they know the can accomplish and be congratulated for or they will accept extremely challenging tasks for they fear not risk of embarrassment in failure due to the high demand of the procured undertaking It has been found that employees motivated by the need for achievement are typically more of the risk takers in the organization They are also the employees that want to constantly be challenged to learn new things \n These people tend to become very absorbed in their work This is why they require recognition when a task is completed \n So If a risk taker becomes dissatisfied due to the lack or appreciation for their work they teeter back and forth on the edge of a knife On either side is an enormous plunge and it can go either way The employee will either continue to work and take more risks and be creative and try harder to impress and gain recognition Or they will go find somewhere else to work In this manner employers managers colleagues and co-workers need to respect everyone who has a need for achievement personality and give them the credit they require to keep them happy This will lead to a productive happy and well established work force Here are some road blocks that those who have a high need for achievement David McClelland suggested other characteristics and attitudes of achievement-motivated people \n Achievement is more important than material or financial reward \n Achieving the aim or task gives greater personal satisfaction than receiving praise or recognition \n Financial reward is regarded as a measurement of success not an end in itself \n Security is not prime motivator nor is status \n Feedback is essential because it enables measurement of success not for reasons of praise or recognition the implication here is that feedback must be reliable quantifiable and factual \n Achievement-motivated people constantly seek improvements and ways of doing things better \n Theory \n Measurement \n Further reading \n Theory \n The pioneering research work of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the 1930s summarized in \n Explorations in Personality \n provided the start point for future studies of personality especially those relating to needs and motives \n David C McClelland's \n and his associates' investigations of achievement motivation have particular relevance to the emergence of leadership McClelland was interested in the possibility of deliberately arousing a motive to achieve in an attempt to explain how individuals express their preferences for particular outcomesa general problem of motivation In this connection the need for achievement refers to an individual's preference for success under conditions of competition The vehicle \n McClelland \n employed to establish the presence of an achievement motive was the type of fantasy a person expressed on the \n Thematic Apperception Test \n TAT developed by Christiana Morgan and Henry Murray who note in \n Explorations in Personality \n that \" when a person interprets an ambiguous social situation he is apt to expose his own personality as much as the phenomenon to which he is attending Each picture should suggest some critical situation and be effective in evoking a fantasy relating to it\" p531 The test is composed of a series of pictures that subjects are asked to interpret and describe to the psychologist The TAT has been widely used to support assessment of needs and motives \n In McClelland published The Achieving Society which articulated his model of human motivation McClelland contended that three dominant needs -for achievement for power and for affiliation- underpin human motivation McClelland believed that the relative importance of each need varies among individuals and cultures Arguing that commonly used hiring tests using IQ and personality assessments were poor predictors of competency McClelland proposed that companies should base hiring decisions on demonstrated competency in relevant fields rather than on standardized test scores Iconoclastic in their time McClellands ideas have become standard practice in many corporations \n The procedure in McClelland's initial investigation was to arouse in the test audience a concern with their achievement A control group was used in which arousal was omitted In the course of this experiment McClelland discovered through analyzing the stories on the TAT that initial arousal was not necessary Instead members of the control group individuals who had had no prior arousal demonstrated significant differences in their stories some writing stories with a high achievement content and some submitting stories with a low achievement content Using results based on the \n Thematic Apperception Test \n McClelland demonstrated that individuals in a society can be grouped into high achievers and low achievers based on their scores on what he called \"N-Ach\" \n McClelland \n and his associates have since extended their work in fantasy analysis to include different age groups occupational groups and nationalities in their investigations of the strength of need for achievement These investigations have indicated that the N-Ach score increases with a rise in occupational level Invariably businessmen managers and entrepreneurs are high scorers Other investigations into the characteristics of the high achievers have revealed that accomplishment on the job represents an end in itself monetary rewards serve as an index of this accomplishment In addition these other studies found that the high achievers though identified as managers businessmen and entrepreneurs are not gamblers A high emotional intelligence calls for a high need for achievement while a low emotional intelligence calls for a lower need for achievement They will accept risk only to the degree they believe their personal contributions will make a difference in the final outcome \n An experiment realized to entry level managers of AT&T from to studied the level of achievement attained during a period of to years showing that High n-Achievement was associated with managerial success at lower levels of management jobs in which promotion depends more on individual contributions than it does at higher levels At the higher levels in which promotion depends on demonstrated ability to manage others a high n-Achievement is not associated with success by contrast the leadership motive pattern is so associated in all likelihood because it involves a high n-Power emerging as a concern for influencing people \n These explorations into the achievement motive seem to turn naturally into the investigation of national differences based on Max Weber's thesis that the industrialization and economic development of the Western nations were related to the Protestant ethic and its corresponding values supporting work and achievement McClelland and his associates have satisfied themselves that such a relationship viewed historically through an index of national power consumption indeed exists Differences related to individual as well as to national accomplishments depend on the presence or absence of an achievement motive in addition to economic resources or the infusion of financial assistance High achievers can be viewed as satisfying a need for self-actualization through accomplishments in their job assignments as a result of their particular knowledge their particular experiences and the particular environments in which they have lived \n Measurement \n The techniques McClelland and his collaborators developed to measure N-Ach \n N-Affil \n and \n N-Pow \n see McClelland et al can be viewed as a radical break with the dominant \n psychometric \n tradition However it should be recognized that McClelland's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of \n Henry Murray \n both in terms of Murray's model of human needs and motivational processes and his work with the OSS during World War Two It was during this period that Murray introduced the idea of \"situation tests\" and multi-rater / multi-method assessments It was Murray who first identified the significance of Need for Achievement Power and Affiliation and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model \n Whilst trait-based personality theory assume that high-level competencies like initiative creativity and leadership can be assessed using \"internally consistent\" measures see \n psychometrics \n the McClelland measures recognize that such competencies are difficult and demanding activities which will neither be developed nor displayed unless people are undertaking activities they care about i e are strongly motivated to undertake Furthermore it is the cumulative number of independent but cumulative and substitutable components of competence they bring to bear while seeking to carry out these activities that will determine their success Accordingly the N-Ach N-Aff and N-Pow scoring systems simply count how many components of competence people bring to bear whilst carrying out activities they have a strong personal inclination or motivation to undertake \n McClellands research led him to formulate psychological characteristics of persons with strong need for achievement According to McClelland and David Winter \n Motivating Economic Achievement \n the following features accompany high level of achievement motivation \n Moderate risk propensity \n Undertaking innovative and engaging tasks \n Internal locus of control and responsibility for own decisions and behaviors \n Need for precise goal setting \n An important corollary is that there is no point in trying to assess people's abilities without first finding out what they care about So one cannot as some psychometricians try to do assess such things as \"creativity\" in any general sense One has always to ask \"creativity in relation to what?\" So McClelland's measures originally presented as means of assessing \"personality\" are best understood as means of measuring \n competence \n in ways which break radically with traditional \n psychometric \n approaches Everybody has different goals and needs for achievement based off many factors like past experiences education the risks and the feedback they will receive \n Need theory \n Need for power \n Need for affiliation \n Need for cognition \n Goal orientation"},

advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic \n Within this universal view the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bah' Faith \n The \n Bah' teachings \n state that since all humans have been created in the image of God God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race colour or religion \n Thus because all humans have been created equal they all require equal opportunities and treatment \n Thus the Bah' view promotes the unity of humanity and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation \n The teaching however does not equal unity with uniformity but instead the Bah' writings advocate for the principle of \n unity in diversity \n where the variety

neo-Hinduism \n is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and \n orientalism \n It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect \n It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a \"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\" \n with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine \n For example it presents that \n an imagined \"integral unity\" that was probably little more than an \"imagined\" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality \"on the ground \" as it were throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region \n Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity \n self-published source \n This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture \n extending far beyond the \n Dashanami Sampradaya \n the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by \n Adi Shankara \n An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was \n Ram Mohan Roy \n who established the \n Brahmo Samaj \n Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by \n Vivekananda \n and \n Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan \n Veneration for all other religions was articulated by \n Gandhi \n After long study and experience I have come to the conclusion that all religions are true all religions have some error in them all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith therefore no thought of conversion is possible \n Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation regarding Vedanta to be the \"central theology of Hinduism\" \n Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a \"single world religion\" \n and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta \n citation not found \n Islam \n Further information \n Ummah \n Divisions of the world in Islam \n People of the Book \n Dhimmi \n and \n Dawah \n Islam recognizes to a

Book\" \n ahl al-kitab \n Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include \n Zoroastrians \n and later even Hindus as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews Christians and \n Sabians \n as People of the Book \n need quotation to verify \n not in citation given \n not in citation

member of the \n Muslim Brotherhood \n movement and one of the key contemporary philosophers of Islam \n There are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism According to the most inclusive teachings common among the \n liberal Muslim movements \n all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation For example Surah states that \n unreliable source? \n pageneeded \n Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians and Sabians whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve let there be no compulsion in religion \n However the most exclusive teachings opinion differently For example the \n Salafi \n refer to Surah \n citation needed \n Then when the sacred months have passed slay the idolaters \n mushrikun \n wherever ye find them and take them and besiege them and lay in wait in every stratagem of war But if they repent and establish worship and pay the \n Zakat \n then leave their way free Lo! Allah is Forgiving Merciful Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture i e people of the book as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger and follow not the Religion of Truth until they pay the \n jizya \n readily being brought low in submission \n The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought traditionalist and reform-minded and branches of Islam from the reforming \n Quranism \n and \n Ahmadiyya \n to the ultra-traditionalist \n Salafi \n as is the doctrine of abrogation \n naskh \n which is used to determine which verses take precedence based on reconstructed chronology with later verses superseding earlier ones The traditional chronology places Surah as the last or second-to-last surah revealed thus in traditional exegesis it gains a large power of abrogation and verses are held to have abrogated \n The ahadith also play a major role in this and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections generally along with the \n Muwatta Imam Malik \n Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith to the Salafi or \n ahl al-hadith \n who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence \n Traditional Islam \n views the world as bipartite consisting of the House of Islam that is where people live under the \n Islamic law \n and the House of War that is where the people do not live under Islamic law which must be proselytized \n using whatever resources available including in some traditionalist and conservative interpretations \n the use of violence as holy struggle in the path of Allah \n to either convert its inhabitants to Islam or to rule them under the Shariah cf \n dhimmi \n Judaism \n Jewish views on religious pluralism \n Noahidism \n Judaism teaches that God \n chose the Jewish people \n to be in a unique covenant with God and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the \n Torah \n with a specific missionto be a light unto the nations and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoplesrather Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as \n Noachides \n and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind \n An on-line organization the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by \n Steven Blane \n who calls himself an \"American Jewish Universalist Rabbi\" believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism stating that \"God equally chose all nations to be

opinions or behaviors are affected by others \n Social influence takes many forms and can be seen in \n conformity \n socialization \n peer pressure \n obedience \n leadership \n persuasion \n sales \n and \n marketing \n In Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three broad varieties of social influence \n Compliance \n is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private \n Identification \n is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected such as a famous celebrity \n Internalization \n is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately \n Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard described two psychological \n needs \n that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others These include our need to be right \n informational social influence \n and our need to be liked \n normative social influence \n Informational influence or \n social proof \n is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality Informational influence comes into play when people are uncertain either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement Normative influence is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others In terms of Kelman's typology normative influence leads to public compliance whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance \n Types \n Kelman's varieties \n Compliance \n Identification \n Internalization \n Conformity \n Minority influence \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n Reactance \n Obedience \n Persuasion \n Psychological manipulation \n Antecedents \n Social impact theory \n Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" \n Unanimity \n Status \n Culture \n Emotions \n Social structure \n Social networks \n Types \n Social Influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of \n social psychology \n For more information follow the main article links provided \n Kelman's varieties \n There are three processes of \n attitude change \n as defined by Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n in a paper published in the \n Journal of Conflict Resolution \n The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence for example to separate public conformity behavior from private acceptance personal belief \n Compliance \n Compliance psychology \n Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others Technically compliance is a change in \n behavior \n but not necessarily in \n attitude \n one can comply due to mere \n obedience \n or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures \n According to Kelman's paper the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence i e people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion \n Identification \n Identification psychology \n Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired \n Advertisements \n that rely upon \n celebrity \n endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon According to Kelman the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change \n Internalization \n Internalization \n Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding It is congruent with the individual's value system and according to Kelman the \"reward\" of internalization is \"the content of the new behavior\" \n Conformity \n Conformity \n Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior belief or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence \n Social psychology \n research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties \n informational conformity \n also called \n social proof \n or \"internalization\" in Kelman's terms and \n normative conformity \n \"compliance\" in Kelman's terms \n In the case of \n peer pressure \n a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do such as taking \n illegal drugs \n but which they perceive as \"necessary\" to keep a positive \n relationship \n with other people such as their \n friends \n Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others \n Conformity can be in appearance or may be more complete in nature impacting an individual both publicly and privately \n Compliance also referred to as acquiescence demonstrates a public conformity to a group majority or norm while the individual continues to privately disagree or dissent holding on to their original beliefs or to an alternative set of beliefs differing from the majority Compliance appears as conformity but there is a division between the public and the private self \n Conversion includes the private acceptance that is absent in compliance The individual's original behaviour beliefs or thinking changes to align with that of others the influencers both publicly and privately The individual has accepted the behavior belief or thinking and has internalized it making it his own Conversion may also refer to individual members of a group changing from their initial and varied opinions to adopt the opinions of others which may differ from their original opinions The resulting group position may be a hybrid of various aspects of individual initial opinions or it may be an alternative independent of the initial positions reached through consensus \n What appears to be conformity may in fact be congruence Congruence occurs when an individual's behavior belief or thinking is already aligned with that of the others and no change occurs \n In situations where conformity including compliance conversion and congruence is absent there are non-conformity processes such as independence and anti-conformity Independence also referred to as dissent involves an individual either through their actions or lack of action or through the public expression of their beliefs or thinking being aligned with their personal standards but inconsistent with those of other members of the group either all of the group or a majority Anti-conformity also referred to as counter-conformity may appear as independence but it lacks alignment with personal standards and is for the purpose of challenging the group Actions as well as stated opinions and beliefs are often diametrically opposed to that of the group norm or majority The underlying reasons for this type of behavior may be rebelliousness/obstinacy or it may be to ensure that all alternatives and view points are given due consideration \n Minority influence \n Minority influence \n Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups the level of consistency of the minority group and situational factors such as the affluence or social importance of the minority \n Minority influence most often operates through \n informational social influence \n as opposed to \n normative social influence \n because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between \n belief \n and \n behavior \n A prophecy declared as truth when it is actually false may sufficiently influence people either through fear or logical confusion so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy This term is credited to \n sociologist \n Robert K Merton \n from an article he published in \n Reactance \n Reactance psychology \n Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms This phenomenon has also been called \n anticonformity \n While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended the reactive behavior is a result of \n social pressure \n It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean \n independence \n In many studies reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence even if the influence is clearly correct \n Obedience \n Obedience human behavior \n Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure The \n Milgram experiment \n Zimbardo's \n Stanford prison experiment \n and the \n Hofling hospital experiment \n are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures \n Persuasion \n Persuasion \n Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means \n Robert Cialdini \n defined six \"weapons of influence\" \n reciprocity \n commitment \n social proof \n authority \n liking and \n scarcity \n These \"weapons of influence\" attempt to bring about conformity by directed means Persuasion can occur through \n appeals to reason \n or \n appeals to emotion \n Psychological manipulation \n Psychological manipulation \n Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or \n perception \n of others through \n abusive \n deceptive \n or underhanded tactics \n By advancing the interests of the manipulator often at another's expense such methods could be considered exploitative abusive devious and deceptive \n Social influence is not necessarily negative For example doctors can try to \n persuade \n patients to change unhealthy habits Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it and is not unduly coercive Depending on the context and motivations social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation \n Antecedents \n Many factors can affect the impact of social influence \n Social impact theory \n Social impact theory \n Social impact theory was developed by \n Bibb Latan \n in This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence \n Strength \n The importance of the influencing group to the individual \n Immediacy \n Physical and temporal proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt \n Number \n The number of people in the group \n Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" \n Robert Cialdini \n defines six \"weapons of influence\" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader \n Reciprocity \n People tend to return a favor \n Commitment \n and \n consistency \n People do not like to be self-contradictory Once they commit to an idea or behavior they are averse to changing their minds without good reason \n Social proof \n People will be more open to things that they see others doing For example seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well \n Authority \n People will tend to obey authority figures \n Liking People are more easily swayed by people they like \n Scarcity \n A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand \n Unanimity \n Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence For example in Milgram's first set of \n obedience experiments \n 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer \"maximum shocks\" to a confederate In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks two of whom were confederates once one confederate disobeyed only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks \n Status \n Appeal to authority \n Reputation \n Those perceived as \n experts \n may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise This involves \n credibility \n a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons such as perceived experience attractiveness knowledge etc Additionally pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group This phenomenon is known as \n groupthink \n Appeals to authority may especially affect norms of \n obedience \n The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous \n Milgram experiment \n demonstrate the \n power \n of perceived authority \n Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public For example a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public This is often referred to as using the \" \n bully pulpit \n \" Likewise celebrities don't usually possess any political power but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and therefore possess \n social status \n Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another A person who possesses more authority or is perceived as being more powerful than others in a group is an icon or is most \"popular\" within a group This person has the most influence over others For example in a child's school life people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children \n Culture \n Culture \n appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group \n Stanley Milgram \n found that conformity was higher in \n Norway \n than in \n France \n This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility compared to France's cultural focus on individualism Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity However a \n Asch-style study \n found that when alienated Japanese students were more susceptible to \n anticonformity \n giving answers that were \n incorrect \n even when the group had collaborated on \n correct \n answers one third of the time significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past \n While \n gender \n does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform under certain conditions \n gender roles \n do affect such a likelihood Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men But a study found that \n experimenter bias \n was involved all of the researchers were male while all of the research participants were female Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders Furthermore men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics In other words ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to \n \"social proof\" \n Emotions \n Appeal to emotion \n Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity \n In a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group \n Social structure \n Social networks \n Social network analysis \n A \n social network \n is a \n social structure \n made up of nodes representing individuals or organizations which are connected through \n ties \n also called \n edges \n connections \n or \n links \n by one or more types of interdependency such as friendship common interests or beliefs sexual relations or kinship \n Social network analysis \n uses the lens of \n network theory \n to examine \n social relationships \n Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence For example \n Christakis \n and \n Fowler \n found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity \n smoking \n drinking \n and happiness \n Identifying the extent of social influence based on large-scale observational data with a latent \n social network \n structure is pertinent to a variety of collective social phenomena including \n crime \n civil unrest \n and \n voting behavior \n in elections For example methodologies for disentangling social influence by peers from external influenceswith latent social network structures and large-scale observational datawere applied to US presidential elections \n stock markets \n and \n civil unrest \n Authority bias \n Bystander effect \n Impression management \n Judgeadvisor system \n Mind shaping \n Propaganda"},

and night make merry Let days be full of joy Dance and make music day and night These things alone are the concern of men\" which may represent the first recorded advocacy of a hedonistic \n philosophy \n Ancient Egypt \n Scenes of a harper entertaining guests at a feast were common in \n ancient Egyptian \n tombs see \n Harper's Songs \n and sometimes contained hedonistic elements

The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BC supposedly by \n Aristippus of Cyrene \n although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name \n Aristippus the Younger \n The school was so called after \n Cyrene \n the birthplace of Aristippus It was one of the earliest \n Socratic \n schools The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure which meant not just the absence of pain but positively enjoyable sensations Of these momentary pleasures especially physical ones are stronger than those of anticipation or memory They did however recognize the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from \n altruism \n citation needed \n Theodorus the Atheist \n was a latter exponent of hedonism who was a disciple of \n younger Aristippus \n while becoming well known for expounding \n atheism \n The school died out within a century and was replaced by \n Epicureanism \n The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical \n theory of knowledge \n They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth \n They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate \n sense-experiences \n for instance that I am having a sweet sensation now but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations for instance that the honey is sweet \n They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like \n All knowledge is immediate sensation These sensations are motions which are purely subjective and are painful indifferent or pleasant according as they are violent tranquil or gentle \n Further they are entirely individual and can in no way be described as constituting absolute objective knowledge Feeling therefore is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct \n Our ways of being affected are alone knowable Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure \n Cyrenaicism deduces a single universal aim for all people which is pleasure Furthermore all feeling is momentary and homogeneous It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind \n Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures being more simple and more intense were preferable \n Momentary pleasure preferably of a physical kind is the only good for humans However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them otherwise pain will result and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life \n Regard should be paid to law and custom because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others \n Likewise friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide \n Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behaviour \n Epicureanism \n Main articles \n Epicureanism \n and \n Epicurus \n Epicureanism is a system of \n philosophy \n based upon the teachings of \n Epicurus \n c \n c \n BC founded around BC Epicurus was an \n atomic \n materialist \n following in the steps of \n Democritus \n and \n Leucippus \n His \n materialism \n led him to a general stance against superstition or the idea of divine intervention Following \n Aristippus \n about whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest sustainable \"pleasure\" in the form of a state of tranquility and freedom from fear \n ataraxia \n and absence of bodily pain \n aponia \n through knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of our desires The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure as the sole intrinsic good its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from \"hedonism\" as it is commonly understood \n Epicurus \n In the Epicurean view the highest pleasure tranquility and freedom from fear was obtained by knowledge friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires such as sex and appetites verging on \n asceticism \n He argued that when eating one should not eat too richly for it could lead to dissatisfaction later such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future Likewise sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived but had a unique version of the \n Golden Rule \n It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly agreeing \"neither to harm nor be harmed\" \n and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life \n Epicureanism was originally a challenge to \n Platonism \n though later it became the main opponent of \n Stoicism \n Epicurus and his followers shunned politics After the death of Epicurus his school was headed by \n Hermarchus \n later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era such as those in \n Antiochia \n Alexandria \n Rhodes \n and \n Ercolano \n The poet \n Lucretius \n is its most known Roman proponent By the end of the Roman Empire having undergone Christian attack and repression Epicureanism had all but died out and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist \n Pierre Gassendi \n who adapted it to the Christian doctrine \n Some writings by Epicurus have survived Some scholars consider the epic poem \n On the Nature of Things \n by \n Lucretius \n to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the \n Villa of the Papyri \n at \n Herculaneum \n are Epicurean texts At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean \n Philodemus \n Yangism \n Yangism \n Yangism has been described as a form of psychological and ethical egoism The Yangist philosophers believed in the importance of maintaining self-interest through \"keeping one's nature intact protecting one's uniqueness and not letting the body be tied by other things \" Disagreeing with the Confucian virtues of li propriety ren humaneness and yi righteousness and the Legalist virtue of fa law the Yangists saw wei wo or \"everything for myself \" as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation Individual pleasure is considered desirable like in hedonism but not at the expense of the health of individual The Yangists saw individual well-being as the prime purpose of life and considered anything that hindered that well-being immoral and unnecessary \n The main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of xing or human nature a term later incorporated by Mencius into Confucianism The xing according to sinologist A C Graham is a person's \"proper course of development\" in life Individuals can only rationally care for their own xing and should not naively have to support the xing of other people even if it means opposing the emperor In this sense Yangism is a \"direct attack\" on Confucianism by implying that the power of the emperor defended in Confucianism is baseless and destructive and that state intervention is morally flawed \n The Confucian philosopher Mencius depicts Yangism as the direct opposite of Mohism while Mohism promotes the idea of universal love and impartial caring the Yangists acted only \"for themselves \" rejecting the altruism of Mohism He criticized the Yangists as selfish ignoring the duty of serving the public and caring only for personal concerns Mencius saw Confucianism as the \"Middle Way\" between Mohism and Yangism \n Judaism \n Judaism \n believes that mankind was created for pleasure as \n God \n placed \n Adam and Eve \n in the \n Garden of Eden \n Eden being the Hebrew word for \"pleasure \" In recent years Rabbi \n Noah Weinberg \n articulated five different \n levels of pleasure \n connecting with God is the highest possible pleasure \n Christian hedonism \n Christian hedonism \n Christian doctrine \n current in some \n evangelical \n circles particularly those of the \n Reformed \n tradition \n The term was first coined by \n Reformed Baptist \n theologian \n John Piper \n in his book \n Desiring God \n My shortest summary of it is God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him Or The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever Does Christian Hedonism make a god out of pleasure?

so it was not just the number of pleasures but their intensity and how long they lasted that must be taken into account \n Other proponents like Mill argue a qualitative approach Mill believed that there can be different levels of pleasure - higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure Mill also argues that simpler beings he often refers to pigs have an easier access to the simpler pleasures since they do not see other aspects of life they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures The more elaborate beings tend to spend more thought on other matters and hence lessen the time for simple pleasure It is therefore more difficult for them to indulge in such \"simple pleasures\" in the same manner \n Contemporary approaches \n Contemporary proponents of hedonism include \n Swedish \n philosopher \n Torbjrn Tnnsj \n Fred Feldman \n and Spanish ethic philosopher \n Esperanza Guisn \n published a \"Hedonist manifesto\" in \n Michel Onfray \n Michel Onfray \n Michel Onfray contemporary hedonist philosopher \n A dedicated contemporary hedonist philosopher and writer on the history of hedonistic thought is the French \n Michel Onfray \n He has written two books directly on the subject \n L'invention du plaisir fragments cyraniques \n and \n La puissance d'exister Manifeste hdoniste \n He defines hedonism \"as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others without harming yourself or anyone else \" \n Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism a joyous \n utilitarianism \n and a generalized \n aesthetic \n of sensual \n materialism \n that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent -- while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art politics and everyday life and decisions \" \n Onfray's works \"have explored the philosophical resonances and components of and challenges to science painting gastronomy sex and sensuality bioethics wine and writing His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume Counter-history of Philosophy \" \n of which three have been published For him \"In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other Obtaining this balance my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others presumes that we approach the subject from different angles political ethical aesthetic erotic bioethical pedagogical historiographical \" \n For this he has \"written books on each of these facets of the same world view \" \n His philosophy aims for \"micro-revolutions\" or \"revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic libertarian values \" \n Abolitionism \n David Pearce philosopher \n David Pearce transhumanist philosopher \n The \n Abolitionist Society \n is a \n transhumanist \n group calling for the abolition of \n suffering \n in all sentient life through the use of advanced \n biotechnology \n Their core philosophy is \n negative utilitarianism \n David Pearce \n is a theorist of this perspective and he believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of \n suffering \n in all \n sentient \n life His book-length internet manifesto \n The Hedonistic Imperative \n outlines how \n technologies \n such as \n genetic engineering \n nanotechnology \n pharmacology \n and \n neurosurgery \n could potentially \n converge \n to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals replacing suffering with gradients of well-being a project he refers to as \" \n paradise engineering \n \" \n A \n transhumanist \n and a \n vegan \n Pearce believes that we or our future posthuman descendants have a responsibility not only to avoid \n cruelty to animals \n within human society but also to alleviate the suffering of animals in the wild \n In a talk David Pearce gave at the \n Future of Humanity Institute \n and at the \n Charity International \n 'Happiness Conference' he said \"Sadly what \n won't \n abolish suffering or at least not on its own is socio-economic reform or exponential economic growth or technological progress in the usual sense or any of the traditional panaceas for solving the world's ills Improving the external environment is admirable and important but such improvement can't recalibrate our hedonic treadmill above a genetically constrained ceiling Twin studies confirm there is a partially heritable set-point of well-being -

of \n liberty \n A person has the freedom to do things that will not in theory or in practice be prevented by other forces Outside of the human realm freedom generally does not have this political or

regard the mind as thinking only the thoughts that a purely deterministic brain happens to be engaged in at the time \n Social freedom or liberty \n Four Freedoms \n a series of paintings meant to describe the freedoms for which allied nations fought in World War II \n Main articles \n Political freedom \n and \n Liberty \n In political discourse \n political freedom \n is often associated with \n liberty \n and \n autonomy \n in the sense of \"giving oneself one's own laws\" and with having \n rights \n and the \n civil liberties \n with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include \n freedom of assembly \n freedom of association \n freedom of choice \n and \n freedom of speech \n In some circumstances particularly when discussion is limited to political freedoms the terms \"freedom\" and \"liberty\" tend to be used interchangeably \n Elsewhere however subtle distinctions between freedom and liberty have been noted \n JohnStuartMill \n differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily if not exclusively the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved As such the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others \n Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains the differences in terms of their relation to institutions \n Liberty is linked to human subjectivity freedom is not The Declaration of Independence for example describes men as having liberty and the nation as being free Free will \n the quality of being free from the control of fate or necessity \n may first have been attributed to human will but \n Newtonian physics \n attributes freedom \n degrees of freedom \n free bodies \n to objects \n Freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline Liberty like discipline is linked to institutions and political parties whether liberal or libertarian freedom is not Although freedom can work for or against institutions it is not bound to themit travels through unofficial networks To have liberty is to be liberated from something to be free is to be self-determining autonomous Freedom can or cannot exist within a state of liberty one can be liberated yet \n unfree \n or \n free \n yet enslaved Orlando Patterson has argued in \n Freedom Freedom in the Making of Western Culture \n that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves \n Another distinction that some political theorists have deemed important is that people may aspire to have freedom \n from \n limiting forces such as \n freedom from fear \n freedom from want \n and \n freedom from discrimination \n but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty \n from \n anything \n To the contrary the concept of \n negative liberty \n refers to the liberty one person may have to restrict the rights of others \n Other important fields in which freedom is an issue include \n economic freedom \n academic freedom \n intellectual freedom \n and \n scientific freedom \n Freedom as a physical concept \n In purely physical terms freedom is used much more broadly to describe the limits to which physical movement or other physical processes are possible This relates to the philosophical concept to the extent that people may be considered to have as much freedom as they are physically able to exercise The number of independent \n variables \n or parameters for a system is described as its number of \n degrees of freedom \n For example the movement of a vehicle along a road has two degrees of freedom to go fast or slow or to change direction by turning left or right The movement of a ship sailing on the waves has four degrees of freedom since it can also pitch nose-to-tail and roll side-to-side An aeroplane can also climb and sideslip giving it \n six degrees of freedom \n Degrees of freedom in mechanics \n describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or in case of a \n mechanism \n made of several bodies the number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism In the study of complex \n motor control \n there may be so many degrees of freedom that a given action can be achieved in different ways by combining movements with different degrees of freedom This issue is sometimes called the \n degrees of freedom problem \n Freedom in mathematical theory \n In \n mathematics \n freedom is the ability of a \n variable \n to change in value \n Some equations have many such variables This notion is formalized as the \n dimension \n of a \n manifold \n or an \n algebraic variety \n When \n degrees of freedom \n is used instead of \n dimension \n this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined Such degrees of freedom appear in many mathematical and related disciplines including \n degrees of freedom \n as used in \n physics \n and \n chemistry \n to explain dependence on \n parameters \n or the \n dimensions \n of a \n phase space \n and \n degrees of freedom in

concept of \n fair \n and \n just \n relations between the \n individual \n and \n society \n This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the \n distribution of wealth \n opportunities for personal activity and \n social privileges \n In \n Western \n as well as in older \n Asian cultures \n the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their \n societal roles \n and receive what was their due from society \n In the current global \n grassroots \n movements for social justice the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for \n social mobility \n the creation of \n safety nets \n and \n economic justice \n Social justice assigns rights and duties in the \n institutions \n of society which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation The relevant institutions often include \n taxation \n social insurance \n public health \n public school \n public services \n labour law \n and \n regulation \n of \n markets \n to ensure \n fair \n distribution of wealth \n and \n equal opportunity \n Interpretations that relate justice to a \n reciprocal relationship \n to society are mediated by differences in cultural traditions some of which emphasize the individual responsibility toward society and others the equilibrium between access to power and its responsible use \n Hence social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures such as \n Bartolom de las Casas \n in philosophical debates about differences among human beings in efforts for gender racial and \n social equality \n for advocating justice for \n migrants \n prisoners the \n environment \n and the physically and developmentally \n disabled \n While the concept of social justice can be traced through the theology of \n Augustine of Hippo \n and the philosophy of \n Thomas Paine \n the term \"social justice\" became used explicitly from the 1840s A \n Jesuit \n priest named \n Luigi Taparelli \n is typically credited with coining the term and it spread during the \n revolutions of \n with the work of \n Antonio Rosmini-Serbati \n In the late industrial revolution \n progressive \n American legal scholars began to use the term more particularly \n Louis Brandeis \n and \n Roscoe Pound \n From the early 20th century it was also embedded in \n international law \n and

ancient \n Western philosophy \n were typically centered upon the community \n Plato \n Plato \n wrote in \n The Republic \n that it would be an ideal state that \"every member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted \" \n In an article for J N V University author D R Bhandari says \"Justice is for Plato at once a part of human virtue and the bond which joins man together in society It is the identical quality that makes good and social Justice is an order and duty of the parts of the soul it is to the soul as health is to the body Plato says that justice is not mere strength but it is a harmonious strength Justice is not the right of the stronger but the effective harmony of the whole All moral conceptions revolve about the good of the whole-individual as well as social\" \n Aristotle \n Aristotle \n believed rights existed only between free people and the law should take \"account in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality \" Reflecting this time when \n slavery \n and subjugation of women was typical ancient views of justice tended to reflect the rigid class systems that still prevailed On the other hand for the privileged groups strong concepts of fairness and the community existed \n Distributive justice \n was said by \n Aristotle \n to require that people were distributed goods and assets according to their merit \n Socrates \n Socrates \n through \n Plato \n 's dialogue \n Crito \n is attributed with developing the idea of a \n social contract \n whereby people ought to follow the rules of a society and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits \n During the Middle Ages religious scholars particularly such as \n Thomas Aquinas \n continued discussion of justice in various ways but ultimately connected being a good citizen to the purpose of serving God \n After the \n Renaissance \n and \n Reformation \n the modern concept of social justice as developing human potential began to emerge through the work of a series of authors \n Baruch Spinoza \n in \n On the Improvement of the Understanding \n contended that the one true aim of life should be to acquire \"a human character much more stable than one's own\" and to achieve this \"pitch of perfection The chief good is that he should arrive together with other individuals if possible at the possession of the aforesaid character \" \n During the \n enlightenment \n and responding to the \n French \n and \n American Revolutions \n Thomas Paine \n similarly wrote in \n The Rights of Man \n society should give \"genius a fair and universal chance\" and so \"the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions \" \n Social justice \n was coined by \n Jesuit \n priest \n Luigi Taparelli \n in the 1840s \n The first modern usage of the specific term \"social justice\" is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s including the \n Jesuit \n Luigi Taparelli \n in \n Civilt Cattolica \n based on the work of St \n Thomas Aquinas \n He argued that rival \n capitalist \n and \n socialist \n theories based on subjective \n Cartesian \n thinking undermined the unity of society present in \n Thomistic \n metaphysics \n as neither were sufficiently concerned with \n moral \n philosophy \n Writing in the influential British philosopher and economist \n John Stuart Mill \n stated in \n Utilitarianism \n his view that \"Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it that is who have deserved equally well absolutely This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice towards which all institutions and the efforts of all virtuous citizens should be made in the utmost degree to converge \" \n In the later 19th and early 20th century social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy particularly in the work of \n John Dewey \n Roscoe Pound \n and \n Louis Brandeis \n One of the prime concerns was the \n Lochner era \n decisions of the \n US Supreme Court \n to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement such as the \n eight-hour day \n or the right to join a \n trade union \n After the First World War the founding document of the \n International Labour Organization \n took up the same terminology in its preamble stating that \"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\" From this point the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse In the late 20th century a number of liberal and conservative thinkers notably \n Friedrich von Hayek \n rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything or meant too many things \n However the concept remained highly influential particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as \n John Rawls \n Contemporary theory \n Philosophical perspectives \n Cosmic values \n Hunter Lewis \n ' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for \n conservation \n as a key premise in social justice His manifesto on \n sustainability \n ties the continued thriving of human life to real conditions the environment supporting that life and associates injustice with the detrimental effects of \n unintended consequences \n of human actions Quoting classical Greek thinkers like \n Epicurus \n on the good of pursuing happiness Hunter also cites ornithologist naturalist and philosopher \n Alexander Skutch \n in his book Moral Foundations \n The common feature which unites the activities most consistently forbidden by the moral codes of civilized peoples is that by their very nature they cannot be both habitual and enduring because they tend to destroy the conditions which make them possible \n Pope Benedict XVI cites \n Teilhard de Chardin \n in a vision of the cosmos as a 'living host' \n embracing an understanding of ecology that includes humanity's relationship to others that pollution affects not just the natural world but interpersonal relations as well Cosmic harmony justice and peace are closely interrelated \n If you want to cultivate peace protect creation \n John Rawls \n John Rawls \n Political philosopher \n John Rawls \n draws on the \n utilitarian \n insights of \n Bentham \n and \n Mill \n the \n social contract \n ideas of \n John Locke \n and the \n categorical imperative \n ideas of \n Kant \n His first statement of principle was made in \n A Theory of Justice \n where he proposed that \"Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others \" \n A \n deontological \n proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in \n absolutist \n terms His views are definitively restated in \n Political Liberalism \n where society is seen \"as a fair system of co-operation over time from one generation to the next\" \n All societies have a basic structure of social economic and political institutions both formal and informal In testing how well these elements fit and work together Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding Obviously not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement \n The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes and to that extent X holds these powers as a \n trustee \n for the citizen \n X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate The citizen therefore is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way \n This applies to one person who represents a small group e g the organiser of a social event setting a dress code as equally as it does to national governments which are ultimate trustees holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries Governments that fail to provide for \n welfare \n of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments Rawls asserted that \"There is a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty \" \n This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold to some extent the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome According to Rawls the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are \n Freedom of thought \n Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion philosophy and morality \n Political liberties e g representative democratic institutions \n freedom of speech \n and the \n press \n and \n freedom of assembly \n Freedom of association \n Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person namely freedom from slavery freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation and \n Rights and liberties covered by the \n rule of law \n Thomas Pogge \n Thomas Pogge \n 's arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable Pogge argues that social institutions have a \n negative duty \n to not harm the poor \n Pogge speaks of \"institutional cosmopolitanism\" and assigns responsibility to institutional schemes \n for deficits of human rights An example given is slavery and third parties A third party should not recognize or enforce slavery The institutional order should be held responsible only for deprivations of human rights that it establishes or authorizes The current institutional design he says systematically harms developing economies by enabling corporate tax evasion \n illicit financial flows corruption trafficking of people and weapons \n Joshua Cohen \n disputes his claims based on the fact that some poor countries have done well with the current institutional design \n Elizabeth Kahn argues that some of these responsibilities \n vague \n should apply globally \n United Nations \n The United Nations document \n Social Justice in an Open World The Role of the United Nations \n states that \"Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth \" \n The term \"social justice\" was seen by the U N \"as a substitute for the protection of human rights and first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s At the initiative of the Soviet Union and with the support of developing countries the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development adopted in \" \n The same document reports \"From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the \n Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence repression and chaos \" \n The report concludes \"Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent \n redistributive policies \n conceived and implemented by public agencies \" \n The same UN document offers a concise history \" T he notion of social justice is relatively new None of historys great philosophersnot Plato or Aristotle or Confucius or Averroes or even Rousseau or Kantsaw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist \n exploitation of labour \n and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists By the mid-twentieth century the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world \" \n Religious perspectives \n Hinduism \n The present-day \n Jti \n hierarchy is undergoing changes for a variety of reasons including 'social justice' which is a politically popular stance in democratic India Institutionalized affirmative action has promoted this The disparity and wide inequalities in social behaviour of the jtis exclusive endogamous communities centred on traditional occupations has led to various \n reform movements \n in \n Hinduism \n While legally outlawed the caste system remains strong in practice \n Islam \n The \n Quran \n contains numerous references to elements of social justice For example one of Islam's Five Pillars is \n Zakt \n or alms-giving Charity and assistance to the poor concepts central to social justice are and have historically been important parts of the Islamic faith \n In Muslim history Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the \n Abbasid revolt \n against the Umayyads \n The Shi'a believe that the return of the \n Mahdi \n will herald in \"the messianic age of justice\" and the Mahdi along with the Isa Jesus will end plunder torture oppression and discrimination \n For the \n Muslim Brotherhood \n the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of \n consumerism \n and \n communism \n The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work However the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need It held that \n zakat \n alms-giving was not voluntary charity but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate \n Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the \n zakat \n through taxes \n Though monetary donations are the most practiced way of \n zakat \n Islam is deeply rooted in the tenets of \n volunteerism \n and \n social activism \n Areas of one's communities which require assistance and beneficiaries must be a Muslim's foci if need be rather than strictly her or his personal or superficial wants For example the \n ecological \n well-being of the planet i e animal rights global warming natural resources degradation locally nationally globally is a campaign to which every Muslim must adhere Many Muslims practice this today by ensuring that they produce minimal waste give to charity what they no longer need and spend time in prayer and meditation upon the bounties of nature so as to more mindfully approach all that is provided by nature and ultimately \n Allah \n Other areas of society in need may be the safety and security of minority populations i e women or persons of color children the elderly the developmentally or physically disabled animals et al \n Judaism \n Tikkun olam \n In \n To Heal a Fractured World The Ethics of Responsibility \n Rabbi \n Jonathan Sacks \n states that

Christianity \n Methodism \n From its founding Methodism was a Christian social justice movement Under \n John Wesley \n 's direction Methodists became leaders in many social justice issues of the day including the \n prison reform \n and \n abolition \n movements Wesley himself was among the first to preach for slaves rights attracting significant opposition \n Today social justice plays a major role in the \n United Methodist Church \n The \n Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church \n says \"We hold governments responsible for the protection of the rights of the people to free and fair elections and to the freedoms of speech religion assembly communications media and petition for redress of grievances without fear of reprisal to the \n right to privacy \n and to the guarantee of the rights to adequate food clothing shelter education and health care \" \n The United Methodist Church also teaches \n population control \n as part of its doctrine \n Catholicism \n Catholic social teaching \n Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life A distinctive feature of Catholic social doctrine is its concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society Two of the seven key areas \n of \"Catholic social teaching\" are pertinent to social justice \n Life and dignity of the human person The foundational principle of all \"Catholic Social Teaching\" is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person from conception to natural death Human life must be valued above all material possessions \n Preferential option for the poor and \n vulnerable \n Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the \n Day of Judgement \n God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy \"Amen I say to you whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine you did for me \" \n The Catholic Church believes that through words prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with and compassion for the poor The moral test of any society is \"how it treats its most vulnerable members The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor \" \n Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church \n Pope Leo XIII \n who studied under Taparelli published in the \n encyclical \n Rerum novarum \n On the Condition of the Working Classes lit \"On new things\" rejecting both socialism and capitalism while defending labor unions and private property He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not \n class conflict \n and \n competition \n In this document Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony \n The encyclical \n Quadragesimo anno \n On Reconstruction of the Social Order literally \"in the fortieth year\" of by \n Pope Pius XI \n encourages a \n living wage \n subsidiarity \n and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just \n Pope John Paul II \n added much to the corpus of the \n Catholic social teaching \n penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics politics geo-political situations ownership of the means of production private property and the \" \n social mortgage \n \" and private property The encyclicals \n Laborem exercens \n Sollicitudo rei socialis \n and \n Centesimus annus \n are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and \n human rights \n and spoke forcefully for the poor He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused and admits a fear that the \"progress\" of the world is not true progress at all if it should denigrate the value of the human person He argued in \n Centesimus annus \n that private property markets and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person \n Pope Benedict XVI \n 's encyclical \n Deus caritas est \n \"God is Love\" of claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics and not of the church which has charity as its central social concern It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate using reason and natural law and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics \n The official Catholic doctrine on \n social justice \n can be found in the book \n Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \n published in and updated in by the \n Pontifical Council \n Iustitia et Pax \n The Catechism contain more detail of the Church's view of social justice \n Criticism \n Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice \n Moral relativists \n deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general \n Non-cognitivists \n moral skeptics \n moral nihilists \n and most \n logical positivists \n deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice \n Political realists \n believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the \n status quo \n citation needed \n Many other people accept some of the basic principles of social justice such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this One example is the statement by \n H G Wells \n that all people are \"equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen \" \n On the other hand some scholars reject the very idea of social justice as meaningless religious self-contradictory and ideological believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty Perhaps the most complete rejection of the concept of social justice comes from \n Friedrich Hayek \n of the \n Austrian School \n of economics \n There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined would appear just to us Social justice does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense like the term 'a moral stone' \n Ben O'Neill of the \n University of New South Wales \n argues that for proponents of \"social justice\" \n the notion of \"rights\" is a mere term of entitlement indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good no matter how important or trivial abstract or tangible recent or ancient It is merely an assertion of desire and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire \n In fact since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods paid for through the efforts of others the term actually refers to an intention to use \n force \n to acquire one's desires Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action production and voluntary exchange but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them! \n Janusz Korwin-Mikke \n states \"Either 'social justice' has the same meaning as 'justice' or not If so why use the additional word 'social?' We lose time we destroy trees to obtain paper necessary to print this word If not if 'social justice' means something different from 'justice' then 'something different from justice' is by definition 'injustice '\" \n citation needed \n Sociologist \n Carl L Bankston \n has argued that a secular leftist view of social justice entails viewing the redistribution of goods and resources as based on

based on the concepts of human rights and equality and can be defined as \n \"the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society\" \n A number of \n movements \n are working to achieve social justice in society These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society regardless of background or procedural justice have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society \n Liberation theology \n Liberation theology \n Liberation theology \n is a movement in \n Christian \n theology \n which conveys the teachings of \n Jesus Christ \n in terms of a liberation from unjust economic political or social conditions It has been described by proponents as \"an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering their struggle and hope and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor\" \n and by detractors as Christianity perverted by \n Marxism \n and \n Communism \n Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement it began as a movement within the \n Catholic Church \n in Latin America in the 1950s1960s It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region \n It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s The term was coined by the \n Peruvian \n priest \n Gustavo Gutirrez \n who wrote one of the movement's most famous books \n A Theology of Liberation \n According to \n Sarah Kleeb \n \"Marx would surely take issue \" she writes \"with the appropriation of his works in a religious context there is no way to reconcile Marx's views of religion with those of Gutierrez they are simply incompatible Despite this in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path the two have much in common and particularly in the first edition of A Theology of Liberation the use of Marxian theory is quite evident \" \n Other noted exponents are \n Leonardo Boff \n of Brazil \n Carlos Mugica \n of Argentina \n Jon Sobrino \n of El Salvador and \n Juan Luis Segundo \n of Uruguay \n Health care \n Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of \n bioethics \n Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care especially for low income households and families The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare \n Ruth Faden \n of the \n Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics \n and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings \n Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations \n These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level gender education or any other stratifying factors Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model \n Human rights education \n Human rights education \n The \n Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \n affirm that \"Human rights education

practice of protecting the \n natural environment \n on individual organization controlled on governmental levels for the benefit of both the environment and humans Due to the pressures of \n overconsumption \n population and technology the \n biophysical environment \n is being degraded sometimes permanently This has been recognized and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause \n environmental degradation \n Since the 1960s activity of \n environmental movements \n has created awareness of the various \n environmental problems \n There is no agreement on the extent of the \n environmental impact of human activity \n and even \n scientific dishonesty \n occurs so protection measures are occasionally debated \n Approaches with regards to environmental protection \n Voluntary environmental agreements \n Ecosystems approach \n International environmental agreements \n Government \n Tanzania \n History of environmental protection \n Government protection \n China \n European Union \n Russia \n Latin America \n Brazil \n Mexico \n Oceania \n Australia \n New Zealand \n Switzerland \n United States \n In literature \n Approaches with regards to environmental protection \n Voluntary environmental agreements \n In industrial countries voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of best environmental practice For instance in India Environment Improvement Trust EIT has been working for environment & forest protection since A group of Green Volunteers get a goal of Green India Clean India concept CA Gajendra Kumar Jain a Chartered Accountant is the founder of Environment Improvement Trust in Sojat city a small village of State of Rajasthan in India \n In developing countries such as throughout Latin America these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation \n The challenges that exist with these agreements lie in establishing baseline data targets monitoring and reporting Due to the difficulties inherent in evaluating effectiveness their use is often questioned and indeed the whole environment may well be adversely affected as a result The key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity \n Ecosystems approach \n An \n ecosystems \n approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges Ideally the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments as well as representatives of industry environmental groups and community This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation Religions also play an important role in conservation of environment Ref-Hadiya Habib Role of religious education and different religions in conservation and maintenance of environment www oiirj org vol July special issue \n International environmental agreements \n Kyoto Protocol Commitment map \n Many of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across many countries As a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate oceans rivers and air pollution These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and at other times are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as in Europe America and Africa \n Some of the most well-known international agreements include the Kyoto Protocol and others \n Government \n Kyoto Protocol \n Discussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government legislation and law enforcement However in its broadest sense environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry indigenous groups environmental group and community representatives Gradually environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries \n Many constitutions acknowledge the fundamental right to environmental protection and many international treaties acknowledge the right to live in a healthy environment \n Also many countries have organizations and agencies devoted to environmental protection There are international environmental protection organizations such as the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n Although environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of government agencies most people view these agencies as being of prime importance in establishing and maintaining basic standards that protect both the environment and the people interacting with it \n Tanzania \n Tanzania \n is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas including several national parks \n The concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth expansion of subsistence agriculture pollution timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel \n Zebras at the Serengeti savana plains in Tanzania \n 1gbpx|frame|center|environment \n History of environmental protection \n Environmental protection in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa 1884-1919 colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting firewood collecting and cattle grazing \n In year Serengeti was officially established as the first national park for wild cats in East Africa Since there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council NEMC and the development of an environmental act In Environment Improvement Trust EIT start working for environment & forest protection in India from a small city Sojat Founder of Environment Improvement Trust is CA Gajendra Kumar Jain working with volunteers \n Government protection \n Division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection It does this through the formulation of policy coordinating and monitoring environmental issues environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research The National Environment Management Council NEMC is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues The NEMC the following purposes provide technical advice coordinate technical activities develop enforcement guidelines and procedures assess monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment promote and assist environmental information and communication and seek advancement of scientific knowledge \n The National Environment Policy of acts as a framework for environmental decision making in Tanzania The policy objectives are to achieve the following \n Ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources without degrading the environment or risking health or safety \n Prevent and control degradation of land water vegetation and air \n Conserve and enhance natural and man-made heritage including biological diversity of unique ecosystems \n Improve condition and productivity of degraded areas \n Raise awareness and understanding of the link between environment and development \n Promote individual and community participation \n Promote international cooperation \n Tanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment and the Convention on Biological Diversity The Environmental Management Act is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions The policy tools that are parts of the act includes the use of environmental-impact assessments strategics environmentals assessments and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products The effectiveness of shifing of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that historically there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice \n China \n The \n Longwanqun National Forest Park \n is a nationally protected nature area in Huinan County Jilin China \n Formal environmental protection in China House was first stimulated by the \n United Nations Conference on the Human Environment \n held in Stockholm Sweden Following this they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy In the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China's basic national policies and in the National Environmental Protection Agency NEPA was established Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency SEPA meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level In SEPA became known by its current name of \n Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China \n MEP \n Pollution control instruments in China \n

China's GDP This grew to 3% by and the economic loss from water pollution 1% began to exceed that caused by air pollution \n China has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth 64% in the past ten years \n However the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries In China was ranked 121st out of countries on the \n Environmental Performance Index \n China has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation \n China's investment in renewable energy grew 18% in to $15 billion accounting for ~10% of the global investment in this area \n In spending on the environment was 49% of GDP up times from \n The discharge of CO carbon monoxide and SO2 sulfur dioxide decreased by 61% and 95% in compared with that in \n China's protected nature reserves have increased substantially In there were only compared with in The protected nature reserve system now occupies 5% of the country this is higher than the world average \n Rapid growth in GDP has been China's main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high GDP For China to develop sustainably environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies \n Quote from Shengxian Zhou head of MEP \"Good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure production form and develop

world's tropical forests km2 1% of Brazil concentrated in the Amazon region \n Brazil is home to vast biological diversity first among the \n megadiverse countries \n of the world having between 15%-20% of the million globally described species \n The organization in charge of environment protection is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment in Portuguese Ministrio do Meio Ambiente MMA \n It was first created in year with the name Special Secretariat for the Environment Secretaria Especial de Meio Ambiente changing names several times and adopting the final name in year The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues \n A national policy for the environment and for water resources \n A policy for the preservation conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems biodiversity and forests \n Proposing strategies mechanisms economic and social instruments for improving environmental quality and sustainable use of natural resources \n Policies for integrating

\n is home to 1012% of the world's biodiversity ranking first in \n reptile \n biodiversity and second in \n mammals \n one estimate indicates that over 50% of all animal and plant species live in Mexico \n The history of environmental policy in Mexico started in the 1940s with the enactment of the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water in Spanish Ley de Conservacin de Suelo y Agua Three decades later at the beginning of the 1970s the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminacin Ambiental \n In year was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues It established the administrative organization of the Secretariat for the Improvement of the Environment

the formation of the first National Park \n Royal National Park \n in \n More progressive environmental protection had it start in the 1960s and 1970s with major international programs such as the \n United Nations Conference on the Human Environment \n in the Environment Committee of the \n OECD \n in and the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n of \n These events laid the foundations by increasing public awareness and support for regulation State environmental legislation was irregular and deficient until the Australian Environment Council AEC and Council of Nature Conservation Ministers CONCOM were established in and creating a forum to assist in coordinating environmental and conservation policies between states and neighbouring countries \n These councils have since been replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council ANZECC in and finally the Environment Protection and Heritage Council EPHC in \n At a national level the \n Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act \n is the primary environmental protection legislation for the Commonwealth of Australia It concerns matters of national and international environmental significance regarding flora fauna ecological communities and cultural heritage \n It also has jurisdiction over any activity conducted by the Commonwealth or affecting it that has significant

communities \n Nuclear activities and actions \n Great Barrier Reef Marine Park \n Migratory species \n Commonwealth Marine areas \n There are several Commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners such as \n Kakadu National Park \n extraordinary biodiversity such as \n Christmas Island National Park \n or managed cooperatively due to cross-state location such as the \n Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves \n At a state level the bulk of environmental protection issues are left to the responsibility of the state or territory \n Each state in Australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies Their jurisdiction is similar and covers point-source pollution such as from industry or commercial activities land/water use and waste management Most protected lands are managed by states and territories \n with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness national land and marine parks state forests and conservation areas States also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air water and sound pollution \n At a local level each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation This includes non-point source or diffuse pollution such as sediment pollution from construction sites \n Australia ranks second place on the UN \n Human Development Index \n and one of the lowest debt to \n GDP \n ratios of the developed economies \n This could be seen as coming at the cost of

{"theme.id": 7, "title": "Altruism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism", "depth": 0, "text": "Altruism \n For the concept in behavioral ecology see \n Altruism biology \n Giving \n alms \n to the poor is often considered an altruistic action \n Altruism \n or \n selflessness \n is the principle or practice of concern for the \n welfare \n of others It is a traditional \n virtue \n in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of \"others\" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of \n selfishness \n The word was coined by the French philosopher \n Auguste Comte \n in French as \n altruisme \n for an \n antonym \n of \n egoism \n He derived it from the Italian \n altrui \n which in turn was derived from Latin \n alteri \n meaning \" \n other people \n \" or \"somebody else\" \n Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves e g pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another third-party individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is \"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards\" \n Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of \n loyalty \n in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships Much debate exists as to whether \n \"true\" \n altruism is possible in human psychology The theory of \n psychological egoism \n suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal \n gratification \n The validity of this argument depends on whether \n intrinsic rewards \n qualify as \"benefits\" The actor also may not be expecting a reward \n The term \n altruism \n may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others Used in this sense it is usually contrasted with \n egoism \n which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self \n The notion of altruism \n Scientific viewpoints \n Anthropology \n Evolutionary explanations \n Neurobiology \n Psychology \n Sociology \n Pathological altruism \n Religious viewpoints \n Buddhism \n Jainism \n Christianity \n Islam \n Judaism \n Sikhism \n Hinduism \n Philosophy \n Genetics \n Notes \n The notion of altruism \n The concept has a long history in \n philosophical \n and \n ethical \n thought The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding \n sociologist \n and \n philosopher of science \n Auguste Comte \n and has become a major topic for \n psychologists \n especially \n evolutionary psychology \n researchers \n evolutionary biologists \n and \n ethologists \n Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism In simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them \n Scientific viewpoints \n Anthropology \n Marcel Mauss \n 's book \n The Gift \n contains a passage called \"Note on alms\" This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice In it he writes \n Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other Generosity is an obligation because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it This is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children \n Compare \n Altruism ethics perception of altruism as self-sacrifice \n Compare \n explanation of alms in various scriptures \n Evolutionary explanations \n Main articles \n Altruism in animals \n Evolution of morality \n and \n Evolutionary ethics \n Giving alms to beggar children \n In the science of \n ethology \n the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of \n social evolution \n altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the \n fitness \n of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor \n In \n evolutionary psychology \n this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners \n tipping \n courtship gifts production of \n public goods \n and \n environmentalism \n Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from \n evolutionary game theory \n a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies \n Some of the proposed mechanisms are \n Kin selection \n That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior One kinship cue is facial resemblance One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons Another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helpful behavior Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study This effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families \n Vested interests People are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social \n ingroups \n suffer or even disappear Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile \n outgroup \n threatens to kill the entire ingroup \n Reciprocal altruism \n Reciprocity evolution \n Direct \n reciprocity \n Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help The effective \n tit for tat \n strategy is one \n game theoretic \n example Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return \n One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a \"Community Game\" instead of a \"Wall Street Game \" \n A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped On the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts As such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation \n People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population Thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group \n Indirect reciprocity \n The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's \n reputation \n to become very important A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously \n Strong reciprocity \n A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence \n Pseudo-reciprocity \n An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist \n Costly signaling \n and the \n handicap principle \n Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an \"honest signal\" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics \n Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else Similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability \n Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the \n Houston Astrodome \n following Hurricane Katrina \n Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else This have been documented in many studies The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects \n Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns \n Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners When looking for a long-term partner altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success \n People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause \n competitive altruism \n On the other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous This may possibly be due to reasons such as \n psychopathy \n or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative \n Explicit \n extrinsic \n rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards This may be because such extrinsic top-down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non-cooperators A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all \n Group selection \n It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as \n David Sloan Wilson \n that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level Thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members See also \n in-group favoritism \n Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists \n Helping the \n homeless \n in New York City \n Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their \n inclusive fitness \n when they are doing altruistic acts Instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors \n Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits \n The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non-competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup \n The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind \n George R Price \n 's development of the \n Price equation \n which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular \n slime moulds \n such as \n Dictyostelium \n mucoroides \n These protists live as individual \n amoebae \n until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body \n Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long-term high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success \n Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist \n Peter Kropotkin \n in his book \n Mutual Aid A Factor of Evolution \n and \n Peter Singer \n in his book \n A Darwinian Left \n Neurobiology \n Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman neuroscientists at the \n National Institutes of Health \n and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network J M provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using \n functional magnetic resonance imaging \n In their research published in the \n Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \n USA in October \n they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the \n mesolimbic \n reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex However when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex/ \n septal region \n These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species Altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard-wired and pleasurable \n One brain region the subgenual \n anterior cingulate \n cortex/ \n basal forebrain \n contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with trait empathy \n The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding \n In fact in an experiment published in March at the \n University of Southern California \n neuroscientist \n Antonio R Damasio \n and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the \n ventromedial prefrontal cortex \n lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that When confronted with moral dilemmas these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with \"end-justifies-the-means\" answers leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains According to \n Adrian Raine \n a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse Without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?\" \n In another study in the 1990s Dr Bill Harbaugh a \n University of Oregon \n economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in with his psychologist colleague Dr Ulrich Mayr reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups \"egoists\" and \"altruists\" One of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered \"egoists\" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as a person's environment and values \n Psychology \n The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines \n psychological altruism \n as \"a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare \" Psychological altruism is contrasted with \n psychological egoism \n which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare \n There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism \n Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors \n However because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question The \n social exchange theory \n postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self \n Daniel Batson \n is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory He identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle \n principlism \n Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless \n The \n empathy-altruism \n hypothesis \n basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering \n Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues \n Peace Corps \n trainees swearing in as volunteers in \n Cambodia \n April \n In psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service \n Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the \n Bystander effect \n Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility \n However a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders \n A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving \n Many studies have observed the effects of \n volunteerism \n as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being \n In a study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in \n depression \n anxiety \n and \n somatization \n Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages \n One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one \n A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying After controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality \n Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness \n It is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite directionthat happier people are also kinder The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states \n Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness \n For example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant \n Additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that \"a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well-being \" \n Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as \"the helper's high\" \n Sociology \n \"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society\" \"Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity\" American Sociological Association \n The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro-social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field The American Sociology Association ASA acknowledges \n Public sociology \n saying \"The intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable\" \"Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity\" ASA This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies How altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and \"build the good society\" \n Public sociology \n Pathological altruism \n Pathological \n altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good \n The term \"pathological altruism\" was popularised by the book \n Pathological Altruism \n Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid \n Religious viewpoints \n Evolutionary origin of religions \n Most if not all of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value \n Buddhism \n Christianity \n Hinduism \n Islam \n Jainism \n Judaism \n and \n Sikhism \n etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality \n Buddhism \n Monks collecting alms \n Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering \"Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being\" Dalai Lama \n Still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness \"The more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well-being becomes\" Dalai Lama \n In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness \n Jainism \n Ahimsa in Jainism \n Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of \n ahimsa \n non-injury \n The fundamental principles of \n Jainism \n revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings Jainism preaches the view of \n Ahimsa \n to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i e uncompromising reverence for all life It also considers all living things to be equal The first \n Tirthankara \n Rishabhdev \n introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non-violence and compassion for all living things \n Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors One's unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans Anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment \n Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks They are \n Non-violence Ahimsa \n Truthfulness Satya \n Non-stealing Asteya \n Celibacy Brahmacharya \n Non-possession \n or non-materialism Aparigraha \n The \"great vows\" \n Mahavrata \n are prescribed for monks and \"limited vows\" \n Anuvrata \n are prescribed for householders The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows The monks have to observe them very strictly With consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress \n The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul Jainism views every \n soul \n as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become \n Siddha \n God in Jainism \n Because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one's actions Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small This policy extends even to microscopic organisms Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders \n Christianity \n Statue of \n Mother Teresa \n in India \n Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the \n Gospel \n especially in the \n Sermon on the Mount \n and the \n Sermon on the Plain \n From biblical to medieval \n Christian traditions \n tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of \"disinterested love\" as in the \n Pauline \n phrase \"love seeks not its own interests \" In his book \n Indoctrination and Self-deception \n Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many Love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person's experience and practice from within As in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection \n St Thomas Aquinas \n interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' \n as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others \n Considering that \"the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship\" and quotes Aristotle that \"the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves \" \n he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part However he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily lifesince the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being In coining the word Altruism as stated above \n Comte \n was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism \n Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God John states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God \n Thomas Jay Oord \n has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love An altruistic action is not always a loving action Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being \n German philosopher \n Max Scheler \n distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak One way is a sincere expression of Christian love \"motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence\" \n Another way is merely \"one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business \" \n At its worst Scheler says \"love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse \" \n Islam \n In \n Islam \n the concept 'eysaar' altruism is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself' For Sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body considered to be property of ALLAH alone The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good \n Islam \n considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility \n This is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that European concept in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence A constant concern for \n ALLAH \n i e God results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world \n This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like \n Rabia al-Adawiyya \n who paid attention to the difference between dedication to \n ALLAH \n i e God and dedication to people Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet \n Yunus Emre \n explained this philosophy as \"Yaratlan severiz Yaratandan tr\" or \n We love the creature because of The Creator \n For many Muslims i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays However i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times \n Judaism \n Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation The famous Rabbi \n Abraham Isaac Kook \n stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity \n This is defined as \n bestowal \n or giving which is the intention of altruism This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God \n Kabbalah \n defines God as the force of giving in \n existence \n Rabbi \n Moshe Chaim Luzzatto \n in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force \n Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi \n Yehuda Ashlag \n in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework \n Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another Ashlag focused on society and its relation to \n divinity \n Sikhism

imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness The fifth Nanak Guru Arjun Dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the Guru Granth The ninth Guru Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity In the late seventeenth century \n Guru Gobind Singh \n Ji the tenth \n guru \n in Sikhism was in war with the \n Mughal \n rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh \n Bhai Kanhaiya \n attended the troops of the enemy He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield \"What were you doing and why?\" asked the Guru \"I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them \" replied Bhai Kanhaiya The Guru responded \"Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru \" \n It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same \n Hinduism \n Swami Sivananda \n an \n Advaita \n scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the \n Brahma Sutras \n a Vedantic text In his commentary on Chapter of the Brahma Sutras Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed Hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit Furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates \n apurva \n or \n punya \n which gives fruit Since apurva is non-sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment \n However the very well known and popular text the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga selfless action or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality \n Philosophy \n Altruism ethics \n There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically Proponents of \n ethical altruism \n maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically The opposing view is \n ethical egoism \n which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with \n utilitarianism \n which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants \n A related concept in \n descriptive ethics \n is \n psychological egoism \n the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible \n Rational egoism \n is the view that \n rationality \n consists in acting in one's self-interest without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations \n Genetics \n The genes \n OXTR \n CD38 \n COMT \n DRD4 \n DRD5 \n IGF2 \n GABRB2 \n have been found to be candidate genes for altruism \n Altruria

Render unto Caesar \n \" of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties secular and religious without conflict but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to God the latter takes precedence \n The \n Encyclopdia Britannica \n Eleventh Edition \n defines loyalty as \"allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one's country\" and also \"personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family\" It traces the word \" \n loyalty \n \" to the 15th century noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service in love or to an \n oath \n that one has made The meaning that the \n Britannica \n gives as primary it attributes to a shift during the 16th century noting that the origin of the word is in the \n Old French \n \" \n loialte \n \" that is in turn rooted in the \n Latin \n \" \n lex \n \" meaning \" \n law \n \" One who is loyal in the \n feudal \n sense of \n fealty \n is one who is lawful as opposed to an \n outlaw \n who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful \n allegiance \n to a feudal lord Hence the \n Britannica \n derived its early 20th century primary meaning of loyalty to a \n monarch \n East Asia \n Zhong \n clarification needed \n Often cited as one of the many virtues of \n Confucianism \n meaning to do the best you can do for others \n \"Loyalty\" is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in \n Bushido \n It combines other six virtues such as Righteousness \n gi? \n Courage \n y? \n Benevolence \n jin? \n Respect \n rei? \n Sincerity \n makoto? \n Honour \n meiyo? \n and formed the Bushido code \"It is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal\" \n Modern concepts \n Josiah Royce \n presented a different definition of the concept in his book \n The Philosophy of Loyalty \n According to Royce loyalty is a \n virtue \n indeed a primary virtue \"the heart of all the virtues the central duty amongst all the duties\" Royce presents loyalty which he defines at length as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived \n The short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is \"the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause\" \n Loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause \n Royce's view of loyalty was challenged by Ladd in the article on \"Loyalty\" in the first edition of the Macmillan \n Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n Ralls observes that Ladd's article is the Macmillan \n Encyclopaedia \n ' \n s only article on a virtue and praises it for its \"magnificent\" declaration by Ladd that \"a loyal Nazi is a contradiction in terms\" \n Ladd asserts that contrary to Royce causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal not impersonal or suprapersonal \n He states that Royce's view has \"the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men The individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into 'superhuman' good\" Ronald F Duska the Lamont Post Chair of Ethics and the Professions at \n The American College \n extends Ladd's objection saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one's self-will to be identified with anything as Royce would have it Even if one were identifying one's self-will with God to be worthy of such loyalty God would have to be the \n summum bonum \n the perfect manifestation of good \n Ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal i e a relationship between a lord and vassal parent and child or two good friends Duska states that doing so leads to a problem that Ladd overlooks Loyalty may certainly be between two persons but it may also be from a person to a group of people Examples of this which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty are loyalty by a person to his/her family to a team that he/she is a member/fan of or to his/her country The problem with this that Duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved and whether Ladd's contention that loyalty is interpersonalnot suprapersonalis an adequate description \n Ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives its proper object and its moral value \n Additional aspects enumerated by Kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects \n The proper object of loyalty \n Ladd and others including \n Milton R Konvitz \n yearneeded \n and Marcia W Baron \n disagree amongst themselves as to the proper \n object of \n loyaltywhat it is possible to be loyal \n to \n in other words Ladd as stated considers loyalty to be interpersonal and that the object of loyalty is always a person In the \n Encyclopaedia of the History of Ideas \n Konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles causes ideas ideals religions ideologies nations governments parties leaders families friends regions racial groups and \"anyone or anything to which one's heart can become attached or devoted\" Baron agrees with Ladd inasmuch as loyalty is \"to certain people or to a group of people not loyalty to an ideal or cause\" She argues in her \n monograph \n The Moral Status of Loyalty \n that \" w hen we speak of causes or ideals we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them\" Kleinig agrees with Baron noting that a person's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values causes and ideals He disagrees however with the notion that loyalties are restricted \n solely \n to personal attachments considering it \"incorrect as a matter of logic \" \n Loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an \n evolutionary tactic \n as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs \n Multiplicity disloyalty and whether loyalty is exclusionary \n Stephen Nathanson professor of Philosophy at \n Northeastern University \n states that loyalty can be either \n exclusionary \n or \n non-exclusionary \n and can be \n single \n or \n multiple \n Exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not People may have single loyalties to just one person group or thing or multiple loyalties to multiple objects Multiple loyalties can constitute a \n disloyalty \n to an object if one of those loyalties is \n exclusionary \n excluding one of the others However Nathanson observes this is a special case In the general case the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty One can for example be loyal to one's friends or one's family and still without contradiction be loyal to one's religion or profession \n Other dimensions \n In addition to \n number \n and \n exclusion \n as just outlined Nathanson enumerates five other \"dimensions\" that loyalty can vary along basis strength scope legitimacy and attitude \n Loyalties differ in \n basis \n according to their foundations They may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty such as biological ties or place of birth a notion of natural allegiance propounded by \n Socrates \n in his political theory Alternatively they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom The degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple Nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one's parents or relatives one \n can \n choose to desert them \n Loyalties differ in \n strength \n They can range from supreme loyalties that override all other considerations to merely presumptive loyalties that affect one's presumptions providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations Nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis \" \n Blood is thicker than water \n \" states an aphorism explaining that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger \n Loyalties differ in \n scope \n They range from loyalties with limited scope that require few actions of the subject to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes which require many actions or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty Loyalty to one's job for example may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires Loyalty to a family member can in contrast have a very broad effect upon one's actions requiring considerable personal sacrifice Extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties Scope encompasses an element of \n constraint \n Where two or more loyalties conflict their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty \n Loyalties differ in \n legitimacy \n This is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties People with one loyalty can hold that another conflicting loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate In the extreme view one that Nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples all loyalties bar one's own are considered illegitimate The xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions At the other end of the spectrum past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not according to cases or plain and simple indifference to other people's loyalties is the positive regard of other people's loyalties \n Finally loyalties differ in the \n attitude \n that the subjects of the loyalties have towards other people Note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the \n subjects \n of the loyalty whereas legitimacy above concerns the loyalties themselves People may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties with hate and disdain at one end indifference in the middle and concern and positive feeling at the other \n In relation to other subjects \n Patriotism \n Patriotism \n Nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism He states that this is however not actually the case arguing that whilst patriots exhibit loyalty it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots He provides the example of a \n mercenary \n soldier who exhibits loyalty to the people/country that pays him Nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot A mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of \n professionalism \n or a belief in the sanctity of \n contracts \n A patriot in contrast may be motivated by affection concern identification and a willingness to sacrifice \n Nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue A loyal person can in general be relied upon and hence people view loyalty as virtuous Nathanson argues that loyalty can however be given to persons or causes that are unworthy Moreover loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane Thus Nathanson argues patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable Such loyalties in Nathanson's view are erroneously \n unlimited \n in their scopes and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality \n Whistleblowing \n Whistleblowing \n Several scholars including Duska discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing Wim Vandekerckhove of the \n University of Greenwich \n points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a \n bidirectional \n loyaltybetween employees and their employer Previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer but not that an employer need be loyal to employees The ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his/her community which the employer's business practices may be adversely affecting Vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways some of which he himself does not find to be satisfactory Duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances the community a position that Vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty \n John Corvino associate professor of Philosophy at \n Wayne State University \n takes a different tack arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice not a virtue and that \"loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good\" similar to Nathanson Vandekerckhove calls this argument \"interesting\" but \"too vague\" in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer's shortcomings Vandekerckhove suggests that Duska and Corvino combine however to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing by clarifying the objects of those loyalties \n Marketing \n Loyalty business model \n Businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers \n Brand loyalty \n is a consumer's preference for a particular \n brand \n and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand \n Loyalty programs \n offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits \n One similar concept is \n fan loyalty \n an allegiance to and abiding interest in a \n sports team \n fictional character \n or fictional series Devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons \n In the Bible \n Attempting to serve two masters leads to double-mindedness \n James \n undermining loyalty to a cause The \n Bible \n also speaks of loyal ones which would be those who follow the Bible with absolute loyalty as in \"Precious in the eyes of God is the death of his loyal ones\" \n Psalms \n Most Jewish and Christian authors view the \n binding of Isaac \n Genesis \n in which \n Abraham \n was called by God to offer his son Isaac as a \n burnt offering \n as a test of Abraham's loyalty \n Joseph \n 's faithfulness to his master \n Potiphar \n and his rejection of Potiphar's wife's advances \n Genesis \n have also been called an example of the virtue of loyalty \n Misplaced \n Misplaced loyalty \n Misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or \n organisations \n where that loyalty is not acknowledged or \n respected \n is \n betrayed \n or taken advantage of It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause \n Social psychology \n provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way \"the \n norm of social commitment \n directs us to honor our agreements People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse\" \n Humanists \n point out that \"man inherits the capacity for loyalty but not the use to which he shall put it may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile as he may to what is generous and noble\" \n In animals \n Foxie guarding the body of her master \n Charles Gough \n in \n Attachment \n by \n Edwin Landseer \n Animals as \n pets \n have a large sense of loyalty to humans Famous cases include \n Greyfriars Bobby \n who attended his master's grave for fourteen years \n Hachiko \n who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his \n death \n and Foxie the \n spaniel \n belonging to \n Charles Gough \n who stayed by her dead master's side for three months on \n Helvellyn \n in the \n Lake District \n in although it is possible that Foxie had eaten Gough's body \n In the \n Mahabharata \n the righteous King \n Yudhishthira \n appears at the gates of Heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death The god \n Indra \n is prepared to admit him to Heaven but refuses to admit the dog so Yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog and prepares to turn away from the gates of Heaven Then the dog is revealed to be the manifestation of \n Dharma \n the god of righteousness and justice and who turned out to be his deified self Yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog the god of righteousness \n Yudhishthira is known by the \n epithet \n Dharmaputra the lord of righteous duty"},

all people \n According to the \n Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or \n social status \n According to the \n Merriam-Webster Dictionary \n the term has two distinct definitions in modern English \n either as a political \n doctrine \n that all people should be treated as equals and have the same \n political \n economic \n social \n and \n civil rights \n or as a social philosophy advocating the \n removal of economic inequalities among people \n economic egalitarianism \n or the \n decentralization of power \n Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity \n Forms \n Legal egalitarianism \n Equality of person \n Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \n Gender equality \n Social egalitarianism \n Economic \n Egalitarianism and non-human animals \n Religious and spiritual egalitarianism \n Sikhism \n Christianity \n Judaism \n Islam \n Military egalitarianism \n Modern egalitarianism theory \n Reception \n Marxism \n Forms \n Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include \n communism \n legal egalitarianism \n luck egalitarianism \n political egalitarianism \n gender egalitarianism \n racial equality \n equality of outcome \n and \n Christian egalitarianism \n Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical \n Legal egalitarianism \n Further information \n equality before the law \n One argument is that \n liberalism \n provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights \n Equality of person \n The \n English Bill of Rights of \n and the \n United States Constitution \n use only the term \"person\" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities except for a a reference to \"men\" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason and b a rule of proportional Congressional representation in the \n 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \n As the rest of the Constitution in its operative language the \n 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \n uses the term \"person\" stating for example that \" nor shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\" \n Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \n An example of this form is the \n Tunisian Constitution of \n which provides that \"men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties\" \n Gender equality \n The motto \" \n Libert galit fraternit \n \" was used during the \n French Revolution \n and is still used as an official motto of the French government The \n Rights of Man and of the Citizen \n French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind \n The \n Declaration of Independence of the United States \n is an example of an assertion of equality of men the wording of \"men\" and \"man\" is a reference to both men and women i e \"mankind\" \n all men are created equal \n \" \n John Locke \n is sometimes considered the founder of this form \n Many state constitutions in the United States also use \"rights of man\" language rather than \"rights of person\" since the noun \"man\" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women \n It is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women \n Social egalitarianism \n At a cultural level egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are \n socialism \n communism \n social anarchism \n libertarian socialism \n left-libertarianism \n and \n progressivism \n some of which propound \n economic egalitarianism \n Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among \n intellectuals \n and in the general populations of many countries However whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question A position of opposition to egalitarianism is anti-egalitarianism \n Economic \n An early example of equality of outcome economic egalitarianism is \n Xu Xing \n a scholar of the Chinese philosophy of \n agriculturalism \n who supported the \n fixing of prices \n and in which all similar goods and services regardless of differences in quality and demand are set at exactly the same unchanging price \n In \n socialism \n social ownership \n of \n means of production \n is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership the \n surplus product \n generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another Although the economist \n Karl Marx \n is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether However Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific \n economic systems \n The American economist \n John Roemer \n has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of \n distributive justice \n shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be \n proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production \n is inadequate Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized \n Egalitarianism and non-human animals \n Many philosophers including Ingmar Persson \n Peter Vallentyne \n Nils Holtug \n and \n Lewis Gompertz \n have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that \"Egalitarianism implies rejecting \n speciesism \n and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals as well as assisting them \n in nature \n \" \n Furthermore Horta argues that \"because nonhuman animals are worse off in comparison to humans egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests nonhuman animals \" \n Religious and spiritual egalitarianism \n Sikhism \n The \n Sikh \n faith was founded upon egalitarian principles reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race but also between the genders This equality led to denunciation of sati the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the \n funeral pyres \n of deceased husbands albeit being very rare at the time but occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation than becoming the bounty of war for the marauding \n jihadists \n that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism with greater rigidity than the \n Hindu \n archetype from which the practice was inherited \n Despite the rhetoric of equality scholars have \"found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes\" \n Furthermore despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism denouncing sexism female infanticide dowry sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolationthe reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent like \n Hindus \n Buddhists \n and \n Jains \n Christianity \n Main articles \n Christian egalitarianism \n Christian communism \n and \n Christian universalism \n The \n Christian egalitarian \n view holds that the \n Bible \n teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes all economic classes and all age groups but within the teachings and example of \n Jesus Christ \n God \n and the overarching principles of scripture \n Within the wide range of \n Christianity \n there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups some of which are \n complementarians \n There many that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure for example parents having authority over their children These ideas are considered by some to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism At its foundation \n Galatians \n holds \"There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus\" defining all as equal in the sight of God Similarly \n Colossians \n says \"Here there is no Gentile or Jew circumcised or uncircumcised barbarian \n Scythian \n slave or free but Christ is all and is in all\" defining all as equal in the sight of God in relationship to faith in Jesus Christ Various Christian groups have attempted to hold to this view and develop Christian oriented communities In \n Acts \n chapter members of the early Christian community sell their possessions give the proceeds to a common fund overseen by the disciples then take \"according to their need\" One of the most notable of present-day communities are the \n Hutterite \n groups of Europe and North America living in agricultural and collective communities \n Judaism \n Judaism \n is not a \n universalist \n religion and teaches that \n Jews \n defined as either the biological descendants of \n Jacob \n \"Israel\" the son of Isaac and grandson of \n Abraham \n or someone who converted have a specific covenant with \n God \n as a \n chosen people \n Deutoronomy \n \"chosen as God's \n treasured people \n \" to serve as an example of \n God's light \n to the rest of the world The oral Torah and \n Rabbinic literature \n codified in the \n Talmud \n makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the \n gentiles \n literally \"the nations\" However Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the \n Seven Laws of Noah \n In this aspect Judaism is universalist in its divine message but not in its religious obligations In \n reform \n and \n conservative Judaism \n egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations \n Synagogues \n that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating i e no \n mechitza \n and allow women to lead \n services \n with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the \n Torah \n Islam \n The \n Islamic \n stance on equality is not similar to that of Christianity it doesn't stress that all humans are equal in the eyes of God regardless of gender class and race The \n Quran \n states \"O mankind indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another Indeed the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you Indeed Allah is Knowing and Acquainted\" \n Louise Marlow's \n Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought \n compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice \n Military egalitarianism \n Military egalitarianism has been noted since ancient times such as with Shakespeare's \n St Crispin's Day Speech \n This occurs in spite of the distinctions military forces attempt to make between officers and enlisted men For example former Major General \n Charles J Dunlap Jr \n said that \n United States Air Force \n culture included an egalitarianism bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft \n Modern egalitarianism theory \n Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically politically and socially Modern egalitarianism theory or \"new egalitarianism\" outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other In essence the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talentsthese differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other \n Reception \n The \n cultural theory of risk \n holds egalitarianism as defined by a negative attitude towards rules and principles and a positive attitude towards group decision-making with \n fatalism \n termed as its opposite \n The theory distinguishes between \n hierarchists \n who are positive towards both rules and groups and egalitarianists who are positive towards groups but negative towards rules \n This is by definition a form of \"anarchist equality\" as referred to by \n Berkman \n The fabric of an \"egalitarianist society\" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit \n peer pressure \n rather than by explicit rules and punishment However Thompson et al theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective be it egalitarianist hierarchist \n individualist \n fatalist \n or \n autonomist \n will be inherently unstable the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling For instance although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles \n Accordingly egalitarianists have no power except through their presence unless they by definition reluctantly embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group autonomists or individualists \n Alexander Berkman \n suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp True anarchist equality implies freedom not quantity It does not mean that every one must eat drink or wear the same things do the same work or live in the same manner Far from it the very reverse in fact Individual needs and tastes differ as appetites differ It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality Far from levelling such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development For human character is diverse\" \n Marxism \n Karl Marx \n and \n Friedrich Engels \n believed that a revolution would bring about a \n socialist \n society which would then eventually give way to a \n communist \n stage of social development which would be a classless stateless humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability to each according to his needs\" \n However \n Marxism \n rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest such as a universal notion of \"equality\" but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desiresthus Marx's notion of \n communist society \n is radically individualistic \n Marx was a proponent of two principles the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society \" \n To each according to his contribution \n \" and \" \n From each according to their ability to each according to their needs \n \" Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic \n \" \n All men are created equal \n \" \n Anarchism \n Basic income \n Deep ecology \n Discrimination \n Elitism \n Equal opportunity \n Equality of outcome \n Feminism \n Same-sex marriage \n Gift economy

finally communicating the results \" \n Aspects \n Theories of creativity particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others have focused on a variety of aspects The dominant factors are usually identified as \"the four Ps\" process product person and place according to \n Mel Rhodes \n A focus on \n process \n is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking such as \n Guilford \n or those describing the staging of the creative process such as \n Wallas \n are primarily theories of creative process A focus on creative \n product \n usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics see below and in creative ideas framed as successful \n memes \n The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more \n A focus on the nature of the creative \n person \n considers more general intellectual habits such as openness levels of \n ideation \n autonomy expertise exploratory behavior and so on A focus on \n place \n considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes such as degrees of autonomy access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility \n Etymology \n The \n lexeme \n in the English word \n creativity \n comes from the \n Latin \n term \n cre \n \"to create make\" its \n derivational suffixes \n also come from Latin The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century notably in Chaucer to indicate divine creation \n in \n The Parson's Tale \n However its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after \n the Enlightenment \n History of the concept \n History of the concept of creativity \n Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity preferring to see art as a form of discovery Asked in \n The Republic \n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" Plato answers \"Certainly not he merely \n imitates \n \" \n Ancient views \n Most ancient cultures including thinkers of \n Ancient Greece \n Ancient China \n and \n Ancient India \n lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation The \n ancient Greeks \n had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \" \n poiein \n \" \"to make\" which only applied to \n poiesis \n poetry and to the \n poietes \n poet or \"maker\" who made it \n Plato \n did not believe in art as a form of creation Asked in \n The Republic \n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" he answers \"Certainly not he merely \n imitates \n \" \n It is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in \n Western culture \n through \n Christianity \n as a matter of \n divine inspiration \n According to the historian \n Daniel J Boorstin \n \"the early Western conception of creativity was the \n Biblical story of creation \n given in the \n Genesis \n \" \n However this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the \n Renaissance \n In the Judaeo-Christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work \n A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance \n Muses \n were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods \n Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \" \n daemon \n \" Greek or \" \n genius \n \" Latin linked to the sacred or the divine However none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the \n Renaissance \n It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of \" \n great men \n \" \n The Enlightenment and after \n The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the \n Renaissance \n and even later \n The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the \n Renaissance \n when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named \n humanism \n which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual \n From this philosophy arose the \n Renaissance man \n or polymath an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation \n One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is \n Leonardo da Vinci \n However this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment \n By the 18th century and the \n Age of Enlightenment \n mention of creativity notably in \n aesthetics \n linked with the concept of \n imagination \n became more frequent \n In the writing of \n Thomas Hobbes \n imagination became a key element of human cognition \n William Duff \n was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of \n genius \n typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius \n As a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century \n Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of \n Darwinism \n In particular they refer to the work of \n Francis Galton \n who through his \n eugenicist \n outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius \n In the late 19th and early 20th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as \n Hermann von Helmholtz \n and \n Henri Poincar \n began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes \n Twentieth century to the present day \n The insights of Poincar and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as \n Graham Wallas \n and \n Max Wertheimer \n In his work \n Art of Thought \n published in Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process In the Wallas stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of stages \n i \n preparation \n preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions \n ii \n incubation \n where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening \n iii \n intimation \n the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way \n iv \n illumination \n or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its \n preconscious \n processing into conscious awareness \n v \n verification \n where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied \n Wallas' model is often treated as four stages with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage \n Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the \n evolutionary \n process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments Simonton \n provides an updated perspective on this view in his book \n Origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity \n In \n Alfred North Whitehead \n gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as \n Process and Reality \n He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme \"Whitehead actually coined the term our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that its invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded\" \n The formal \n psychometric \n measurement of creativity from the standpoint of orthodox \n psychological \n literature is usually considered to have begun with \n J P Guilford \n 's address to the \n American Psychological Association \n which helped popularize the topic \n and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as with the work of H L Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination \n but it did not have the same impact Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to \n IQ \n -type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down \n \"Four C\" model \n James C Kaufman \n and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity \n mini-c \n \"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights\" \n little-c \n everyday problem solving and creative expression \n Pro-C \n exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and \n Big-C \n creativity considered great in the given field This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity It also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals \n The contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used Kozbelt Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity \n Margaret Boden \n distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal \n Robinson \n and Anna Craft \n have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity \n and cites \n Ken Robinson \n as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity \n Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi \n has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain-changing contributions Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity \n Theories of creative processes \n There has been much empirical study in \n psychology \n and \n cognitive science \n of the processes through which creativity occurs Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity \n Incubation \n Incubation is a temporary break from \n creative problem solving \n that can result in insight \n There has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas' model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving Ward \n lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some \n empirical evidence \n is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become \n fixated \n on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem \n This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks \n This earlier hypothesis is discussed in \n Csikszentmihalyi \n 's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem \n Convergent and divergent thinking \n J P Guilford \n drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed \n convergent \n and \n divergent thinking \n Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature Other researchers have occasionally used the terms \n flexible \n thinking or \n fluid intelligence \n which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity \n citation needed \n Creative cognition approach \n In Finke et al proposed the \"Geneplore\" model in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts \n Weisberg \n argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results \n The ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory \n Helie and Sun \n recently proposed a unified framework for understanding \n creativity in problem solving \n namely the ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory of creativity This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of \n incubation \n and \n insight \n The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely \n The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge \n The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks \n The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge \n The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing \n The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing \n A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the \n CLARION cognitive architecture \n and used to simulate relevant human data This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena \n Conceptual blending \n Conceptual blending \n In \n The Act of Creation \n Arthur Koestler \n introduced the concept of \n bisociation \n that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference \n This idea was later developed into conceptual blending In the 1990s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with \n metaphor \n analogy \n and \n structure mapping \n have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label \n conceptual blending \n Honing theory \n Honing theory developed principally by psychologist \n Liane Gabora \n posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self-mending nature of a worldview The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process When faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the worldview changes through interaction with the task This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only is the task conceived of differently but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge \n A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state \n Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task Thus the creative idea may feel half-baked It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with \n Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization However research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing \n Everyday imaginative thought \n In everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only \" \n Their \n counterfactual thinking \n is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes \n It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought \n Assessing individual creative ability \n Creativity quotient \n Several attempts have been made to develop a \n creativity quotient \n of an individual similar to the \n intelligence quotient \n IQ however these have been unsuccessful \n Psychometric approach \n J P Guilford \n 's group \n which pioneered the modern \n psychometric \n study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in \n Plot Titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles \n Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness \n Figure Concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommonness \n Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks \n Remote Associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e g Hand Call \n Remote Consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e g loss of gravity \n Building on Guilford's work \n Torrance \n developed the \n Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \n in \n They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on \n Fluency \n The total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus \n Originality \n The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects \n Elaboration \n The amount of detail in the responses \n The \n Creativity Achievement Questionnaire \n a self-report test that measures creative achievement across domains was described in and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output \n Such tests sometimes called \n Divergent Thinking DT \n tests have been both supported \n and criticized \n Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of \n divergent thinking \n tests using semantic approach When compared to human raters \n NLP \n techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality when compared to human raters \n The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of and respectively to human graders \n Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures \n Most recently an NSF-funded \n team of researchers led by \n James C Kaufman \n and Mark A Runco \n combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system This system enabled automated scoring of \n DT \n tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of \n DT \n tests that had been found and reported \n The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of to human graders \n Social-personality approach \n Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity In these studies personality traits such as independence of judgement self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals \n A \n meta-analysis \n by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self-accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive \" Openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed \n Within the framework of the \n Big Five \n model of personality some consistent traits have emerged \n Openness to experience \n has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity \n Among the other Big Five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity Compared to non-artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience \n conscientious \n and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists \n Creativity and intelligence \n The potential relationship between creativity and \n intelligence \n has been of interest since the late 1900s when a multitude of influential studies from Getzels & Jackson \n Barron \n Wallach & Kogan \n and Guilford \n focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why \n There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the main theories as follows \n Threshold Theory Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120 \n Certification Theory Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence Instead individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence \n Interference Theory Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability \n Sternberg and OHara \n proposed a framework of possible relationships between creativity and intelligence \n Creativity is a subset of intelligence \n Intelligence is a subset of creativity \n Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs \n Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets \n Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets \n Creativity as a subset of intelligence \n A number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence \n Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence \n Gardners \n Theory of multiple intelligences \n MIT \n implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT To demonstrate this Gardner cited examples of different famous creators each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e g Picasso spatial intelligence Freud intrapersonal Einstein logical-mathematical and Gandhi interpersonal \n Sternbergs Theory of Successful intelligence \n see \n Triarchic theory of intelligence \n includes creativity as a main component and comprises sub-theories Componential Analytic Contextual Practical and Experiential Creative Experiential sub-theory the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems is directly related to creativity \n The \n CattellHornCarroll theory \n includes creativity as a subset of intelligence Specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include \n ideational fluency associational fluency and originality/creativity Silvia et al \n conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor Martindale \n extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased \n The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence \n posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence Type is a conscious process and concerns goal directed thoughts which are explained by \n g \n Type is an unconscious process and concerns spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type and Type processes working together in combination The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees \n Intelligence as a subset of creativity \n In this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity \n Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity \n Sternberg & Lubarts Investment Theory \n Using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors they buy low and sell high in their ideas Like under/low-valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people The creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value After convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people and moves onto generating another idea According to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence knowledge thinking styles personality motivation and environment Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts \n Amabiles Componential Model of Creativity \n In this model there are within-individual components needed for creativity domain-relevant skills creativity-relevant processes and task motivation and component external to the individual their surrounding social environment Creativity requires a confluence of all components High creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment \n Amusement Park Theoretical Model \n In this 4-step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role \n To get into the amusement park there are initial requirements e g time/transport to go to the park Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity They are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour \n Secondly are the subcomponents general thematic areas that increase in specificity Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e g a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e g poetry \n Thirdly there are specific domains After choosing the type of park to visit e g waterpark you then have to choose which specific park to go to Within the poetry domain there are many different types e g free verse riddles sonnet etc that have to be selected from \n Lastly there are micro-domains These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e g individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark \n Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs \n This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs \n Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs \n Renzullis Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness \n In this conceptualisation giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment Under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions \n PASS theory of intelligence \n In this theory the planning component relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity \n Threshold Theory TT A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120 Above this threshold of an IQ of if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak \n TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity \n In support of the TT Barron \n reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample Yamamoto \n in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of \n r \n = and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children Fuchs-Beauchamp et al \n in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from \n r \n = to \n r \n = in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold the correlations were \n r \n = < Cho et al \n reported a correlation of between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults and a correlation of close to \n r \n = for the high IQ group Jauk et al \n found support for the TT but only for measures of creative potential not creative performance \n Much modern day research reports findings against TT Wai et al \n in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood found that differences in SAT scores at age were predictive of creative real-life outcomes years later Kims \n meta-analysis of studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of Preckel et al \n investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of \n r \n = to \n r \n = across all levels of cognitive ability \n Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets \n Under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity Thus creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing Perkins \n referred to this as the nothing-special view \n Weisberg & Alba \n examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem see \n Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle \n where the participants are asked to connect all dots in the rows of dots using straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required \n Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets \n In this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs \n Getzels and Jackson \n administered creativity measures to a group of children from grades 6-12 and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was \n r \n = The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers The high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20% for IQ but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated \n However this work has been heavily criticised Wallach and Kogan \n highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills McNemar \n noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from different IQ tests \n Wallach and Kogan \n administered measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and measures of general intelligence to 5th grade children These tests were untimed and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average \n r \n = Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average \n r \n = with each other Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated \n r \n = \n Neuroscience \n The \n neuroscience \n of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour It has been addressed \n in the article \"Creative Innovation Possible Brain Mechanisms \" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected \" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways \n they have a high level of specialized knowledge \n they are capable of \n divergent thinking \n mediated by the \n frontal lobe \n and they are able to modulate \n neurotransmitters \n such as \n norepinephrine \n in their frontal lobe \n Thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the \n cortex \n that is most important for creativity \n This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep \n mood \n and \n addiction disorders \n and \n depression \n In Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive Drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the \n temporal lobes \n and \n dopamine \n from the \n limbic system \n The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa High dopamine levels increase general \n arousal \n and goal directed behaviors and reduce \n latent inhibition \n and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas \n A study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other \n default mode network \n functions \n Working memory and the cerebellum \n Vandervert \n described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the \n cerebellum \n collaborate to produce creativity and innovation Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of \n working memory \n responsible for processing all thought \n are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum \n The cerebellum consisting of billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain \n is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes \n where creative and innovative thoughts arise \n Apparently creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe \n According to Vandervert the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC \n New hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion \n Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the \n child prodigy \n and thought in general \n Essentially Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem \n Most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans \n Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimizes efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology \n Prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself Further Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the \n Khan Academy \n The model proposed by Vandervert has however received incisive critique from several authors \n REM sleep \n Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement Sleep aids this process \n REM \n rather than \n NREM sleep \n appears to be responsible \n This has been suggested to be due to changes in \n cholinergic \n and \n noradrenergic \n neuromodulation \n that occurs during REM sleep \n During this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the \n hippocampus \n suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the \n neocortex \n and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus \n This is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes \" \n Affect \n Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence As noted in \n voting behavior \n the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making \n Positive affect relations \n According to \n Alice Isen \n positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity \n Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association \n Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem \n Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated Together these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity \n Barbara Fredrickson \n in her \n broaden-and-build \n model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity \n According to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope \n Various meta-analyses such as Baas et al of studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect \n Creativity and artificial intelligence \n Jrgen Schmidhuber \n 's formal \n theory \n of creativity \n postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple \n computational \n principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own \n sensory \n inputs The agent can use a \n black box \n optimization method such as \n reinforcement learning \n to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future \n reward \n signals There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry But Schmidhuber's \n objective function \n to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects \" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals A wow-effect is formally defined as follows As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an \n artificial neural network \n or some other \n machine learning \n device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time The improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in \n data compression \n or computational speed It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects Irregular random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress and thus are \"boring\" by nature providing no reward Already known and predictable regularities also are boring Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations This motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration \n According to Schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and \n comedians \n For example \n physicists \n are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished \n physical laws \n permitting better \n data compression \n Likewise composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements Similarly a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected \n punch line \n related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data \" \n Schmidhuber argues that ongoing \n computer hardware \n advances will greatly scale up rudimentary \n artificial \n scientists and artists \n clarification needed \n based on simple implementations of the basic principle since \n He used the theory to create \n low-complexity art \n and an attractive \n human face \n Mental health \n Creativity and mental illness \n A study by psychologist \n J Philippe Rushton \n found creativity to correlate with \n intelligence \n and \n psychoticism \n Another study found creativity to be greater in \n schizotypal \n than in either normal or \n schizophrenic \n individuals While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the \n prefrontal cortex \n schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their \n right \n prefrontal cortex \n This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate In agreement with this hypothesis \n ambidexterity \n is also associated with \n schizotypal \n and \n schizophrenic \n individuals Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal \n and hypomanic personality \n and several different measures of creativity \n Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and \n mood disorders \n particularly \n manic-depressive disorder \n a k a \n bipolar disorder \n and \n depressive disorder \n a k a \n unipolar disorder \n In \n Touched with Fire Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament \n Kay Redfield Jamison \n summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in \n writers \n poets \n and \n artists \n She also explores research that identifies \n mood disorders \n in such famous writers and artists as \n Ernest Hemingway \n who shot himself after \n electroconvulsive treatment \n Virginia Woolf \n who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer \n Robert Schumann \n who died in a mental institution and even the famed \n visual artist \n Michelangelo \n A study looking at persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder There was no overall overrepresentation but overrepresentation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives \n Another study involving more than one million people conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder \n However as a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports \n According to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress \n Creativity and personality \n Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth innovation speed etc These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals \n i \n Incubate \n Long-term Development \n ii \n Imagine \n Breakthrough Ideas \n iii \n Improve \n Incremental Adjustments \n iv \n Invest \n Short-term Goals \n Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at \n Manchester Business School \n has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each \n i \"Idea Generation\" Fluency Originality Incubation and Illumination \n ii \"Personality\" Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity \n iii \"Motivation\" Intrinsic Extrinsic and Achievement \n iv \"Confidence\" Producing Sharing and Implementing \n This model was developed in a sample of working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling \n An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterised by the \n psychometric \n approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference \n One characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called \n divergent production \n Divergent production \n is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation \n One way of measuring \n divergent production \n is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \n The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions \n Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways In a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects \n The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person Motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people \n From a personality-traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people \n Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self-accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity \n From an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas As ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments As a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society \n In studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found Creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non-nurturing Most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination \n Another theory of creative people is the \n investment theory of creativity \n This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity In the \n investment \n sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea Just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected This \n investment theory of creativity \n views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way \n Malevolent creativity \n Malevolent creativity MC focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity \n This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism However MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal \n Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving The personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC \n Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions They concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individuals expression of malevolent creativity \n The current measure for malevolent creativity is the item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale MCBS \n Malevolent creativity and crime \n Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime As creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime \n Creativity across cultures \n Creativity is viewed differently in different countries \n For example cross-cultural research centred on \n Hong Kong \n found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e g what they can contribute to society \n Mpofu et al surveyed African languages and found that had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' the exception being \n Arabic \n The principle of \n linguistic relativity \n i e that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages However more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative \n Africa \n has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as \n music \n art \n and \n storytelling \n Nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa \n and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America \n Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity For example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges \n while in Germany creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems \n In organizations \n Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in \n Brazil \n The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity \n It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent For any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands Thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes \n Amabile \n argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed \n Expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledge \n Creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems \n and Motivation especially \n intrinsic motivation \n There are two types of motivation \n extrinsic motivation \n external \n factors for example \n threats \n of being fired or money as a reward \n intrinsic motivation \n comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc \n Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are \n Challenge matching people with the right assignments \n Freedom giving people \n autonomy \n choosing means to achieve goals \n Resources \n such as time money space etc There must be balance fit among resources and people \n Work group features \n diverse \n supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each other's talents \n Supervisory \n encouragement recognitions cheering praising \n Organizational support value emphasis information sharing \n collaboration \n Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations \n In particular he emphasized the role that \n tacit knowledge \n has to play in the creative process \n In business \n originality \n is not enough The idea must also be appropriateuseful and \n actionable \n Creative competitive intelligence \n is a new solution to solve this problem According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to \n innovation \n process and \n competitive intelligence \n to creative workers \n Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace It is essential for innovation and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses In the sociologist Silvia Leal Martn using the Innova 3DX method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear \n Similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation \n The investigation by Loo \n on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page It offers connections with the sections on the Four C model Theories of creative processes Creativity as a subset of intelligence Creativity and personality and In organisations It is the last section that the investigation addresses \n Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels macro meso and micro Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension Meso studies focus on organisations Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses e g Burton-Jones Drucker economics e g Cortada Reich Florida education e g Farrell and Fenwick Brown Lauder and Ashton human resource management e g Davenport knowledge and organizational management Alvesson Defillippi Arthur and Lindsay Orr Nutley Russell Bain Hacking and Moran sociology psychology and knowledge economy-related sectors especially information technology IT software e g ORiain Nerland and advertising e g Grabher Lury Loo \n Loo studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives Specifically the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising and systems software developing and software programme managing \n The study offers a conceptual framework Loo p of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles and single and multi-contexts The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics e g Reich Quah management e g Drucker Nonaka and Takeuchi von Hippel sociology e g Zuboff Bell Lash and Urry Castells Knorr Cetina and psychology e g Gardner Csikszentmihalyi Sternberg Kaufman and Pretz The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work These workers apply their cognitive abilities creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science technology or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities e g a medium product or service These work activities may be done individually or collectively Education training and encultured environments are necessary for the performance of these creative activities Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner and creating something that is different and novel i e a variation on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives \n This investigation identifies a definition of creative work three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination problem-solving problem seeking and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example for a creative director in the advertising industry it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector In addition to the creative applications creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles Passion for ones job is generic For copywriters this passion is identified with fun enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product confidence and patience in finding the appropriate copy Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities e g literature the creative arts e g painting and music and technical-related know-how e g mathematics computer sciences and physical sciences In the IT software technical knowledge of computer languages e g C+++ is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers \n There are three types of work One is intra-sectoral e g general sponge and in tune with the zeitgeist advertising and power of expression and sensitivity IT software The second is inter-sectoral e g integration of advertising activities advertising and autonomous decentralized systems ADS IT software The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors e g three-dimensional trust and green credentials advertising and collaboration with HEIs and industry and ADS system in the Tokyo train operator IT software \n The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information communications and electronic technologies ICET infrastructure training work environment and education \n This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure delivery approaches and assessments At a macro level governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally and foster an environment which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation \n Team Composition \n Diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways However under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives \n Thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity \n Team Processes \n Team communication \n norms \n such as respecting others expertise paying attention to others ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements \n negotiating \n remaining open to others ideas learning from others and building on each others ideas increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with \n brainstorming \n and \n problem solving \n Through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team \n affect \n which facilitates collective creativity \n Organizational Culture \n Supportive and motivational environments that create \n psychological safety \n by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well \n Organizations in which \n help-seeking \n help giving \n and \n collaboration \n are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur \n Additionally \n leadership styles \n that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity \n Economic views of creativity \n Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modelling markets for creativity and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation \n In the early 20th century \n Joseph Schumpeter \n introduced the economic theory of \n creative destruction \n to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new Some economists such as \n Paul Romer \n view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth Creativity leads to \n capital \n and creative products are protected by \n intellectual property \n laws \n Mark A Runco \n and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \" \n psychoeconomic \n \" model of creativity \n In such a model creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive \n utility \n and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations \n The \n creative class \n is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies In his book \n The Rise of the Creative Class \n economist \n Richard Florida \n popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development Technology Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of \n creative professionals \n and tend to have a higher level of economic development \n Fostering creativity \n Creativity techniques \n Daniel Pink in his book \n A Whole New Mind \n repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important In this \n conceptual age \n we will need to foster and encourage \n right-directed thinking \n representing creativity and emotion over \n left-directed thinking \n representing logical analytical thought However this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data \n Nickerson \n provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry \n Establishing purpose and intention \n Building basic skills \n Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge \n Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration \n Building motivation especially internal motivation \n Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks \n Focusing on mastery and self-competition \n Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity \n Providing opportunities for choice and discovery \n Developing self-management metacognitive skills \n Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance \n Providing balance \n Some see the conventional system of \n schooling \n as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt particularly in the \n preschool \n / \n kindergarten \n and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly rich imagination-fostering environment for young children \n Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise \n In addition to helping with problem solving creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so \n See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought \n Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake \n To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks \n Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it \n Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual Such ideas range from the \n psychological \n -cognitive such as \n Osborn \n - \n Parnes \n Creative Problem Solving Process \n Synectics \n science-based creative thinking Purdue Creative Thinking Program and \n Edward de Bono \n 's \n lateral thinking \n to the highly structured such as \n TRIZ \n the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist \n Genrich Altshuller \n and Computer-Aided \n morphological analysis \n Creativity has also been identified as one of the key \n 21st century skills \n and as one of the \n Four Cs of 21st century learning \n by educational leaders and theorists in the United States \n List of academic journals addressing creativity \n Creativity Research Journal \n Creativity Theories Research - Applications \n International Journal of

Tradition \n Bronze \n tympanum \n over the main entrance Library of Congress \n Thomas Jefferson Building \n Washington D C \n A \n tradition \n is a \n belief \n or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past \n Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes like \n lawyers' wigs \n or military officers' \n spurs \n but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \"tradition\" itself derives from the \n Latin \n tradere \n literally meaning to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history many traditions have been invented on purpose whether that be political or cultural over short periods of time Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways \n One way tradition is used more simply often in academic work but elsewhere also is to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed The phrase \"according to tradition \" or \"by tradition \" usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition but is not supported and perhaps may be refuted by physical documentation by a physical artifact or other quality evidence For example \"According to tradition Homer was born on Chios but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs \" This tradition may never be proven or disproven In another example \" \n King Arthur \n by tradition a true British king has inspired many well loved stories \" Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature \n Aside from this use in describing the quality of information various scholarly fields define the term differently as is needed For example \n anthropology \n and \n biology \n have each defined tradition it more precisely than in conventional as described below in order to facilitate scholarly discourse \n The concept of tradition as the notion of holding on to a previous time is also found in political and philosophical discourse For example it is the basis of the political concept of \n traditionalism \n and also strands of many world religions including \n traditional Catholicism \n In artistic contexts tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form For example in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences A number of factors can exacerbate the \n loss of tradition \n including industrialization \n globalization \n and the assimilation or \n marginalization \n of specific cultural groups In response to this tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world focusing on aspects such as traditional languages Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of \n modernity \n and should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts \n Definition \n Invention of tradition \n In scholarly discourse \n Anthropology \n Archaeology \n Biology \n Musicology and ethnomusicology \n Sociology \n Philosophy \n In political and religious discourse \n In artistic discourse \n Relationship to other concepts \n Preservation \n Traditional cultural expressions \n Citations \n Works cited \n Further reading \n Definition \n Textual traditions \n of bound manuscripts of the \n Sefer Torah \n Torah scroll are passed down providing additional \n vowel points \n pronunciation marks \n and \n stress accents \n in the authentic \n Masoretic Text \n of the \n Jewish Bible \n often the basis for translations of the Christian Old Testament \n The English word \"tradition\" comes from the \n Latin \n traditio \n the noun from the verb \n tradere \n to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping it was originally used in \n Roman law \n to refer to the concept of legal transfers and \n inheritance \n According to \n Anthony Giddens \n and others the modern meaning of tradition can be seen as having evolved in the European discourse in the last two hundred years during the \n Enlightenment \n period as philosophers and thinkers counter posed the concept of modernity with the concept of tradition in the context of \n progress \n As with many other generic terms there are many definitions of tradition \n The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs objects or customs performed or believed in the past originating in it transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next and are performed or believed in the present \n Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are \n Prehistoric \n with lost or \n arcane \n origins existing from \n time immemorial \n Originally traditions were passed orally without the need for a \n writing system \n Tools to aid this process include \n poetic devices \n such as \n rhyme \n and \n alliteration \n The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition or as part of an \n oral tradition \n Even such traditions however are presumed to have originated been \"invented\" by humans at some point \n Traditions are often presumed to be \n ancient \n unalterable and deeply important though they may sometimes be much less \"natural\" than is presumed \n It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three \n generations \n are required for a practice belief or object to be seen as traditional \n Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution \n Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition \n Tradition changes slowly with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant \n Thus those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations it will be seen as unchanged \n There are various origins and fields of tradition they can refer to \n the forms of artistic heritage of a particular culture \n beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments such as \n national anthems \n and \n national holidays \n such as \n Federal holidays in the United States \n beliefs or customs maintained by \n religious denominations \n and \n church bodies \n that share history customs culture and to some extent body of teachings \n For example one can speak of Islam's tradition or Christianity's tradition \n Many objects beliefs and customs can be traditional \n Rituals of \n social interaction \n can be traditional with phrases and gestures such as saying \"thank you\" sending \n birth announcements \n greeting cards \n etc \n Tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups family traditions at Christmas \n organizations company's \n picnic \n or societies such as the practice of national and public holidays \n Some of the oldest traditions include \n monotheism \n three millennia and \n citizenship \n two millennia \n It can also include material objects such as buildings works of art or tools \n Tradition is often used as an \n adjective \n in contexts such as \n traditional music \n traditional medicine \n traditional values \n and others \n In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context passed through generations \n Invention of tradition \n Invented tradition \n The term \" \n invention of tradition \n \" introduced by \n E J Hobsbawm \n refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present \n A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal commercial political or \n national self-interest \n as was done in colonial Africa or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event rather than developing and spreading organically in a population as in the case of the white \n wedding dress \n which only became popular after \n Queen Victoria \n wore a white gown at her wedding to \n Albert of Saxe-Coburg \n An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the \n Palace of Westminster \n location of the \n British Parliament \n in the \n Gothic style \n Similarly most of the traditions associated with \n monarchy of the United Kingdom \n seen as rooted deep in history actually date to 19th century \n Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces \n Requiring \n legitimacy \n the \n colonial power \n would often invent a \"tradition\" which they could use to legitimize their own position For example a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition but were exaggerated distorted or biased toward a particular interpretation \n Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by \n nationalism \n Common examples include public holidays particularly those unique to a particular nation the singing of national anthems and traditional national cuisine see \n national dish \n Expatriate \n and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation \n In scholarly discourse \n In science tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field \n In philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a \"rational theory of tradition\" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological For Popper each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it \n Unlike \n myth \n which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates who proposed critical discussion according to Popper \n For \n Thomas Kuhn \n who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is historically what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embrasure of tradition \n Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in \n social sciences \n chiefly anthropology \n archeology \n and biologywith somewhat different meanings in different fields It is also used in varying contexts in other fields such as history \n psychology \n and \n sociology \n Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis In the 1970s and 1980s \n Edward Shils \n explored the concept in detail \n Since then a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition meanwhile \"tradition\" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals \n Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions perspectives approaches in those disciplines \n Anthropology \n Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology it can be said that anthropology is the study of \"tradition in traditional societies\" \n There is however no \"theory of tradition\" as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary as defining tradition is both unnecessary everyone can be expected to know what it is and unimportant as small differences in definition would be just technical \n There are however dissenting views scholars such as \n Pascal Boyer \n argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline \n Archaeology \n In \n archaeology \n the term \n tradition \n is a set of \n cultures \n or \n industries \n which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time The term is especially common in the study of \n American archaeology \n Biology \n Biologists when examining groups of non-humans have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next Tradition is defined in biology as \"a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring i e is performed repeatedly over a period of time that is shared among two or more members of a group that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners\" and has been called a precursor to \"culture\" in the anthropological sense \n Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish birds and mammals Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees in particular may display large numbers of behavioral traditions and in chimpanzees transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another not just within a group has been observed Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change \n Musicology and ethnomusicology \n Amar Rabbi Elazar \n A traditional setting of the last passage of the first tractate \n Berakhot \n of the \n Oral Torah \n which describes how scholars of the Talmud create peace in the world Performed by \n Cantor \n Meyer Kanewsky in for \n Edison Records \n Problems playing this file? See \n media help \n In the field of \n musicology \n and \n ethnomusicology \n tradition refers to the belief systems repertoire techniques style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns Along with a sense of history traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music' \n they differ in their methodology and subject of research 'Tradition or traditions can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective ' \n Sociology \n The concept of tradition in early sociological research around the turn of the 19th and 20th century referred to that of the \n traditional society \n as contrasted by the more modern \n industrial society \n This approach was most notably portrayed in \n Max Weber \n 's concepts of \n traditional authority \n and modern \n rational-legal authority \n In more modern works One hundred years later sociology sees tradition as a \n social construct \n used to contrast past with the present and as a form of \n rationality \n used to justify certain course of action \n Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business \n division of labor \n influenced primarily by age gender and status high position of custom in the system of values self-sufficiency preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment relative \n autarky \n Early theories positing the simple \n unilineal evolution \n of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic \n In Edward Shils in his book \n Tradition \n put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted \n According to Shils tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present \n Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality It is also related to the works of Max Weber see \n theories of rationality \n and were popularized and redefined in by \n Raymond Boudon \n in his book \n Action \n In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as \"it has always been that way\" \n This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the \n appeal to tradition \n or \n argumentum ad antiquitatem \n which takes the form \"this is right because we've always done it this way \" \n In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the \"tradition\" being advocated may no longer be desirable or indeed may never have been despite its previous popularity \n Philosophy \n The idea of tradition is important in philosophy Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries and a 'continental' tradition dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents following \n Martin Heidegger \n call 'the tradition' which began with \n Plato \n and \n Aristotle \n In contrast some continental philosophers - most notably \n Hans-Georg Gadamer \n - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of \n Aristotelianism \n This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by \n Alasdair MacIntyre \n However MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition' instead posing \n Aristotelianism \n as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others \n In political and religious discourse \n Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal decor with \n Christmas tree \n a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century \n Main articles \n Traditional values \n and \n Traditionalist conservatism \n The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values \n Similarly strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition For example the term \" \n traditionalist Catholic \n \" refers to those such as \n Archbishop Lefebvre \n who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the \n Second Vatican Council \n of \n Likewise \n Sunni Muslims \n are referred to as \n Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamah \n Arabic \n literally \"people of the tradition of \n Muhammad \n and the community\" emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition \n More generally tradition has been used as a way of determining the \n political spectrum \n with \n right-wing \n parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than \n left-wing \n ones \n citation needed \n Here the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism or simply \n traditionalism \n which emphasizes the need for the principles of \n natural law \n and transcendent moral order \n hierarchy \n and \n organic unity \n agrarianism \n classicism \n and \n high culture \n and the intersecting spheres of loyalty \n Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of \n individualism \n liberalism modernity and \n social progress \n but promote cultural and educational renewal \n and revive interest in the church the family the state and local community This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable for example stereotypical views of the \n place of women in domestic affairs \n In other societies especially ones experiencing rapid social change the idea of what is \"traditional\" may be widely contested with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society in other cases tradition is a means of \n othering \n and keeping groups distinct from one another \n In artistic discourse \n In artistic contexts in the performance of traditional genres such as \n traditional dance \n adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences \n It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional \n For artistic endeavors tradition has been used as a contrast to \n creativity \n with traditional and \n folk art \n associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition in contrast to \n fine art \n which is valued for being original and unique More recent philosophy of art however considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression \n Relationship to other concepts \n In the social sciences \n tradition \n is often contrasted with \n modernity \n particularly in terms of whole societies This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern \n Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing \n filial piety \n harmony and group welfare stability and \n interdependence \n while a society exhibiting modernity would value \"individualism with free will and choice mobility and progress \" \n Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity Anthony Giddens sees tradition as something bound to ritual where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition \n Gusfield and others though criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified arguing that tradition is dynamic heterogeneous and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals \n Tradition should be differentiated from \n customs \n conventions \n laws \n norms \n routines rules \n and similar concepts Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change \n Whereas justification for tradition is \n ideological \n the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical \n Over time customs routines conventions rules and such can evolve into traditions but that usually requires that they stop having primarily a practical purpose \n For example wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable \n spurs \n worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional \n Preservation \n Woman welcoming the \n Shabbat \n a more than years old tradition \n In many countries concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization \n globalization \n and the \n assimilation \n or \n marginalization \n of specific cultural groups \n Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved \n Likewise the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as \n Cornish \n under the auspices of the \n European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages \n Specifically the charter holds that these languages \"contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions\" The Charter goes on to call for \"the use or adoption of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages\" \n Similarly \n UNESCO \n includes both \"oral tradition\" and \"traditional manifestations\" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage It therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil \n In \n Japan \n certain artworks structures craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties \n This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as \" \n National Living Treasures \n \" and encourages the preservation of their craft \n For native peoples like the \n Mori \n in New Zealand there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition \n Traditional cultural expressions \n The phrase \"traditional cultural expressions\" is used by the \n World Intellectual Property Organization \n to refer to \"any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied They are transmitted from one generation to the next and include handmade textiles paintings stories legends ceremonies music songs rhythms and dance \" \n Aition \n Folklore \n Look up \n tradition \n in Wiktionary the free dictionary \n Perennial philosophy"},

{"theme.id": 9, "title": "Conformity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity", "depth": 0, "text": "Conformity \n Conformity \n is the act of matching attitudes beliefs and behaviors to group \n norms \n Norms are implicit specific rules shared by a group of individuals that guide their interactions with others This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole and may result from subtle unconscious influences or direct and overt \n social pressure \n Conformity can occur in the presence of others or when an individual is alone For example people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television even when alone \n People often conform from a desire for security within a grouptypically a group of a similar age culture religion or educational status This is often referred to as \n groupthink \n a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception forced manufacture of consent and conformity to group values and ethics which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of \n social rejection \n Conformity is often associated with adolescence and \n youth culture \n but strongly affects humans of all ages \n Although \n peer pressure \n may manifest negatively conformity can be regarded as either good or bad Driving on the correct side of the road could be seen as beneficial conformity \n With the right environmental influence conforming in early childhood years allows one to learn and thus adopt the appropriate behaviours necessary to interact and develop correctly within one's society \n Conformity influences formation and maintenance of \n social norms \n and helps societies function smoothly and predictably via the self-elimination of behaviors seen as contrary to unwritten rules In this sense it can be perceived as a positive force that prevents acts that are perceptually disruptive or dangerous \n As conformity is a \n group \n phenomenon factors such as group size unanimity cohesion \n status \n prior commitment and \n public opinion \n help determine the level of conformity an individual displays \n Peer \n Social responses \n Main experiments \n Sherif's experiment \n Asch's experiment \n Varieties \n Informational influence \n Normative influence \n Minority influence \n Specific predictors \n Culture \n Gender \n Age \n Size of the group \n Different stimuli \n Neural correlates \n Peer \n Some adolescents gain acceptance and recognition from their peers by conformity This peer moderated conformity increases from the transition of childhood to adolescence \n Social responses \n According to Donelson Forsyth after submitting to group pressures individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement \n When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus they are experiencing \n compliance \n or \n acquiescence \n In turn \n conversion \n otherwise known as \n private acceptance \n involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision Thus this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority \n Another type of social response which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group is called \n convergence \n In this type of social response the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand \n In addition Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories Firstly an individual who does not conform to the majority can display \n independence \n Independence \n or \n dissent \n can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures Thus this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards Secondly a nonconformist could be displaying \n anticonformity \n or \n counterconformity \n which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion \n To conclude social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity For example a popular experiment in conformity research known as the \n Asch situation \n or \n Asch conformity experiments \n primarily includes \n compliance \n and \n independence \n Also other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries sports teams and work teams \n Main experiments \n Sherif's experiment \n Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group In his experiment participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light feet away They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved The trick was there was no movement it was caused by a visual illusion known as the \n autokinetic effect \n On the first day each person perceived different amounts of movement but from the second to the fourth day the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it \n Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society providing a common frame of reference for people \n Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations In an eyewitness identification task participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects They were given one second to identify him making it a difficult task One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community To the other it was simply a trial Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group \n Asch's experiment \n Asch conformity experiments \n Which line matches the first line A B or C? In the \n Asch conformity experiments \n people frequently followed the majority judgment even when the majority was wrong \n Solomon E Asch conducted a modification of Sherifs study assuming that when the situation was very clear conformity would be drastically reduced He exposed people in a group to a series of lines and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in of the trials \n The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial On average people conformed one third of the time \n A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious \n After his first test Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects \"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to persons \" \n The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject the subject became more likely to conform However the increasing majority was only influential up to a point from three or more opponents there is more than 30% of conformity \n Varieties \n Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three major types of conformity \n Compliance \n is public conformity while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected \n Identification \n is conforming to someone who is liked and respected such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source \n and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance \n Internalization \n is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately if the source is credible It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time \n Although Kelman's distinction has been influential research in \n social psychology \n has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity These are \n informational \n conformity or \n informational social influence \n and \n normative \n conformity also called \n normative social influence \n In Kelman's terminology these correspond to internalization and compliance respectively There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human \n psychology \n and conformity the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context \n For Deutsch and Grard conformity results from a motivational conflict between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct that leads to the normative influence and a cognitive conflict others create doubts in what we think which leads to the informational influence \n Informational influence \n Informational social influence \n Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations when a situation is ambiguous people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary in spite of panic Looking to other people can help ease fears but unfortunately they are not always right The more knowledgeable a person is the more valuable they are as a resource Thus people often turn to \n experts \n for help But once again people must be careful as experts can make mistakes too Informational social influence often results in \n internalization \n or \n private acceptance \n where a person genuinely believes that the information is right \n Normative influence \n Normative social influence \n Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans \n In addition to this we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants they are less liked and even punished by the group \n Normative influence usually results in \n public compliance \n doing or saying something without believing in it The experiment of Asch in is one example of normative influence \n In a reinterpretation of the original data from these \n experiments \n Hodges and Geyer \n found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants They include truth i e expressing one's own view accurately trust i e taking seriously the value of others' claims and social solidarity i e a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either In addition to these epistemic values there are multiple moral claims as well These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants the experimenter themselves and the worth of scientific research \n Deutsch & Grard designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately they were giving the correct one \n Normative influence a function of \n social impact theory \n has three components \n The \n number of people \n in the group has a surprising effect As the number increases each person has less of an impact A group's \n strength \n is how important the group is to a person Groups we value generally have more social influence \n Immediacy \n is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy \n Baron and his colleagues conducted a second \n eyewitness study \n that focused on normative influence In this version the task was easier Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second Once again there were both high and low motives to be accurate but the results were the reverse of the first study The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time similar to Asch's findings The high motivation group conformed less at 16% These results show that when accuracy is not very important it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval \n An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of \n friends \n as compared to six-person groups of strangers \n Because friends already know and accept each other there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse however generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other \n Minority influence \n Minority influence \n Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them This is known as \n minority influence \n a special case of informational influence Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty the chance of influence is small However a minority that makes a strong convincing case increases the probability of changing the majority's beliefs and behaviors \n Minority members who are perceived as experts are high in status or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed \n Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics A review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" an inconsiderate or negligent group member can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction \n Specific predictors \n Culture \n Stanley Milgram \n found that individuals in Norway from a collectivistic culture exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France from an individualistic culture \n Similarly Berry studied two different populations the Temne collectivists and the Inuit individualists and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task \n Bond and Smith compared studies in a meta-analysis and found that Japan and Brazil were two nations that conformed a lot whereas Europe and the United States of America did not as much \n Bond and Smith also reported that conformity has declined in the United States over time \n Gender \n Societal norms often establish gender differences and researchers have reported differences in the way men and women conform to social influence \n For example Alice Eagly and Linda Carli performed a meta-analysis of studies of influenceability They found that women are more persuadable and more conforming than men in group pressure situations that involve surveillance \n Eagly has proposed that this sex difference may be due to different sex roles in society \n Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent \n The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well In a study by Reitan and Shaw it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments \n Sistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias \n They argued that because stereotypes used in studies are generally male ones sports cars more than female ones cooking fashion women are feeling uncertain and conformed more which was confirmed by their results \n Age \n Research has noted age differences in conformity For example research with Australian children and adolescents ages to discovered that conformity decreases with age \n Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages to \n The results revealed a similar trend older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants \n In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status age has also been argued to have status implications Berger Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students Younger students such as those in their first year in college are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals \n Therefore given these status roles it would be expected that younger individuals low status conform to the majority whereas older individuals high status would be expected not to conform \n Researchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity \n Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age under years vs years and older gender and surveillance anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs not anticipating responses being shared on conformity to group opinions They discovered that among participants that were years or older females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance i e anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members However there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under years of age and in surveillance conditions There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance In a subsequent research article Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society She suggests that more submissive roles i e conforming are expected of individuals that hold low status roles \n Still Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals \n Size of the group \n Although conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number \n Moreover a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating \n This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong conformity will be motivated by normative influence the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response However conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response \n Different stimuli \n In Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines he conducted his study in Norway and France \n He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli and that in the case of tones there was a high degree of conformity \n Neural correlates \n Evidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex pMFC in conformity \n an area associated with memory and decision-making For example Klucharev et al \n revealed in their study that by using repetitive \n transcranial magnetic stimulation \n on the pMFC participants reduced their tendency to conform to the group suggesting a causal role for the brain region in social conformity In another study the mPFC was linked to \n normative social influence \n whilst the activity in the \n caudate \n was regarded as an index of \n informational influence \n The \n amygdala \n and \n hippocampus \n have also been found to be recruited when individuals participated in a social manipulation experiment involving long-term memory \n Several other areas have further been suggested to play a role in conformity including the \n insula \n the \n temporoparietal junction \n the \n ventral striatum \n and the anterior and posterior \n cingulate cortices \n More recent work \n stresses the role of \n orbitofrontal cortex \n OFC in conformity not only at the time of social influence \n but also later on when participants are given an opportunity to conform by selecting an action In particular Charpentier et al found that the OFC mirrors the exposure to social influence at a subsequent time point when a decision is being made without the social influence being present The tendency to conform has also been observed in the structure of the OFC with a greater \n grey matter \n volume in high conformers \n Psychology portal \n Sociology portal \n Authoritarian personality \n Countersignaling \n Cultural assimilation \n Milieu control \n

Classical methods and results \n Although other fields have studied obedience social psychology has been primarily responsible for the advancement of research on obedience It has been studied experimentally in several different ways \n Milgram's experiment \n In one classical study Stanley Milgram as part of the \n Milgram experiment \n created a highly controversial yet often replicated study Like many other experiments in psychology Milgram's setup involved \n deception \n of the participants In the experiment subjects were told they were going to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning In reality the experiment focuses on people's willingness to obey malevolent authority Each subject served as a teacher of associations between arbitrary pairs of words After meeting the \"teacher\" at the beginning of the experiment the \"learner\" an accomplice of the experimenter sat in another room and could be heard but not seen Teachers were told to give the \"learner\" electric shocks of increasing severity for each wrong answer If subjects questioned the procedure the \"researcher\" again an accomplice of Milgram would encourage them to continue Subjects were told to ignore the agonized screams of the learner his desire to be untied and stop the experiment and his pleas that his life was at risk and that he suffered from a heart condition The experiment the \"researcher\" insisted had to go on The \n dependent variable \n in this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered \n Zimbardo's experiment \n The other classical study on obedience was conducted at \n Stanford University \n during the 1970s \n Phillip Zimbardo \n was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment In the \n Stanford Prison Experiment \n college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior \n Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions here using \n random assignment \n half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\" \n Results \n The Milgram study found that most participants would obey orders even when obedience posed severe harm to others With encouragement from a perceived authority figure about two-thirds of the participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock to the learner This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that \"subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will\" \n Milgram attempted to explain how ordinary people were capable of performing potentially lethal acts against other human beings by suggesting that participants may have entered into an agentic state where they allowed the authority figure to take responsibility for their own actions \n Zimbardo obtained similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders and turned aggressive Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards The cruelty of the \"guards\" and the consequent stress of the \"prisoners \" forced Zimbardo to terminate the experiment prematurely after days \n Modern methods and results \n The previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience Milgram's study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community In a modern study Jerry Burger replicated Milgram's method with a few alterations Burger's method was identical to Milgram's except when the shocks reached volts participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended base condition To ensure the safety of the participants Burger added a two-step screening process this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment In the modeled refusal condition two confederates were used where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher The teacher stopped after going up to volts and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies' participants occurred after moving past volts Additionally since Milgram's study only used men Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions \n Using data from his previous study Burger probed participant's thoughts about obedience Participants' comments from the previous study were coded for the number of times they mentioned \"personal responsibility and the learner's well being\" \n The number of prods the participants used in the first experiment were also measured \n Another study that used a partial replication of Milgram's work changed the experimental setting In one of the Utrecht University studies on obedience participants were instructed to make a confederate who was taking an employment test feel uncomfortable Participants were told to make all of the instructed stress remarks to the confederate that ultimately made him fail in the experimental condition but in the control condition they were not told to make stressful remarks The dependent measurements were whether or not the participant made all of the stress remarks measuring absolute obedience and the number of stress remarks relative obedience \n Following the Utrecht studies another study used the stress remarks method to see how long participants would obey authority The dependent measures for this experiment were the number of stress remarks made and a separate measure of personality designed to measure individual differences \n Results \n Burger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time Additionally Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender In Burger's follow-up study he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue the more likely they were to stop the experiment The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task over 90% of them completed the experiment \n The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment called \"the foot in the door scenario\" \n In addition to the above studies additional research using participants from different cultures including Spain \n Australia \n and Jordan \n also found participants to be obedient \n Implications \n One of the major assumptions of obedience research is that the effect is caused only by the experimental conditions and \n Thomas Blass \n ' research contests this point as in some cases participant factors involving personality could potentially influence the results \n In one of Blass' reviews on obedience he found that participant's personalities can impact how they respond to authority \n as people that were high in authoritarian submission were more likely to obey \n He replicated this finding in his own research as in one of his experiments he found that when watching portions of the original Milgram studies on film participants placed less responsibility on those punishing the learner when they scored high on measures of authoritarianism \n In addition to personality factors participants who are resistant to obeying authority had high levels of \n social intelligence \n Other research \n Obedience can also be studied outside of the Milgram paradigm in fields such as economics or political science One economics study that compared obedience to a tax authority in the lab versus at home found that participants were much more likely to pay participation tax when confronted in the lab \n This finding implies that even outside of experimental settings people will forgo potential financial gain to obey authority \n Another study involving political science measured public opinion before and after a \n Supreme Court \n case debating whether or not states can legalize physician assisted suicide They found that participants' tendency to obey authorities was not as important to public opinion polling numbers as religious and moral beliefs \n Although prior research has demonstrated that the tendency to obey persists across settings this finding suggests that at personal factors like religion and morality can limit how much people obey authority \n Other experiments \n The Hofling hospital experiment \n Hofling hospital experiment \n Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in research settings In psychiatrist Charles K Hofling published the results of a \n field experiment \n on obedience in the nursephysician relationship in its natural hospital setting Nurses unaware they were taking part in an experiment were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a fictional drug to their patients Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances out of the nurses would have given the patient an overdose \n Cultural attitudes \n Doge's Palace \n in \n Venice \n capital featuring \n Virtues and vices \n - \n Obediencia D<omi>no exireo \n

\n June \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Main articles \n Socialization \n and \n Military training \n Some animals can easily be trained to be obedient by employing \n operant conditioning \n for example \n obedience schools \n exist to condition \n dogs \n to obey the orders of human owners \n Learning to obey adult rules is a major part of the \n socialization \n process in childhood and many techniques are used by adults to modify the behavior of children Additionally extensive training is given in armies to make soldiers capable of obeying orders in situations where an untrained person would not be willing to follow orders Soldiers are initially ordered to do seemingly trivial things such as picking up the sergeant's hat off the floor marching in just the right position or marching and standing in formation The orders gradually become more demanding until an order to the soldiers to place themselves into the midst of gunfire gets an instinctively obedient response \n Factors affecting obedience \n Embodiment of prestige or power \n Obedience occurs in several situations most often referred to is the obedience of soldiers to a superior officer \n When the Milgram experimenters were interviewing potential volunteers the participant selection process itself revealed several factors that affected obedience outside of the actual experiment \n Interviews for eligibility were conducted in an abandoned complex in \n Bridgeport \n Connecticut \n Despite the dilapidated state of the building the researchers found that the presence of a Yale professor as stipulated in the advertisement affected the number of people who obeyed This was not further researched to test obedience without a Yale professor because Milgram had not intentionally staged the interviews to discover factors that affected obedience \n A similar conclusion was reached in the \n Stanford prison experiment \n In the actual experiment \n prestige \n or the appearance of power was a direct factor in obedienceparticularly the presence of men dressed in gray \n laboratory coats \n which gave the impression of scholarship and achievement and was thought to be the main reason why people complied with administering what they thought was a painful or dangerous shock \n A similar conclusion was reached in the \n Stanford prison experiment \n Raj Persaud in an article in the BMJ \n comments on Milgram's attention to detail in his experiment \n The research was also conducted with amazing verve and subtletyfor example Milgram ensured that the \"experimenter\" wear a grey lab coat rather than a white one precisely because he did not want subjects to think that the \"experimenter\" was a medical doctor and thereby limit the implications of his findings to the power of physician authority \n Despite the fact that prestige is often thought of as a separate factor it is in fact merely a subset of power as a factor Thus the prestige conveyed by a Yale professor in a laboratory coat is only a manifestation of the experience and status associated with it and/or the social status afforded by such an image \n Agentic state and other factors \n According to Milgram \"the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person all of the essential features of obedience follow \" Thus \"the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter \" \n Besides this hypothetical agentic state Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject's obedience politeness awkwardness of withdrawal absorption in the technical aspects of the task the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human a belief that the experiment served a desirable end the sequential nature of the action and anxiety \n Belief perseverance \n Another explanation of Milgram's results invokes \n belief perseverance \n as the underlying cause What \"people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent Hence the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures \"' \n In humans \n Authority bias \n Belief perseverance \n Civil disobedience \n Codependency \n Conformity \n Depersonalization \n Dominance

discourse for example a referent may be a potential beneficiary or victim of a security policy or system \n Security referents may be persons or social groups objects institutions ecosystems or any other phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by the forces of its environment \n The referent in question may combine many referents in the same way that for example a nation state is composed of many individual citizens \n Context \n The security context is the relationships between a security referent and its environment \n From this perspective security and insecurity depend first on whether the environment is beneficial or hostile to the referent and also how capable is the referent of responding to its/their environment in order to survive and thrive \n Capabilities \n The means by which a referent provides for security or is provided for vary widely They include for example \n Coercive capabilities \n including the capacity to project coercive power into the environment e g

security e g \n economic \n reform \n ecological \n protection \n progressive demilitarization \n Effects \n Any action intended to provide security may have multiple effects For example an action may have wide benefit enhancing security for several or all security referents in the context alternatively the action may be effective only temporarily or benefit one referent at the expense of another or be entirely ineffective or counterproductive \n Contested approaches \n Approaches to security are contested and the subject of debate For example in debate about \n national security strategies \n some argue that security depends principally on developing protective and coercive capabilities in order to protect the security referent in a hostile environment and potentially to project that power into its environment and dominate it to the point of \n strategic supremacy \n Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships can develop partly by reducing antagonism between actors ensuring that fundamental needs can be met and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively \n Contexts of security examples \n The

to know with precision the extent to which something is 'secure' and a measure of vulnerability is unavoidable perceptions of security vary often greatly \n For example a fear of death by earthquake

{"theme.id": 10, "title": "Social order", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order", "depth": 0, "text": "Social order \n The term \n social order \n can be used in two senses In the first sense it refers to a particular set or system of linked \n social structures \n institutions \n relations customs values and practices which conserve maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving Examples are the ancient the feudal and the capitalist social order In the second sense social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members The \n problem of order \n or \n Hobbesian problem \n which is central to much of \n sociology \n political science \n and \n political philosophy \n is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all \n Sociology \n Principle of extensiveness \n Groups and networks \n Status groups \n Values and norms \n Power and authority \n Spontaneous order \n Social honor \n Attainment \n Further reading \n Sociology \n Thomas Hobbes \n is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem to answer which he conceived the notion of a \n social contract \n Social theorists \n such as \n Karl Marx \n mile Durkheim \n Talcott Parsons \n and \n Jrgen Habermas \n have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of and what its real basis is For Marx it is the \n relations of production \n or economic structure which is the basis of a social order For \n Durkheim \n it is a set of shared social norms For Parsons it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation which again are based on a frame of cultural values For Habermas it is all of these as well as communicative action \n Principle of extensiveness \n Another key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a \n society \n the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole \n A good example of this is smaller religions based on the U S such as the \n Amish \n Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community \n Groups and networks \n In every society people belong to groups such as businesses families churches athletic groups or neighborhoods The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society There are \n networks \n and ties between groups as well as inside of each of the groups which create social order \n Some people belong to more than one group and this can sometimes cause conflict The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole and to promote pride within each group Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group enabling social norms and \n values \n to be reinforced \n Status groups \n \" \n Status groups \n \" can be based on a person's characteristics such as \n race \n ethnicity \n sexual orientation \n religion \n caste \n region \n occupation \n physical attractiveness \n gender \n education \n age etc They are defined as \"a subculture having a rather specific rank or status within the stratification system That is societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups some enjoying high ranking and some low \" \n One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a \n garbage man \n A certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups For example around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate \n Hanukkah \n while a Christian family may celebrate \n Christmas \n Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups \n Smaller groups exist inside of one status group For instance one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a \n social class \n based on financial ranking This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class For example a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed \n Values and norms \n Values can be defined as \"internal criteria for evaluation\" Values are also split into two categories there are individual values which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group we associate with friends family or co-workers Norms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation Unlike values norms are enforced externally or outside of oneself A society as a whole determines norms and they can be passed down from generation to generation \n Power and authority \n An exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is \n deviant behavior \n Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time For this reason it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from lack of \n social justice \n It is recognized that effective social justice and the need for authoritative \n social control \n are inversely related \n citation needed \n In societies those who hold positions of power and authority are among the \n upper class \n Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values Tension can form therefore between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that does not conform to the values of both classes \n Spontaneous order \n The order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems These systems being planned by more than one person may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare Considering this \n Thomas Schelling \n studied neighborhood racial segregation His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability but it does not always increase social order In his researching he found that \"when all individuals pursue their own preferences the outcome is segregation rather than integration \" as stated in \"Theories of Social Order\" edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne \n Social honor \n Social honor can also be referred to as social status It is considered the distribution of prestige or \"the approval respect admiration or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances\" The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable they respect or envy people that have more than they do When social honor is referred to as social status it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system Status can be achieved which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control such as race sex or parental social standing An example of \n ascribed status \n is \n Kate Middleton \n who married a prince An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire \n Attainment \n Two different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order The first theory is \"order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes \" as stated in \n Theories of Social Order \n by Hechter and Horne The next theory is that \"the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize \" also stated in \n Theories of Social Order \n by Hechter and Horne Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by \n Pierre Bourdieu \n who developed the idea of social orders ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields \n Sociology portal \n Conservatism portal \n Anti-social behaviour \n Conformity \n Marx's theory of history \n Norm sociology \n Social hierarchy"},

imply a moral quality as indicated by the \n aphorism \n \"cleanliness is next to \n godliness \n \" \n and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as ' \n health \n ' and ' \n beauty \n ' \n In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention the concept of cleanliness differs from \n purity \n which is a physical moral or ritual state of freedom from pollutants Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance cleanliness has a social dimension or implies a system of interactions \n \"Cleanliness \" observed \n Jacob Burckhardt \n \"is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection \" \n A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness but not ordinarily purity cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying \n On a practical level cleanliness is thus related to \n hygiene \n and \n disease \n prevention \n Washing \n is one way of achieving physical cleanliness usually with \n water \n and often some kind of \n soap \n or \n detergent \n Cleaning \n procedures are of the utmost importance in many forms of manufacturing \n As an

Cleanliness is linked with proper hygiene A person who is said to be clean usually depicts cleanliness \n Religion \n In Christianity \n In Hinduism \n In Islam \n Hygiene \n Industry \n Religion \n

sexual relations \n skin disease \n death \n and \n animal sacrifices \n The \n Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church \n prescribes several kinds of \n hand washing \n for example after leaving the

and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives \n Christianity \n has always placed a strong emphasis on \n hygiene \n Despite the denunciation of the \n mixed bathing \n style of Roman pools by \n early Christian \n clergy as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men this did not stop the Church from urging its followers to go to public baths for bathing \n which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the \n Church Father \n Clement of Alexandria \n The Church also built \n public bathing \n facilities that were separate for both sexes near \n monasteries \n and pilgrimage sites also the \n popes \n situated baths within church \n basilicas \n and monasteries since the early Middle Ages \n Pope \n Gregory the Great \n urged his followers on value of \n bathing \n as a bodily need \n In Hinduism \n In \n Hinduism \n cleanliness is an important virtue and the \n Bhagavad Gita \n describes it as one of the divine qualities which one must practice The Sanskrit word for cleanliness is 'aucam' Interestingly the \n Bhagavad Gita \n repeats this word in five slokas at and \n rmad Bhgavatam \n mentioned 'aucam' at as one of the four legs of Satya Yuga or Golden Age as spiritual practice those who are addicted to sex life will not understand cleanliness purity of Atman 8-12 one of the thirty qualities to be acquired cleanliness as a characteristic of a Brahmin cleanliness is a quality of the best worker one should learn cleanliness to serve his or her Guru cleanliness is a natural quality of a Brahmin cleanliness as a virtue among those who has realised God quality to be practiced by a householder means of cleansing one body and mind 36-39 cleanliness means detachment from desire-prompted actions effects of Kali Yuga on cleanliness \n Srimad Bhagavatam \n also recognises cleanliness as one of the thirty qualities which one must acquire to obtain the grace of God \n and identifies internal and external cleanliness among the twelve regular duties \n Cleanliness is also an exalted quality which characterises the Satya Yuga Golden Age in Hinduism As stated by many Hindu scriptures that cleanliness is a way of relative to God \n deva-dvija-guru-prja-pjana aucam rjavam | brahmacaryam ahis ca rra tapa ucyate \n Service of the Devas gods holy men teachers parents and wise persons as also observance of cleanliness uprightness continence and non-injury - these constitute austerities pertaining to the body \n anapekha huchir dakha udsno gata-vyatha| sarvrambha-parityg yo mad-bhakta sa me priya \n Those who are indifferent to worldly gain externally and internally pure skillful without cares untroubled and free from selfishness in all undertakings such devotees of mine are very dear to me \n Cleanliness or aucam is both internal and external Hinduism extols not only external cleanliness but also internal cleanliness or purity Since their minds are constantly absorbed in the all-pure Lord devotees become internally cleansed from the defects of lust anger greed envy ego etc In this state of mind they naturally prefer to keep the external body and environment pure as well Thus in accordance with the old saying Cleanliness is next to Godliness they are also externally pure \n Cleanliness is also a virtue which has to be cultivated by Vedic students and spiritual aspirants \n Srimad Bhagavatam \n also explains the internal and external cleanliness as \n \"My dear Uddhava general cleanliness washing the hands bathing performing religious services at sunrise noon and sunset worshiping Me visiting holy places chanting japa avoiding that which is untouchable uneatable or not to be discussed and remembering My existence within all living entities as the Paramatman these principles should be followed by all members of society through regulation of the mind words and body \" \n All Hindus must make a visit to the seven sacred rivers Bathing in these rivers will purify the mind and increase their good merits Therefore to invoke the presence of the holy rivers the following Mantra is chanted before daily bath \n AUM gage ca yamune caiva godvar sarasvat | narmade sidhu kver jalesmin sanidhim kuru \n In this water I invoke the presence of holy waters from the rivers Ganga Yamuna Godavari Sarasvati Narmada Sindhu and Kaveri \n All \n Hindus \n must have taken a bath before entering temples in order to seek blessings They also wash their feet before entering the temple In some \n Orthodox Hindu \n households taking a bath after visiting a \n funeral \n is required as some \n hindus \n believe that it is an inauspicious thing to witness and the in-auspiciousness would follow This is also related to the pollution of the River Ganges \n Hindus also clean their homes particularly well in preparing to celebrate \n Diwali \n each year as they believe that it brings good \n luck \n Most \n Hindus \n also believe that keeping your house clean and great \n devotion \n are \n gestures \n to welcome the \n Goddess \n Lakshmi \n to their abode to stay Some orthodox Hindus refrain from cleaning their houses on a \n Friday \n as it is a day dedicated to \n Goddess \n Lakshmi \n and cleaning homes on that day is considered inauspicious so they are allowed to clean their homes on the rest of the days \n Tamil people \n also keep their homes clean in preparation for Diwali Pongal or Bhol \n Hinduism also gives a deeper meaning to cleanliness In \n Srimad Bhagavatam \n 36-39 cleanliness is also defined as detachment from activities prompted by desire Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment not merely to frequently rinse one's skin with water \n In Islam \n Muslim hygienical jurisprudence \n There are many verses in the Quran which discuss cleanliness For example Truly Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He 'loves those who keep themselves pure and clean And In mosque there are men who love to be clean and pure Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure \n First lessons in Islamic manuals of \n catechism \n are matters of cleanliness Subjects taught first in the book of cleanliness include which are clean what is clean and what is not clean what people need to be cleansed from how they should clean and which water should they use to clean \n Muslims \n are

Prayer \n Juma \n Ritual baths are recommended for spiritual purity also after committing a sin and are necessary for those who have washed a funeral Special attention is given to cleaning homes before the arrival of guests or before feasts \n Eid al-Fitr \n and \n Eid al-Adha \n and holy days and nights \n Hygiene \n Hygiene \n Since the \n germ theory of disease \n cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other \n hazardous materials \n A reaction to an excessive desire for a germ-free environment began to occur around when \n David Strachan \n put forth the \" \n hygiene hypothesis \n \" in the \n British Medical Journal \n In essence this hypothesis holds that environmental microbes play a useful role in developing the immune system the fewer germs people are exposed to in early childhood the more likely they are to experience health problems in childhood and as adults The \n valuation \n of cleanliness therefore has a social and cultural dimension beyond
