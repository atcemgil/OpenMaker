behaviour of people The term \" \n authority \n \" is often used for power perceived as \n legitimate \n by the \n social structure \n Power can be seen as evil or \n unjust \n but the exercise of power is accepted as \n endemic \n to humans as social beings In \n business \n power is often expressed as being \"upward\" or \"downward\" With downward power a company's superior influences subordinates When a company exerts upward power it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of their leader or leaders \n The use of power need not involve force or the threat of force \n coercion \n At one extreme it closely resembles what an English-speaking person might term \"influence\" although some authors distinguish \"influence\" as a means by which power is used \n One such example is \n soft power \n as compared to \n hard power \n Much of the recent \n sociological \n debate about power revolves around the issue of its means to enable in other words power as a means to make \n social actions \n possible as much as it may constrain or prevent them The philosopher \n Michel Foucault \n saw power as a \n structural \n expression of \"a complex strategic situation in a given \n social setting \n \" \n that requires both constraint and enablement \n Theories \n Five bases \n Legitimate power \n Referent power \n Expert power \n Reward power \n Coercive power \n

literacy \n Quotations \n Theories \n Five bases \n French and Raven's five bases of power \n Social psychologists \n John R P French \n and \n Bertram Raven \n in a now-classic study \n developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work or fail to work in a specific relationship \n According to French and Raven power must be distinguished from influence in the following way power is that state of affairs which holds in a given relationship A-B such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely Conceived this way power is fundamentally \n relative \n it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship and interestingly requires B's recognition of a quality in A which would motivate B to change in the way A intends A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship to effect the desired outcome Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects including a reduction in A's own power \n French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities while not excluding other minor categories Further bases have since been adduced in particular by \n Gareth Morgan \n in his book \n Images of Organization \n Legitimate power \n Legitimate power \n Also called \"positional power \" it is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power such as a \n uniform \n a title or an imposing physical office \n Referent power \n Referent power \n Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build \n loyalty \n It is based on the \n charisma \n and \n interpersonal skills \n of the power holder A person may be admired because of specific personal trait and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence Here the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower \n Nationalism \n and \n patriotism \n count towards an intangible sort of referent power For example soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country This is the second least obvious power but the most effective Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for products endorsements for example The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena \n Abuse is possible when someone that is likable yet lacks integrity and honesty rises to power placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position Referent power is unstable alone and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect When combined with other sources of power however it can help a person achieve great success \n Expert power \n Expert power \n Expert \n power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise Unlike the others this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation suggest solutions use solid judgment and generally out perform others then people tend to listen to them When individuals demonstrate expertise people tend to trust them and respect what they say As subject matter experts their ideas will have more value and others will look to them for \n leadership \n in that area \n Reward power \n Reward power \n Reward \n power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind such as benefits time off desired gifts promotions or increases in pay or responsibility This power is obvious but also ineffective if abused People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or 'moving things too quickly' If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants there's a high probability that they'll do it The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases and managers often can't control promotions all by themselves And even a CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions So when somebody uses up available rewards or the rewards don't have enough perceived value to others their power weakens One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they're to have the same motivational impact Even then if rewards are given frequently people can become satiated by the reward such that it loses its effectiveness \n Coercive power \n Coercive power \n Coercive control \n Coercive \n power is the application of negative influences It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it Threats and \n punishment \n are common tools of coercion Implying or threatening that someone will be fired demoted denied privileges or given undesirable assignments these are examples of using coercive power Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold impoverished style of leadership \n Principles in interpersonal relationships \n According to Guerrero Laura K and Peter A Andersen in \"Close encounters Communication in Relationships\" \n Power as a Perception Power is a perception in a sense that some people can have objective power but still have trouble influencing others People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others Some people become influential even though they don't overtly use powerful behavior \n Power as a Relational Concept Power exists in relationships The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one's partner Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas \n Power as Resource Based Power usually represents a struggle over resources The more scarce and valued resources are the more intense and protracted are power struggles The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand However scarce resource leads to power only if it's valued within a relationship \n The Principle of Least Interest and Dependence Power The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them According to interdependence theory quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship The \n principle of least interest \n suggests that if a difference exists in the intensity of positive feelings between partners the partner who feels the most positive is at a power disadvantage There's an inverse relationship between interest in relationship and the degree of relational power \n Power as \n Enabling \n or Disabling Power can be enabling or disabling Research has been shown that people are more likely to have an enduring influence on others when they engage in dominant behavior that reflects \n social skill \n rather than \n intimidation \n Personal power is protective against pressure and excessive \n influence \n by others and/or situational stress People who communicate through self-confidence and expressive composed behavior tend to be successful in achieving their goals and maintaining good relationships Power can be disabling when it leads to destructive patterns of communication This can lead to the chilling effect where the less powerful person often hesitates to communicate dissatisfaction and the demand withdrawal pattern which is when one person makes demands and the other becomes defensive and withdraws mawasha Both effects have negative consequences for relational satisfaction \n Power as a Prerogative The prerogative principle states that the partner with more power can make and break the rules Powerful people can violate norms break relational rules and manage interactions without as much penalty as powerless people These actions may reinforce the powerful person's dependence power In addition the more powerful person has the prerogative to manage both verbal and nonverbal interactions They can initiate conversations change topics interrupt others initiate touch and end discussions more easily than less powerful people See \n expressions of dominance \n Rational choice framework \n Game theory \n with its foundations in the \n Walrasian \n theory of \n rational choice \n is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships One rational choice definition of power is given by \n Keith Dowding \n in his book \n Power \n In rational choice theory human individuals or groups can be modelled as 'actors' who choose from a 'choice set' of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes An actor's 'incentive structure' comprises its beliefs about the costs associated with different actions in the choice set and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes \n In this setting we can differentiate between \n outcome power \n the ability of an actor to bring about or help bring about outcomes \n social power \n the ability of an actor to change the incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes \n This framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others For example a 'powerful' actor can take options away from another's choice set can change the relative costs of actions can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome or might simply change the other's beliefs about its incentive structure \n As with other models of power this framework is neutral as to the use of 'coercion' For example a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions so can a financial penalty in a 'voluntarily agreed' contract or indeed a friendly offer \n Cultural hegemony \n In the \n Marxist \n tradition the \n Italian \n writer \n Antonio Gramsci \n elaborated the role of \n ideology \n in creating a \n cultural hegemony \n which becomes a means of bolstering the power of \n capitalism \n and of the \n nation-state \n Drawing on \n Niccol Machiavelli \n in \n The Prince \n and trying to understand why there had been no \n Communist \n revolution in \n Western Europe \n while it was claimed there had been one in \n Russia \n Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a \n centaur \n consisting of two halves The back end the beast represented the more classic material image of power power through coercion through brute force be it physical or economic But the capitalist hegemony he argued depended even more strongly on the front end the human face which projected power through 'consent' In Russia this power was lacking allowing for a revolution However in Western Europe specifically in \n Italy \n capitalism had succeeded in exercising \n consensual \n power convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists In this way revolution had been avoided \n While Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a ' \n reserve army of labour \n ' In wartime it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks while after the war the roles are easily reversed Therefore according to Barrett the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women \n Tarnow \n Tarnow \n considers what power hijackers have over air plane passengers and draws similarities with power in the military He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group If the group conforms to the leader's commands the leader's power over an individual is greatly enhanced while if the group does not conform the leader's power over an individual is nil \n Foucault \n For \n Michel Foucault \n real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents with the discovery and emergence of \n Biopower \n and \n Biopolitics \n a biological and political technology of its population highlights this fact No single human group nor single actor runs the dispositif machine or apparatus but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible ensuring its agents do whatever is necessary It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected so remains elusive to 'rational' investigation according to Foucault Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist \n Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon \n entitled \n Recherches et considrations sur la population de la France \n but however turns out to be written by his secretary \n Jean-Baptise Moheau \n and by emphasizing \n Biologist \n Jean-Baptiste Lamarck \n who constantly refers to \n Milieus \n as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water air and light confirming the genus within the milieu in this case the human species relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu This milieu both artificial and natural appears as a target of intervention for power according to Foucault which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty territory and disciplinary space inter woven into from a social and political relations which function as a species biological species \n Clegg \n Stewart Clegg \n proposes another three-dimensional model with his \"circuits of power\" \n theory This model likens the production and organizing of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits episodic dispositional and facilitative These circuits operate at three levels two are macro and one is micro The \n episodic circuit \n is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings communication conflict and resistance in day-to-day interrelations The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative The \n dispositional circuit \n is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority The \n facilitative circuit \n is constituted of macro level technology environmental contingencies job design and networks which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward agency in the episodic circuit All three independent circuits interact at \"obligatory passage points\" which are channels for \n empowerment \n or disempowerment \n Galbraith \n JK Galbraith \n summarizes the types of power as being \"condign\" based on force \"compensatory\" through the use of various resources or \"conditioned\" the result of \n persuasion \n and their sources as \"personality\" individuals \"property\" their material resources and \"organizational\" whoever sits at the top of an organisational power structure \n Gene Sharp \n Gene Sharp \n an American professor of political science believes that power depends ultimately on its bases Thus a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates laws and policies Sharp cites the insight of \n tienne de La Botie \n Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic that is it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power For Sharp political power the power of any state regardless of its particular structural organization ultimately derives from the subjects of the state His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler s If subjects do not obey leaders have no power \n His work is thought to have been influential in the overthrow of \n Slobodan Milosevic \n in the \n Arab Spring \n and other \n nonviolent \n revolutions \n Bjrn Kraus \n Bjrn Kraus \n deals with the \n epistemological \n perspective upon power regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of \n constructivism \n named \n relational constructivism \n Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all \n Coming from \n Max Weber \n 's definition of power \n he realizes that the term of power has to be split into \"instructive power\" and \"destructive power\" \n More precisely instructive power means the chance to determine the actions and thoughts of another person whereas destructive power means the chance to diminish the opportunities of another person \n How significant this distinction really is becomes evident by looking at the possibilities of rejecting power attempts Rejecting instructive power is possible rejecting destructive power is not By using this distinction proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility \n f \n This perspective permits to get over an \"either-or-position\" either there is power or there isn't which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories \n and to introduce the possibility of an \"as well as-position\" \n Unmarked categories \n The idea of \n unmarked categories \n originated in \n feminism \n The theory analyzes the culture of the powerful The powerful comprise those people in society with easy access to resources those who can exercise power without considering their actions For the powerful their culture seems obvious for the powerless on the other hand it remains out of reach lite and expensive \n The \n unmarked category \n can form the identifying mark of the powerful The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else For most Western readers it is posited that if a protagonist's \n race \n is not indicated it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is \n Caucasian \n if a sexual identity is not indicated it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is \n heterosexual \n if the gender of a body is not indicated will be assumed by the reader that it is \n male \n if a disability is not indicated it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is able bodied just as a set of examples \n One can often overlook unmarked categories Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful as they often fall within this category The unmarked category becomes the norm with the other categories relegated to deviant status Social groups can apply this view of power to race \n gender \n and \n disability \n without modification the able body is the neutral body \n Counterpower \n The term 'counter-power' sometimes written 'counterpower' is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as 'a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias' \n Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as 'anti-power' and 'when institutions of counter-power maintain themselves in the face of the state this is usually referred to as a 'dual power' situation' \n Tim Gee \n in his book \n Counterpower Making Change Happen \n put forward a theory that those disempowered by governments' and elite groups' power can use \n counterpower \n to counter this \n In Gee's model \n counterpower \n is split into three categories \n idea counterpower \n economic counterpower \n and \n physical counterpower \n Although the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/ \n anti-globalization movement \n of the 1990s onwards \n the word has been used for at least years for instance \n Martin Buber \n 's book 'Paths in Utopia' includes the line 'Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power' \n Other theories \n Thomas Hobbes \n defined power as a man's \"present means to obtain some future apparent good\" \n Leviathan \n Ch \n The thought of \n Friedrich Nietzsche \n underlies much 20th century analysis of power Nietzsche disseminated ideas on the \" \n will to power \n \" which he saw as the domination of other humans as much as the exercise of control over one's environment \n Some schools of \n psychology \n notably that associated with \n Alfred Adler \n place power dynamics at the core of their theory where orthodox \n Freudians \n might place \n sexuality \n Psychological research \n Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has the less one takes on the perspective of others implying that the powerful have less \n empathy \n Adam Galinsky \n along with several coauthors found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead they are times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power \n Powerful people are also more likely to take action In one example powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people Researchers have documented the \n bystander effect \n they found that powerful people are three times as likely to first offer help to a \"stranger in distress\" \n A study involving over college students suggested that those primed to feel powerful through stating 'power words' were less susceptible to external pressure more willing to give honest feedback and more creative \n Empathy gap \n Empathy gap \n \" \n Power is defined as a possibility to influence others \n \" \n The use of power has evolved from centuries \n citation needed \n Gaining prestige honor and reputation is one of the central motives for gaining power in human nature \n citation needed \n Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the power differences Having power or not having power can cause a number of psychological consequences It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities \n citation needed \n Research experiments were done \n by whom? \n as early as to explore power conflict \n Past research \n Earlier \n when? \n research proposed that increased power relates to increased rewards and leads one to approach things more frequently \n citation needed \n In contrast decreased power relates to more constraint threat and punishment which leads to inhibitions It was concluded \n by whom? \n that being powerful leads one to successful outcomes to develop negotiation strategies and to make more self-serving offers \n citation needed \n Later \n when? \n research proposed that differences in power lead to strategic considerations Being strategic can also mean to defend when one is opposed or to hurt the decision-maker It was concluded \n by whom? \n that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility \n Bargaining games \n Bargaining games were explored \n by whom? \n in and These studies compared behavior done in different power given \n clarification needed \n situations \n In an \n ultimatum game \n the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward \n In a \n dictator game \n the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer \n Conclusion \n The dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game \n Self-serving \n also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed \n When the counterpart recipient is completely powerless lack of strategy social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given the one with the power \n Abusive power and control \n Abusive power and control \n Coercive power \n Abusive power and control or controlling behaviour or coercive control is the way that abusers gain and maintain power and control over a victim for an \n abusive \n purpose such as \n psychological \n physical \n sexual \n or \n financial \n abuse The abuse can be for various reasons such as personal gain personal \n gratification \n psychological projection \n devaluation \n envy \n or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control \n Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive Control may be helped through \n economic abuse \n thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse \n The goal of the abuser is to control and \n intimidate \n the victim or to \n influence \n them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship \n Manipulators \n and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics including \n positive reinforcement \n such as \n praise \n flattery \n ingratiation \n love bombing \n smiling \n gifts \n attention \n negative reinforcement \n intermittent or partial reinforcement \n psychological punishment \n such as \n nagging \n silent treatment \n swearing \n threats \n intimidation \n emotional blackmail \n guilt trips \n inattention and traumatic tactics such as \n verbal abuse \n or \n explosive anger \n The \n vulnerabilities \n of the victim are exploited with those who are particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets \n Traumatic bonding \n can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing \n cycles of abuse \n in which the intermittent reinforcement of \n reward \n and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a \n climate of fear \n An attempt may be made to \n normalise \n legitimise \n rationalise \n deny \n or \n minimise \n the abusive behaviour or \n blame the victim \n for it \n Isolation \n gaslighting \n mind games \n and \n divide and rule \n are other strategies that are often used The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs to help \n disorientate \n them \n Certain personality types feel particularly compelled to control other people \n Tactics \n In everyday situations people use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt people into particular action There are plenty of examples of power tactics that are quite common and employed every day Some of these tactics include \n bullying \n collaboration complaining criticizing demanding disengaging evading humor inspiring \n manipulating \n negotiating socializing and supplicating These power tactics can be classified along three different dimensions \n Soft \n and \n hard \n Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between person and the target They are more indirect and interpersonal e g collaboration socializing Conversely hard tactics are harsh forceful direct and rely on concrete outcomes However they are not more powerful than soft tactics In many circumstances fear of \n social exclusion \n can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment \n Rational and nonrational \n Rational tactics of influence make use of reasoning logic and sound judgment whereas nonrational tactics rely on emotionality and misinformation Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion and evasion and put downs respectively \n Unilateral and bilateral \n Bilateral tactics such as collaboration and negotiation involve reciprocity on the part of both the person influencing and their target Unilateral tactics on the other hand are enacted without any participation on the part of the target These tactics include disengagement and \n fait accompli \n People tend to vary in their use of power tactics with different types of people opting for different tactics For instance interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics \n Machiavellians \n however tend to use nonrational tactics Moreover extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts \n People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation and based on whom they are trying to influence People also tend to shift from soft to hard tactics when they face resistance \n Balance of power \n Because power operates both relationally and reciprocally \n sociologists \n speak of the balance of power between parties to a \n relationship \n all parties to all relationships have \n some \n power the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths equal or unequal stable or subject to periodic change Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of \n constraint \n rather than of power Thus 'power' has a connotation of unilateralism If this were not so then all relationships could be described in terms of 'power' and its meaning would be lost Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others to acquire power you must possess or control a form of power currency \n Effects \n Power changes those in the position of power and those who are targets of that power \n Approach/inhibition theory \n Developed by D Keltner and colleagues \n approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways The reaction of \n approach \n is associated with action self-promotion seeking rewards increased energy and movement \n Inhibition \n on the contrary is associated with self-protection avoiding threats or danger vigilance loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity \n Overall approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies while reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies \n Positive \n Power prompts people to take action \n Makes individuals more responsive to changes within a group and its environment \n Powerful people are more proactive more likely to speak up make the first move and lead negotiation \n Powerful people are more focused on the goals appropriate in a given situation and tend to plan more task-related activities in a work setting \n Powerful people tend to experience more positive emotions such as happiness and satisfaction and they smile more than low-power individuals \n Power is associated with optimism about the future because more powerful individuals focus their attention on more positive aspects of the environment \n People with more power tend to carry out executive cognitive functions more rapidly and successfully including internal control mechanisms that coordinate attention decision-making planning and goal-selection \n Negative \n Powerful people are prone to take risky inappropriate or unethical decisions and often overstep their \n boundaries \n They tend to generate negative emotional reactions in their subordinates particularly when there is a conflict in the group \n When individuals gain power their self-evaluation become more positive while their evaluations of others become more negative \n Power tends to weaken ones social attentiveness which leads to difficulty understanding other peoples point of view \n Powerful people also spend less time collecting and processing information about their subordinates and often perceive them in a stereotypical fashion \n People with power tend to use more coercive tactics increase social distance between themselves and subordinates believe that non-powerful individuals are untrustworthy and devalue work and ability of less powerful individuals \n Reactions \n Tactics \n A number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics e g punishment both personal and impersonal rule-based sanctions and non-personal rewards are less effective than soft tactics expert power referent power and personal rewards \n It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility depression fear and anger while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation \n Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work while instilling a feeling of autonomy in ones subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring \n Coercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group This effect is called \n Disruptive contagion or ripple effect \n and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group and authoritys requests are vague and ambiguous \n Resistance to coercive influence \n Coercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful \n the leader is trusted and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms \n Furthermore coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions \n However in some cases group members chose to resist the authoritys influence When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity they are more likely to form a \n Revolutionary Coalition \n a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the groups authority structure \n Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power uses coercive methods and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments It is because these conditions create \n reactance \n a complex emotional and cognitive reaction that occurs when individuals feel that their freedom to make choices has been threatened or eliminated When reactance occurs individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their authority \n Kelman's compliance-identification-internalization theory of conversion \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three basic step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence \n compliance \n identification \n and \n internalization \n This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time \n At the stage of \n compliance \n group members comply with authoritys demands but personally do not agree with them If authority does not monitor the members they will probably not obey \n Identification \n occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority mimics authoritys actions values characteristics and takes on behaviours of the person with power If prolonged and continuous identification can lead to the final stage internalization \n When \n internalization \n occurs individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system At this stage group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions

opinions or behaviors are affected by others \n Social influence takes many forms and can be seen in \n conformity \n socialization \n peer pressure \n obedience \n leadership \n persuasion \n sales \n and \n marketing \n In Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three broad varieties of social influence \n Compliance \n is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private \n Identification \n is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected such as a famous celebrity \n Internalization \n is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately \n Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard described two psychological \n needs \n that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others These include our need to be right \n informational social influence \n and our need to be liked \n normative social influence \n Informational influence or \n social proof \n is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality Informational influence comes into play when people are uncertain either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement Normative influence is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others In terms of Kelman's typology normative influence leads to public compliance whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance \n Types \n Kelman's varieties \n Compliance \n Identification \n Internalization \n Conformity \n Minority influence \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n Reactance \n Obedience \n Persuasion \n Psychological manipulation \n Antecedents \n Social impact theory \n Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" \n Unanimity \n Status \n Culture \n Emotions \n Social structure \n Social networks \n Types \n Social Influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of \n social psychology \n For more information follow the main article links provided \n Kelman's varieties \n There are three processes of \n attitude change \n as defined by Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n in a paper published in the \n Journal of Conflict Resolution \n The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence for example to separate public conformity behavior from private acceptance personal belief \n Compliance \n Compliance psychology \n Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others Technically compliance is a change in \n behavior \n but not necessarily in \n attitude \n one can comply due to mere \n obedience \n or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures \n According to Kelman's paper the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence i e people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion \n Identification \n Identification psychology \n Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired \n Advertisements \n that rely upon \n celebrity \n endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon According to Kelman the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change \n Internalization \n Internalization \n Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding It is congruent with the individual's value system and according to Kelman the \"reward\" of internalization is \"the content of the new behavior\" \n Conformity \n Conformity \n Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior belief or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence \n Social psychology \n research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties \n informational conformity \n also called \n social proof \n or \"internalization\" in Kelman's terms and \n normative conformity \n \"compliance\" in Kelman's terms \n In the case of \n peer pressure \n a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do such as taking \n illegal drugs \n but which they perceive as \"necessary\" to keep a positive \n relationship \n with other people such as their \n friends \n Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others \n Conformity can be in appearance or may be more complete in nature impacting an individual both publicly and privately \n Compliance also referred to as acquiescence demonstrates a public conformity to a group majority or norm while the individual continues to privately disagree or dissent holding on to their original beliefs or to an alternative set of beliefs differing from the majority Compliance appears as conformity but there is a division between the public and the private self \n Conversion includes the private acceptance that is absent in compliance The individual's original behaviour beliefs or thinking changes to align with that of others the influencers both publicly and privately The individual has accepted the behavior belief or thinking and has internalized it making it his own Conversion may also refer to individual members of a group changing from their initial and varied opinions to adopt the opinions of others which may differ from their original opinions The resulting group position may be a hybrid of various aspects of individual initial opinions or it may be an alternative independent of the initial positions reached through consensus \n What appears to be conformity may in fact be congruence Congruence occurs when an individual's behavior belief or thinking is already aligned with that of the others and no change occurs \n In situations where conformity including compliance conversion and congruence is absent there are non-conformity processes such as independence and anti-conformity Independence also referred to as dissent involves an individual either through their actions or lack of action or through the public expression of their beliefs or thinking being aligned with their personal standards but inconsistent with those of other members of the group either all of the group or a majority Anti-conformity also referred to as counter-conformity may appear as independence but it lacks alignment with personal standards and is for the purpose of challenging the group Actions as well as stated opinions and beliefs are often diametrically opposed to that of the group norm or majority The underlying reasons for this type of behavior may be rebelliousness/obstinacy or it may be to ensure that all alternatives and view points are given due consideration \n Minority influence \n Minority influence \n Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups the level of consistency of the minority group and situational factors such as the affluence or social importance of the minority \n Minority influence most often operates through \n informational social influence \n as opposed to \n normative social influence \n because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between \n belief \n and \n behavior \n A prophecy declared as truth when it is actually false may sufficiently influence people either through fear or logical confusion so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy This term is credited to \n sociologist \n Robert K Merton \n from an article he published in \n Reactance \n Reactance psychology \n Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms This phenomenon has also been called \n anticonformity \n While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended the reactive behavior is a result of \n social pressure \n It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean \n independence \n In many studies reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence even if the influence is clearly correct \n Obedience \n Obedience human behavior \n Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure The \n Milgram experiment \n Zimbardo's \n Stanford prison experiment \n and the \n Hofling hospital experiment \n are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures \n Persuasion \n Persuasion \n Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means \n Robert Cialdini \n defined six \"weapons of influence\" \n reciprocity \n commitment \n social proof \n authority \n liking and \n scarcity \n These \"weapons of influence\" attempt to bring about conformity by directed means Persuasion can occur through \n appeals to reason \n or \n appeals to emotion \n Psychological manipulation \n Psychological manipulation \n Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or \n perception \n of others through \n abusive \n deceptive \n or underhanded tactics \n By advancing the interests of the manipulator often at another's expense such methods could be considered exploitative abusive devious and deceptive \n Social influence is not necessarily negative For example doctors can try to \n persuade \n patients to change unhealthy habits Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it and is not unduly coercive Depending on the context and motivations social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation \n Antecedents \n Many factors can affect the impact of social influence \n Social impact theory \n Social impact theory \n Social impact theory was developed by \n Bibb Latan \n in This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence \n Strength \n The importance of the influencing group to the individual \n Immediacy \n Physical and temporal proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt \n Number \n The number of people in the group \n Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" \n Robert Cialdini \n defines six \"weapons of influence\" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader \n Reciprocity \n People tend to return a favor \n Commitment \n and \n consistency \n People do not like to be self-contradictory Once they commit to an idea or behavior they are averse to changing their minds without good reason \n Social proof \n People will be more open to things that they see others doing For example seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well \n Authority \n People will tend to obey authority figures \n Liking People are more easily swayed by people they like \n Scarcity \n A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand \n Unanimity \n Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence For example in Milgram's first set of \n obedience experiments \n 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer \"maximum shocks\" to a confederate In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks two of whom were confederates once one confederate disobeyed only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks \n Status \n Appeal to authority \n Reputation \n Those perceived as \n experts \n may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise This involves \n credibility \n a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons such as perceived experience attractiveness knowledge etc Additionally pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group This phenomenon is known as \n groupthink \n Appeals to authority may especially affect norms of \n obedience \n The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous \n Milgram experiment \n demonstrate the \n power \n of perceived authority \n Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public For example a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public This is often referred to as using the \" \n bully pulpit \n \" Likewise celebrities don't usually possess any political power but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and therefore possess \n social status \n Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another A person who possesses more authority or is perceived as being more powerful than others in a group is an icon or is most \"popular\" within a group This person has the most influence over others For example in a child's school life people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children \n Culture \n Culture \n appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group \n Stanley Milgram \n found that conformity was higher in \n Norway \n than in \n France \n This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility compared to France's cultural focus on individualism Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity However a \n Asch-style study \n found that when alienated Japanese students were more susceptible to \n anticonformity \n giving answers that were \n incorrect \n even when the group had collaborated on \n correct \n answers one third of the time significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past \n While \n gender \n does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform under certain conditions \n gender roles \n do affect such a likelihood Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men But a study found that \n experimenter bias \n was involved all of the researchers were male while all of the research participants were female Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders Furthermore men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics In other words ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to \n \"social proof\" \n Emotions \n Appeal to emotion \n Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity \n In a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group \n Social structure \n Social networks \n Social network analysis \n A \n social network \n is a \n social structure \n made up of nodes representing individuals or organizations which are connected through \n ties \n also called \n edges \n connections \n or \n links \n by one or more types of interdependency such as friendship common interests or beliefs sexual relations or kinship \n Social network analysis \n uses the lens of \n network theory \n to examine \n social relationships \n Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence For example \n Christakis \n and \n Fowler \n found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity \n smoking \n drinking \n and happiness \n Identifying the extent of social influence based on large-scale observational data with a latent \n social network \n structure is pertinent to a variety of collective social phenomena including \n crime \n civil unrest \n and \n voting behavior \n in elections For example methodologies for disentangling social influence by peers from external influenceswith latent social network structures and large-scale observational datawere applied to US presidential elections \n stock markets \n and \n civil unrest \n Authority bias \n Bystander effect \n Impression management \n Judgeadvisor system \n Mind shaping \n Propaganda"},

{"theme.id": 2, "title": "Need for achievement", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_achievement", "depth": 0, "text": "Need for achievement \n Need for achievement \n N-Ach \n refers to an individual's desire for significant accomplishment mastering of skills control or high standards The term was first used by \n Henry Murray \n and associated with a range of actions These include \"intense prolonged and repeated efforts to accomplish something difficult To work with singleness of purpose towards a high and distant \n goal \n To have the determination to win\" The concept of N-Ach was subsequently popularised by the psychologist \n David McClelland \n This personality trait is characterized by an enduring and consistent concern with setting and meeting high standards of achievement This need is influenced by internal drive for action intrinsic motivation and the pressure exerted by the expectations of others extrinsic motivation Measured with the \n thematic apperception test \n TAT need for achievement motivates an individual to succeed in competition and to excel in activities important to him or her \n Need for Achievement is related to the difficulty of tasks people choose to undertake Those with low N-Ach may choose very easy tasks in order to minimise risk of failure or highly difficult tasks such that a failure would not be embarrassing Those with high N-Ach tend to choose moderately difficult tasks feeling that they are challenging but within reach \n People high in N-Ach are characterised by a tendency to seek challenges and a high degree of independence Their most satisfying reward is the recognition of their achievements Sources of high N-Ach include \n Parents who encouraged independence in \n childhood \n Praise and rewards for success \n Association of achievement with positive feelings \n Association of achievement with one's own competence and effort not luck \n A desire to be effective or challenged \n Intrapersonal Strength \n Desirability \n Feasibility \n Goal Setting Abilities \n In the work place organizations can find it hard to recognize those who are high in the N-Ach and those who are not When people who need and require the necessary attention for their efforts to be recognized by someone who is in an influential position to them if they do not receive the satisfaction or recognition they may become dissatisfied and frustrated with their work or position This can lead to a myriad of problems in job and self-resentment and disapproval \n This can be seen as a negative emotional reaction however in turn as we learned from David McClelland the need for achievement will take its course in different ways A person will either take small easy tasks that they know the can accomplish and be congratulated for or they will accept extremely challenging tasks for they fear not risk of embarrassment in failure due to the high demand of the procured undertaking It has been found that employees motivated by the need for achievement are typically more of the risk takers in the organization They are also the employees that want to constantly be challenged to learn new things \n These people tend to become very absorbed in their work This is why they require recognition when a task is completed \n So If a risk taker becomes dissatisfied due to the lack or appreciation for their work they teeter back and forth on the edge of a knife On either side is an enormous plunge and it can go either way The employee will either continue to work and take more risks and be creative and try harder to impress and gain recognition Or they will go find somewhere else to work In this manner employers managers colleagues and co-workers need to respect everyone who has a need for achievement personality and give them the credit they require to keep them happy This will lead to a productive happy and well established work force Here are some road blocks that those who have a high need for achievement David McClelland suggested other characteristics and attitudes of achievement-motivated people \n Achievement is more important than material or financial reward \n Achieving the aim or task gives greater personal satisfaction than receiving praise or recognition \n Financial reward is regarded as a measurement of success not an end in itself \n Security is not prime motivator nor is status \n Feedback is essential because it enables measurement of success not for reasons of praise or recognition the implication here is that feedback must be reliable quantifiable and factual \n Achievement-motivated people constantly seek improvements and ways of doing things better \n Theory \n Measurement \n Further reading \n Theory \n The pioneering research work of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the 1930s summarized in \n Explorations in Personality \n provided the start point for future studies of personality especially those relating to needs and motives \n David C McClelland's \n and his associates' investigations of achievement motivation have particular relevance to the emergence of leadership McClelland was interested in the possibility of deliberately arousing a motive to achieve in an attempt to explain how individuals express their preferences for particular outcomesa general problem of motivation In this connection the need for achievement refers to an individual's preference for success under conditions of competition The vehicle \n McClelland \n employed to establish the presence of an achievement motive was the type of fantasy a person expressed on the \n Thematic Apperception Test \n TAT developed by Christiana Morgan and Henry Murray who note in \n Explorations in Personality \n that \" when a person interprets an ambiguous social situation he is apt to expose his own personality as much as the phenomenon to which he is attending Each picture should suggest some critical situation and be effective in evoking a fantasy relating to it\" p531 The test is composed of a series of pictures that subjects are asked to interpret and describe to the psychologist The TAT has been widely used to support assessment of needs and motives \n In McClelland published The Achieving Society which articulated his model of human motivation McClelland contended that three dominant needs -for achievement for power and for affiliation- underpin human motivation McClelland believed that the relative importance of each need varies among individuals and cultures Arguing that commonly used hiring tests using IQ and personality assessments were poor predictors of competency McClelland proposed that companies should base hiring decisions on demonstrated competency in relevant fields rather than on standardized test scores Iconoclastic in their time McClellands ideas have become standard practice in many corporations \n The procedure in McClelland's initial investigation was to arouse in the test audience a concern with their achievement A control group was used in which arousal was omitted In the course of this experiment McClelland discovered through analyzing the stories on the TAT that initial arousal was not necessary Instead members of the control group individuals who had had no prior arousal demonstrated significant differences in their stories some writing stories with a high achievement content and some submitting stories with a low achievement content Using results based on the \n Thematic Apperception Test \n McClelland demonstrated that individuals in a society can be grouped into high achievers and low achievers based on their scores on what he called \"N-Ach\" \n McClelland \n and his associates have since extended their work in fantasy analysis to include different age groups occupational groups and nationalities in their investigations of the strength of need for achievement These investigations have indicated that the N-Ach score increases with a rise in occupational level Invariably businessmen managers and entrepreneurs are high scorers Other investigations into the characteristics of the high achievers have revealed that accomplishment on the job represents an end in itself monetary rewards serve as an index of this accomplishment In addition these other studies found that the high achievers though identified as managers businessmen and entrepreneurs are not gamblers A high emotional intelligence calls for a high need for achievement while a low emotional intelligence calls for a lower need for achievement They will accept risk only to the degree they believe their personal contributions will make a difference in the final outcome \n An experiment realized to entry level managers of AT&T from to studied the level of achievement attained during a period of to years showing that High n-Achievement was associated with managerial success at lower levels of management jobs in which promotion depends more on individual contributions than it does at higher levels At the higher levels in which promotion depends on demonstrated ability to manage others a high n-Achievement is not associated with success by contrast the leadership motive pattern is so associated in all likelihood because it involves a high n-Power emerging as a concern for influencing people \n These explorations into the achievement motive seem to turn naturally into the investigation of national differences based on Max Weber's thesis that the industrialization and economic development of the Western nations were related to the Protestant ethic and its corresponding values supporting work and achievement McClelland and his associates have satisfied themselves that such a relationship viewed historically through an index of national power consumption indeed exists Differences related to individual as well as to national accomplishments depend on the presence or absence of an achievement motive in addition to economic resources or the infusion of financial assistance High achievers can be viewed as satisfying a need for self-actualization through accomplishments in their job assignments as a result of their particular knowledge their particular experiences and the particular environments in which they have lived \n Measurement \n The techniques McClelland and his collaborators developed to measure N-Ach \n N-Affil \n and \n N-Pow \n see McClelland et al can be viewed as a radical break with the dominant \n psychometric \n tradition However it should be recognized that McClelland's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of \n Henry Murray \n both in terms of Murray's model of human needs and motivational processes and his work with the OSS during World War Two It was during this period that Murray introduced the idea of \"situation tests\" and multi-rater / multi-method assessments It was Murray who first identified the significance of Need for Achievement Power and Affiliation and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model \n Whilst trait-based personality theory assume that high-level competencies like initiative creativity and leadership can be assessed using \"internally consistent\" measures see \n psychometrics \n the McClelland measures recognize that such competencies are difficult and demanding activities which will neither be developed nor displayed unless people are undertaking activities they care about i e are strongly motivated to undertake Furthermore it is the cumulative number of independent but cumulative and substitutable components of competence they bring to bear while seeking to carry out these activities that will determine their success Accordingly the N-Ach N-Aff and N-Pow scoring systems simply count how many components of competence people bring to bear whilst carrying out activities they have a strong personal inclination or motivation to undertake \n McClellands research led him to formulate psychological characteristics of persons with strong need for achievement According to McClelland and David Winter \n Motivating Economic Achievement \n the following features accompany high level of achievement motivation \n Moderate risk propensity \n Undertaking innovative and engaging tasks \n Internal locus of control and responsibility for own decisions and behaviors \n Need for precise goal setting \n An important corollary is that there is no point in trying to assess people's abilities without first finding out what they care about So one cannot as some psychometricians try to do assess such

humanity \n and \n Bah' Faith and the unity of religion \n In Bah' belief a single God has sent all the historic founders of the world religions in a process of \n progressive revelation \n As a result the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose In this view there is unity among the founders of world religions but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic \n Within this universal view the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bah' Faith \n The \n Bah' teachings \n state that since all humans have been created in the image of God God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race colour or religion \n Thus because all humans have been created equal they all require equal opportunities and treatment \n Thus the Bah' view promotes the unity of humanity and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation \n The teaching however does not equal unity with uniformity but instead the Bah' writings advocate for the principle of \n unity in diversity \n where the variety in the human race is valued \n Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards and the inevitability of \n world peace \n Christianity \n Christian Universalism \n The fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is \n universal reconciliation \n that all humans will eventually be saved and eventually enter Heaven in God's kingdom through the grace and work of \n Jesus Christ \n Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal \n Hell \n does not exist and was not what Jesus taught They point to historical evidence which shows that some of the early \n church fathers \n were universalists and attribute the beginning of the idea of hell as eternal to mistranslation \n and as a later creation of the \n Catholic Church \n Universalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings \n They also argue that an eternal hell is both unjust and against the nature and attributes of a loving God \n The remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are compatible with Christianity in general \n citation needed \n God \n is the loving Parent of all people see \n Love of God \n Jesus Christ \n reveals the nature and character of God and is the spiritual leader of humankind see \n New Covenant \n Humankind is created with an

Universalist General Convention later called the \n Universalist Church of America \n adopted the Five Principles the belief in God Jesus Christ the immortality of the human soul the reality of sin and \n universal reconciliation \n History of Universal Reconciliation \n Universalist writers such as \n George T Knight \n have claimed that Universalism was a widely held view among theologians in \n Early Christianity \n including important figures such as \n Origen \n and \n Clement of Alexandria \n Origen and Clement both taught the existence of a non-eternal Hell Hell was remedial in that it was a place one went to purge one's sins before entering Heaven \n The first undisputed documented appearance of Christian Universalist ideas was in 17th-century England and 18th-century Europe and

variously \" \n Similarly in the \n Bhagavad Gt \n God manifesting as an incarnation states \"As people approach me so I receive them All paths lead to me \" \n The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God whether one knows it or not \n While Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions it also has a wide range of diversity within it \n There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology \n as well as multiple unorthodox or

neo-Hinduism \n is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and \n orientalism \n It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect \n It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a \"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\" \n with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine \n For example it presents that \n an imagined \"integral unity\" that was probably little more than an \"imagined\" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality \"on the ground \" as it were throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region \n Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity \n self-published source \n This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture \n extending far beyond the \n Dashanami Sampradaya \n the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by \n Adi Shankara \n An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was \n Ram Mohan Roy \n who established the \n Brahmo Samaj \n Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by \n Vivekananda \n and \n Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan \n Veneration for all other religions was articulated by \n Gandhi \n After long study and experience I have come to the conclusion that all religions are true all religions have some error in them all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith therefore no thought of conversion is possible \n Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation regarding Vedanta to be the \"central theology of Hinduism\" \n Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a \"single world religion\" \n and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta \n citation not found \n Islam \n Further information \n Ummah \n Divisions of the world in Islam \n People of the Book \n Dhimmi \n and \n Dawah \n Islam recognizes to a

Book\" \n ahl al-kitab \n Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include \n Zoroastrians \n and later even Hindus as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews Christians and \n Sabians \n as People of the Book \n need quotation to verify \n not in citation given \n not in citation given \n The relation between Islam and universalism has assumed crucial importance in the context of \n political Islam \n or \n Islamism \n particularly in reference to \n Sayyid Qutb \n a leading member of the \n Muslim Brotherhood \n movement and one of the key contemporary philosophers of Islam \n There are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism According to the most inclusive teachings common among the \n liberal Muslim movements \n all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation For example Surah states that \n unreliable source? \n pageneeded \n Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians and Sabians whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve let there be no compulsion in religion \n However the most exclusive teachings opinion differently For example the \n Salafi \n refer to Surah \n citation needed \n Then when the sacred months have passed slay the idolaters \n mushrikun \n wherever ye find them and take them and besiege them and lay in wait in every stratagem of war But if they repent and establish worship and pay the \n Zakat \n then leave their way free Lo! Allah is Forgiving Merciful Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture i e people of the book as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger and follow not the Religion of Truth until they pay the \n jizya \n readily being brought low in submission \n The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought traditionalist and reform-minded and branches of Islam from the reforming \n Quranism \n and \n Ahmadiyya \n to the ultra-traditionalist \n Salafi \n as is the doctrine of abrogation \n naskh \n which is used to determine which verses take precedence based on reconstructed chronology with later verses superseding earlier ones The traditional chronology places Surah as the last or second-to-last surah revealed thus in traditional exegesis it gains a large power of abrogation and verses are held to have abrogated \n The ahadith also play a major role in this and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections generally along with the \n Muwatta Imam Malik \n Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith to the Salafi or \n ahl al-hadith \n who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence \n Traditional Islam \n views the world as bipartite consisting of the House of Islam that is where people live under the \n Islamic law \n and the House of War that is where the people do not live under Islamic law which must be proselytized \n using whatever resources available including in some traditionalist and conservative interpretations \n the use of violence as holy struggle in the path of Allah \n to either convert its inhabitants to Islam or to rule them under the Shariah cf \n dhimmi \n Judaism \n Jewish views on religious pluralism \n Noahidism \n Judaism teaches that God \n chose the Jewish people \n to be in a unique covenant with God and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the \n Torah \n with a specific missionto be a light unto the nations and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoplesrather Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as \n Noachides \n and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind \n An on-line organization the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by \n Steven Blane \n who calls himself an \"American Jewish Universalist Rabbi\" believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism stating that \"God equally chose all nations to be

describe the freedoms for which allied nations fought in World War II \n Main articles \n Political freedom \n and \n Liberty \n In political discourse \n political freedom \n is often associated with \n liberty \n and \n autonomy \n in the sense of \"giving oneself one's own laws\" and with having \n rights \n and the \n civil liberties \n with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include \n freedom of assembly \n freedom of association \n freedom of choice \n and \n freedom of speech \n In some circumstances particularly when discussion is limited to political freedoms the terms \"freedom\" and \"liberty\" tend to be used interchangeably \n Elsewhere however subtle distinctions between freedom and liberty have been noted \n JohnStuartMill \n differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily if not exclusively the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved As such the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others \n Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains the differences in terms of their relation to institutions \n Liberty is linked to human subjectivity freedom is not The Declaration of Independence for example describes men as

attributes freedom \n degrees of freedom \n free bodies \n to objects \n Freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline Liberty like discipline is linked to institutions and political parties whether liberal or libertarian freedom is not Although freedom can work for or against institutions it is not bound to themit travels through unofficial networks To have liberty is to be

Patterson has argued in \n Freedom Freedom in the Making of Western Culture \n that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves \n Another distinction that some political theorists have deemed important is that people may aspire to have freedom \n from \n limiting forces such as \n freedom from fear \n freedom from want \n and \n freedom from discrimination \n but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty \n from \n anything \n To the contrary the concept of \n negative liberty \n refers to the liberty one person may have to restrict the rights of others \n Other important fields in which freedom is an issue include \n economic freedom \n academic freedom \n intellectual freedom \n and \n scientific freedom \n Freedom as a physical concept \n In purely physical terms freedom is used much more broadly to describe the limits to which physical movement or other physical processes are possible This relates to the philosophical concept to the extent that people may be considered to have as much freedom as they are physically able to exercise The number of independent \n variables \n or parameters for a system is described as its number of \n degrees of freedom \n For example the movement of a vehicle along a road has two degrees of freedom to go fast or slow or to change direction by turning left or right The movement of a ship sailing on the waves has four degrees of freedom since it can also pitch nose-to-tail and roll side-to-side An aeroplane can also climb and sideslip giving it \n six degrees of freedom \n Degrees of freedom in mechanics \n describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or in case of a \n mechanism \n made of several bodies the number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism In the study of complex \n motor control \n there may be so many degrees of freedom that a given action can be achieved in different ways by combining movements

instead of \n dimension \n this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined Such degrees of freedom appear in many mathematical and related disciplines

around the time of the 12th dynasty and the text was used in the \n eighteenth \n and \n nineteenth \n dynasties \n Let thy desire flourish \n In order to let thy heart forget the \n beatifications \n for thee \n Follow thy desire as long as thou shalt live \n Put \n myrrh \n upon thy head and clothing of fine linen upon thee \n Being anointed with genuine marvels of the gods' property \n Set an increase to thy good things \n Let not thy heart flag \n Follow thy desire and thy good \n Fulfill thy needs upon earth after the command of thy heart \n Until there come for thee that day of mourning \n Classic schools of antiquity \n Democritus \n seems to be the earliest philosopher on record to have categorically embraced a hedonistic philosophy he called the supreme goal of life \"contentment\" or \"cheerfulness\" claiming that \"joy and sorrow are the distinguishing mark of things beneficial and harmful\" \n DK \n B \n Cyrenaic school \n Cyrenaics \n Aristippus of Cyrene \n The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BC supposedly by \n Aristippus of Cyrene \n although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name \n Aristippus the Younger \n The school was so called after \n Cyrene \n the birthplace of Aristippus It was one of the earliest \n Socratic \n schools The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure which meant not just the absence of pain but positively enjoyable sensations Of these momentary pleasures especially physical ones are stronger than those of anticipation or memory They did however recognize the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from \n altruism \n citation needed \n Theodorus the Atheist \n was a latter exponent of hedonism who was a disciple of \n younger Aristippus \n while becoming well known for expounding \n atheism \n The school died out within a century and was replaced by \n Epicureanism \n The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical \n theory of knowledge \n They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth \n They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate \n sense-experiences \n for instance that I am having a sweet sensation now but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations for instance that the honey is sweet \n They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like \n All knowledge is immediate sensation These sensations are motions which are purely subjective and are painful indifferent or pleasant according as they are violent tranquil or gentle \n Further they are entirely individual and can in no way be described as constituting absolute objective knowledge Feeling therefore is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct \n Our ways of being affected are alone knowable Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure \n Cyrenaicism deduces a single universal aim for all people which is pleasure Furthermore all feeling is momentary and homogeneous It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind \n Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures being more simple and more intense were preferable \n Momentary pleasure preferably of a physical kind is the only good for humans However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them otherwise pain will result and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life \n Regard should be paid to law and custom because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others \n Likewise friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide \n Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behaviour \n Epicureanism \n Main articles \n Epicureanism \n and \n Epicurus \n Epicureanism is a system of \n philosophy \n based upon the teachings of \n Epicurus \n c \n c \n BC founded around BC Epicurus was an \n atomic \n materialist \n following in the steps of \n Democritus \n and \n Leucippus \n His \n materialism \n led him to a general stance against superstition or the idea of divine intervention Following \n Aristippus \n about whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest sustainable \"pleasure\" in the form of a state of tranquility and freedom from fear \n ataraxia \n and absence of bodily pain \n aponia \n through knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of our desires The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure as the sole intrinsic good its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from \"hedonism\" as it is commonly understood \n Epicurus \n In the Epicurean view the highest pleasure tranquility and freedom from fear was obtained by knowledge friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires such as sex and appetites verging on \n asceticism \n He argued that when eating one should not eat too richly for it could lead to dissatisfaction later such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future Likewise sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived but had a unique version of the \n Golden Rule \n It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly agreeing \"neither to harm nor be harmed\" \n and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life \n Epicureanism was originally a challenge to \n Platonism \n though later it became the main opponent of \n Stoicism \n Epicurus and his followers shunned politics After the death of Epicurus his school was headed by \n Hermarchus \n later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era such as those in \n Antiochia \n Alexandria \n Rhodes \n and \n Ercolano \n The poet \n Lucretius \n is its most known Roman proponent By the end of the Roman Empire having undergone Christian attack and repression Epicureanism had all but died out and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist \n Pierre Gassendi \n who adapted it to the Christian doctrine \n Some writings by Epicurus have survived Some scholars consider the epic poem \n On the Nature of Things \n by \n Lucretius \n to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the \n Villa of the Papyri \n at \n Herculaneum \n are Epicurean texts At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean \n Philodemus \n Yangism \n Yangism \n Yangism has been described as a form of psychological and ethical egoism The Yangist philosophers believed in the importance of maintaining self-interest through \"keeping one's nature intact protecting one's uniqueness and not letting the body be tied by other things \" Disagreeing with the Confucian virtues of li propriety ren humaneness and yi righteousness and the Legalist virtue of fa law the Yangists saw wei wo or \"everything for myself \" as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation Individual pleasure is considered desirable like in hedonism but not at the expense of the health of the individual The Yangists saw individual well-being as the prime purpose of life and considered anything that hindered that well-being immoral and unnecessary \n The main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of xing or human nature a term later incorporated by Mencius into Confucianism The xing according to sinologist A C Graham is a person's \"proper course of development\" in life Individuals can only rationally care for their own xing and should not naively have to support the xing of other people even if it means opposing the emperor In this sense Yangism is a \"direct attack\" on Confucianism by implying that the power of the emperor defended in Confucianism is baseless and destructive and that state intervention is morally flawed \n The Confucian philosopher Mencius depicts Yangism as the direct opposite of Mohism while Mohism promotes the idea of universal love and impartial caring the Yangists acted only \"for themselves \" rejecting the altruism of Mohism He criticized the Yangists as selfish ignoring the duty of serving the public and caring only for personal concerns Mencius saw Confucianism as the \"Middle Way\" between Mohism and Yangism \n Judaism \n Judaism \n believes that mankind was created for pleasure as \n God \n placed \n Adam and Eve \n in the \n Garden of Eden \n Eden being the Hebrew word for \"pleasure \" In recent years Rabbi \n Noah Weinberg \n articulated five different \n levels of pleasure \n connecting with God is the highest possible pleasure \n Christian hedonism \n Christian hedonism \n Christian doctrine \n current in some \n evangelical \n circles particularly those of the \n Reformed \n tradition \n The term was first coined by \n Reformed Baptist \n theologian \n John Piper \n in his book \n Desiring God \n My shortest summary of it is God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him Or The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever Does Christian Hedonism make a god out of pleasure? No It says that we all make a god out of what we take most pleasure in \n Piper states his term may describe the theology of \n Jonathan Edwards \n who referred to a future enjoyment of him God in heaven \n In the 17th century the atomist \n Pierre Gassendi \n adapted Epicureanism to the Christian doctrine \n Hinduism \n The concept of hedonism is also found in the \n Hindu scriptures \n Utilitarianism \n Utilitarianism \n Utilitarianism addresses problems with moral motivation neglected by \n Kantianism \n by giving a central role to happiness It is an ethical theory holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes the overall good of the society \n It is thus one form of \n consequentialism \n meaning that the moral worth of an \n action \n is determined by its resulting outcome The most influential contributors to this theory are considered to be the 18th and 19th-century British philosophers \n Jeremy Bentham \n and \n John Stuart Mill \n Conjoining hedonismas a view as to what is good for peopleto utilitarianism has the result that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest total amount of happiness see \n Hedonic calculus \n Though consistent in their pursuit of happiness Bentham and Mill's versions of hedonism differ There are two somewhat basic schools of thought on hedonism \n One school grouped around Bentham defends a quantitative approach Bentham believed that the value of a pleasure could be quantitatively understood Essentially he believed the value of pleasure to be its intensity multiplied by its duration - so it was not just the number of pleasures but their intensity and how long they lasted that must be taken into account \n Other proponents like Mill argue a qualitative approach Mill believed that there can be different levels of pleasure - higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure Mill also argues that simpler beings he often refers to pigs have an easier access to the simpler pleasures since they do not see other aspects of life they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures The more elaborate beings tend to spend more thought on other matters and hence lessen the time for simple pleasure It is therefore more difficult for them to indulge in such \"simple pleasures\" in the same manner \n Contemporary approaches \n Contemporary proponents of hedonism include \n Swedish \n philosopher \n Torbjrn Tnnsj \n Fred Feldman \n and Spanish ethic philosopher \n Esperanza Guisn \n published a \"Hedonist manifesto\" in \n Michel Onfray \n Michel Onfray \n Michel Onfray contemporary hedonist philosopher \n A dedicated contemporary hedonist philosopher and writer on the history of hedonistic thought is the French \n Michel Onfray \n He has written two books directly on the subject \n L'invention du plaisir fragments cyraniques \n and \n La puissance d'exister Manifeste hdoniste \n He defines hedonism \"as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others without harming yourself or anyone else \" \n Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism a joyous \n utilitarianism \n and a generalized \n aesthetic \n of sensual \n materialism \n that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent -- while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art politics and everyday life and decisions \" \n Onfray's works \"have explored the philosophical resonances and components of and challenges to science painting gastronomy sex and sensuality bioethics wine and writing His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume Counter-history of Philosophy \" \n of which three have been published For him \"In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other Obtaining this balance my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others presumes that we approach the subject from different angles political ethical aesthetic erotic bioethical pedagogical historiographical \" \n For this he has \"written books on each of these facets of the same world view \" \n His philosophy aims for \"micro-revolutions\" or \"revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic libertarian values \" \n Abolitionism \n David Pearce philosopher \n David Pearce transhumanist philosopher \n The \n Abolitionist Society \n is a \n transhumanist \n group calling for the abolition of \n suffering \n in all sentient life through the use of advanced \n biotechnology \n Their core philosophy is \n negative utilitarianism \n David Pearce \n is a theorist of this perspective and he believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of \n suffering \n in all \n sentient \n life His book-length internet manifesto \n The Hedonistic Imperative \n outlines how \n technologies \n such as \n genetic engineering \n nanotechnology \n pharmacology \n and \n neurosurgery \n could potentially \n converge \n to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals replacing suffering with gradients of well-being a project he refers to as \" \n paradise engineering \n \" \n A \n transhumanist \n and a \n vegan \n Pearce believes that we or our future posthuman descendants have a responsibility not only to avoid \n cruelty to animals \n within human society but also to alleviate the suffering of animals in the wild \n In a talk David Pearce gave at the \n Future of Humanity Institute \n and at the \n Charity International \n 'Happiness Conference' he said \"Sadly what \n won't \n abolish suffering or at least not on its own is socio-economic reform or exponential economic growth or technological progress in the usual sense or any of the traditional panaceas for solving the world's ills Improving the external environment is admirable and important but such improvement can't recalibrate our hedonic treadmill above a genetically constrained ceiling Twin studies confirm there is a partially heritable set-point of well-being - or ill-being - around which we all tend to fluctuate over the course of a lifetime This set-point varies between individuals It's possible to \n lower \n an individual's hedonic set-point by inflicting prolonged uncontrolled stress but even this re-set is not as easy as it sounds suicide-rates typically go down in wartime and six months after a quadriplegia-inducing accident studies \n citation needed \n suggest that we are typically neither more nor less unhappy than we were before the catastrophic event Unfortunately attempts to build an ideal society can't overcome this biological ceiling whether utopias of the left or right free-market or socialist religious or secular futuristic high-tech or simply cultivating one's garden Even if \n everything \n that traditional futurists have asked for is delivered -

neurophysiological parameter unambiguously corresponding to the feeling of pleasure hedonic tone \n According to Argonov posthumans will be able to reprogram their motivations in an arbitrary manner to get pleasure from any programmed activity \n And if pleasure principle postulates are true then general direction of civilization development is obvious maximization of integral happiness in posthuman life product of life span and average happiness Posthumans will avoid constant pleasure stimulation because it is incompatible with rational behavior required to prolong life However in average they can become much happier than modern humans \n Many other aspects of posthuman society could be predicted by hedodynamics if the neural correlate of pleasure were discovered For example optimal number of individuals their optimal body size whether it matters for happiness or not and the degree of aggression \n Criticisms \n Critics of hedonism have objected to its exclusive concentration on pleasure as valuable \n In particular \n G E Moore \n offered a thought experiment in criticism of pleasure as the sole bearer of value he imagined two worldsone of exceeding beauty and the other a heap of filth Neither of these worlds will be experienced by anyone The question then is if it is better for the beautiful world to exist than the heap of filth In this Moore implied that states of affairs have value beyond conscious pleasure which he said spoke against the validity of hedonism \n Affectionism \n Eudaimonia \n Hedonism Resorts \n Libertine \n Paradox of hedonism \n Pleasure principle psychology \n Psychological hedonism"},

lexeme \n in the English word \n creativity \n comes from the \n Latin \n term \n cre \n \"to create make\" its \n derivational suffixes \n also come from Latin The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century notably in Chaucer to indicate divine creation \n in \n The Parson's Tale \n However its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after \n the Enlightenment \n History of the concept \n History of the concept of creativity \n Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity preferring to see art as a form of discovery Asked in \n The Republic \n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" Plato answers \"Certainly not he merely \n imitates \n \" \n Ancient views \n Most ancient cultures including thinkers of \n Ancient Greece \n Ancient China \n and \n Ancient India \n lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation The \n ancient Greeks \n had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \" \n poiein \n \" \"to make\" which only applied to \n poiesis \n poetry and to the \n poietes \n poet or \"maker\" who made it \n Plato \n did not believe in art as a form of creation Asked in \n The Republic \n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" he answers \"Certainly not he merely \n imitates \n \" \n It is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in \n Western culture \n through \n Christianity \n as a matter of \n divine inspiration \n According to the historian \n Daniel J Boorstin \n \"the early Western conception of creativity was the \n Biblical story of creation \n given in the \n Genesis \n \" \n However this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the \n Renaissance \n In the Judaeo-Christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work \n A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance \n Muses \n were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods \n Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \" \n daemon \n \" Greek or \" \n genius \n \" Latin linked to the sacred or the divine However none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the \n Renaissance \n It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of \" \n great men \n \" \n The Enlightenment and after \n The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the \n Renaissance \n and even later \n The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the \n Renaissance \n when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named \n humanism \n which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual \n From this philosophy arose the \n Renaissance man \n or polymath an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation \n One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is \n Leonardo da Vinci \n However this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment \n By the 18th century and the \n Age of Enlightenment \n mention of creativity notably in \n aesthetics \n linked with the concept of \n imagination \n became more frequent \n In the writing of \n Thomas Hobbes \n imagination became a key element of human cognition \n William Duff \n was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of \n genius \n typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius \n As a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century \n Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of \n Darwinism \n In particular they refer to the work of \n Francis Galton \n who through his \n eugenicist \n outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius \n In the late 19th and early 20th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as \n Hermann von Helmholtz \n and \n Henri Poincar \n began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes \n Twentieth century to the present day \n The insights of Poincar and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as \n Graham Wallas \n and \n Max Wertheimer \n In his work \n Art of Thought \n published in Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process In the Wallas stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of stages \n i \n preparation \n preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions \n ii \n incubation \n where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening \n iii \n intimation \n the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way \n iv \n illumination \n or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its \n preconscious \n processing into conscious awareness \n v \n verification \n where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied \n Wallas' model is often treated as four stages with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage \n Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the \n evolutionary \n process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments Simonton \n provides an updated perspective on this view in his book \n Origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity \n In \n Alfred North Whitehead \n gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as \n Process and Reality \n He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme \"Whitehead actually coined the term our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that its invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded\" \n The formal \n psychometric \n measurement of creativity from the standpoint of orthodox \n psychological \n literature is usually considered to have begun with \n J P Guilford \n 's address to the \n American Psychological Association \n which helped popularize the topic \n and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as with the work of H L Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination \n but it did not have the same impact Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to \n IQ \n -type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down \n \"Four C\" model \n James C Kaufman \n and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity \n mini-c \n \"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights\" \n little-c \n everyday problem solving and creative expression \n Pro-C \n exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and \n Big-C \n creativity considered great in the given field This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity It also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals \n The contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used Kozbelt Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity \n Margaret Boden \n distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal \n Robinson \n and Anna Craft \n have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity \n and cites \n Ken Robinson \n as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity \n Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi \n has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain-changing contributions Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity \n Theories of creative processes \n There has been much empirical study in \n psychology \n and \n cognitive science \n of the processes through which creativity occurs Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity \n Incubation \n Incubation is a temporary break from \n creative problem solving \n that can result in insight \n There has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas' model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving Ward \n lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some \n empirical evidence \n is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become \n fixated \n on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem \n This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks \n This earlier hypothesis is discussed in \n Csikszentmihalyi \n 's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem \n Convergent and divergent thinking \n J P Guilford \n drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed \n convergent \n and \n divergent thinking \n Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature Other researchers have occasionally used the terms \n flexible \n thinking or \n fluid intelligence \n which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity \n citation needed \n Creative cognition approach \n In Finke et al proposed the \"Geneplore\" model in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts \n Weisberg \n argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results \n The ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory \n Helie and Sun \n recently proposed a unified framework for understanding \n creativity in problem solving \n namely the ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory of creativity This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of \n incubation \n and \n insight \n The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely \n The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge \n The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks \n The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge \n The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing \n The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing \n A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the \n CLARION cognitive architecture \n and used to simulate relevant human data This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena \n Conceptual blending \n Conceptual blending \n In \n The Act of Creation \n Arthur Koestler \n introduced the concept of \n bisociation \n that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference \n This idea was later developed into conceptual blending In the 1990s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with \n metaphor \n analogy \n and \n structure mapping \n have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label \n conceptual blending \n Honing theory \n Honing theory developed principally by psychologist \n Liane Gabora \n posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self-mending nature of a worldview The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process When faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the worldview changes through interaction with the task This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only is the task conceived of differently but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge \n A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state \n Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task Thus the creative idea may feel half-baked It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with \n Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization However research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing \n Everyday imaginative thought \n In everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only \" \n Their \n counterfactual thinking \n is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes \n It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought \n Assessing individual creative ability \n Creativity quotient \n Several attempts have been made to develop a \n creativity quotient \n of an individual similar to the \n intelligence quotient \n IQ however these have been unsuccessful \n Psychometric approach \n J P Guilford \n 's group \n which pioneered the modern \n psychometric \n study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in \n Plot Titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles \n Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness \n Figure Concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommonness \n Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks \n Remote Associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e g Hand Call \n Remote Consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e g loss of gravity \n Building on Guilford's work \n Torrance \n developed the \n Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \n in \n They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on \n Fluency \n The total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus \n Originality \n The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects \n Elaboration \n The amount of detail in the responses \n The \n Creativity Achievement Questionnaire \n a self-report test that measures creative achievement across domains was described in and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output \n Such tests sometimes called \n Divergent Thinking DT \n tests have been both supported \n and criticized \n Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of \n divergent thinking \n tests using semantic approach When compared to human raters \n NLP \n techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality when compared to human raters \n The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of and respectively to human graders \n Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures \n Most recently an NSF-funded \n team of researchers led by \n James C Kaufman \n and Mark A Runco \n combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system This system enabled automated scoring of \n DT \n tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of \n DT \n tests that had been found and reported \n The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of to human graders \n Social-personality approach \n Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity In these studies personality traits such as independence of judgement self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals \n A \n meta-analysis \n by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self-accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive \" Openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed \n Within the framework of the \n Big Five \n model of personality some consistent traits have emerged \n Openness to experience \n has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity \n Among the other Big Five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity Compared to non-artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience \n conscientious \n and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists \n Creativity and intelligence \n The potential relationship between creativity and \n intelligence \n has been of interest since the late 1900s when a multitude of influential studies from Getzels & Jackson \n Barron \n Wallach & Kogan \n and Guilford \n focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why \n There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the main theories as follows \n Threshold Theory Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120 \n Certification Theory Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence Instead individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence \n Interference Theory Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability \n Sternberg and OHara \n proposed a framework of possible relationships between creativity and intelligence \n Creativity is a subset of intelligence \n Intelligence is a subset of creativity \n Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs \n Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets \n Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets \n Creativity as a subset of intelligence \n A number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence \n Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence \n Gardners \n Theory of multiple intelligences \n MIT \n implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT To demonstrate this Gardner cited examples of different famous creators each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e g Picasso spatial intelligence Freud intrapersonal Einstein logical-mathematical and Gandhi interpersonal \n Sternbergs Theory of Successful intelligence \n see \n Triarchic theory of intelligence \n includes creativity as a main component and comprises sub-theories Componential Analytic Contextual Practical and Experiential Creative Experiential sub-theory the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems is directly related to creativity \n The \n CattellHornCarroll theory \n includes creativity as a subset of intelligence Specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include \n ideational fluency associational fluency and originality/creativity Silvia et al \n conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor Martindale \n extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased \n The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence \n posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence Type is a conscious process and concerns goal directed thoughts which are explained by \n g \n Type is an unconscious process and concerns spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type and Type processes working together in combination The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees \n Intelligence as a subset of creativity \n In this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity \n Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity \n Sternberg & Lubarts Investment Theory \n Using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors they buy low and sell high in their ideas Like under/low-valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people The creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value After convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people and moves onto generating another idea According to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence knowledge thinking styles personality motivation and environment Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts \n Amabiles Componential Model of Creativity \n In this model there are within-individual components needed for creativity domain-relevant skills creativity-relevant processes and task motivation and component external to the individual their surrounding social environment Creativity requires a confluence of all components High creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment \n Amusement Park Theoretical Model \n In this 4-step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role \n To get into the amusement park there are initial requirements e g time/transport to go to the park Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity They are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour \n Secondly are the subcomponents general thematic areas that increase in specificity Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e g a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e g poetry \n Thirdly there are specific domains After choosing the type of park to visit e g waterpark you then have to choose which specific park to go to Within the poetry domain there are many different types e g free verse riddles sonnet etc that have to be selected from \n Lastly there are micro-domains These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e g individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark \n Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs \n This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs \n Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs \n Renzullis Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness \n In this conceptualisation giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment Under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions \n PASS theory of intelligence \n In this theory the planning component relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity \n Threshold Theory TT A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120 Above this threshold of an IQ of if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak \n TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity \n In support of the TT Barron \n reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample Yamamoto \n in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of \n r \n = and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children Fuchs-Beauchamp et al \n in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from \n r \n = to \n r \n = in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold the correlations were \n r \n = < Cho et al \n reported a correlation of between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults and a correlation of close to \n r \n = for the high IQ group Jauk et al \n found support for the TT but only for measures of creative potential not creative performance \n Much modern day research reports findings against TT Wai et al \n in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood found that differences in SAT scores at age were predictive of creative real-life outcomes years later Kims \n meta-analysis of studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of Preckel et al \n investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of \n r \n = to \n r \n = across all levels of cognitive ability \n Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets \n Under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity Thus creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing Perkins \n referred to this as the nothing-special view \n Weisberg & Alba \n examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem see \n Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle \n where the participants are asked to connect all dots in the rows of dots using straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required \n Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets \n In this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs \n Getzels and Jackson \n administered creativity measures to a group of children from grades 6-12 and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was \n r \n = The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers The high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20% for IQ but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated \n However this work has been heavily criticised Wallach and Kogan \n highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills McNemar \n noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from different IQ tests \n Wallach and Kogan \n administered measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and measures of general intelligence to 5th grade children These tests were untimed and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average \n r \n = Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average \n r \n = with each other Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated \n r \n = \n Neuroscience \n The \n neuroscience \n of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour It has been addressed \n in the article \"Creative Innovation Possible Brain Mechanisms \" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected \" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways \n they have a high level of specialized knowledge \n they are capable of \n divergent thinking \n mediated by the \n frontal lobe \n and they are able to modulate \n neurotransmitters \n such as \n norepinephrine \n in their frontal lobe \n Thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the \n cortex \n that is most important for creativity \n This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep \n mood \n and \n addiction disorders \n and \n depression \n In Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive Drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the \n temporal lobes \n and \n dopamine \n from the \n limbic system \n The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa High dopamine levels increase general \n arousal \n and goal directed behaviors and reduce \n latent inhibition \n and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas \n A study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other \n default mode network \n functions \n Working memory and the cerebellum \n Vandervert \n described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the \n cerebellum \n collaborate to produce creativity and innovation Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of \n working memory \n responsible for processing all thought \n are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum \n The cerebellum consisting of billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain \n is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes \n where creative and innovative thoughts arise \n Apparently creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe \n According to Vandervert the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC \n New hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion \n Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the \n child prodigy \n and thought in general \n Essentially Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem \n Most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans \n Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimizes efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology \n Prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself Further Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the \n Khan Academy \n The model proposed by Vandervert has however received incisive critique from several authors \n REM sleep \n Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement Sleep aids this process \n REM \n rather than \n NREM sleep \n appears to be responsible \n This has been suggested to be due to changes in \n cholinergic \n and \n noradrenergic \n neuromodulation \n that occurs during REM sleep \n During this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the \n hippocampus \n suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the \n neocortex \n and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus \n This is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes \" \n Affect \n Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence As noted in \n voting behavior \n the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making \n Positive affect relations \n According to \n Alice Isen \n positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity \n Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association \n Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem \n Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated Together these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity \n Barbara Fredrickson \n in her \n broaden-and-build \n model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity \n According to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope \n Various meta-analyses such as Baas et al of studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect \n Creativity and artificial intelligence \n Jrgen Schmidhuber \n 's formal \n theory \n of creativity \n postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple \n computational \n principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own \n sensory \n inputs The agent can use a \n black box \n optimization method such as \n reinforcement learning \n to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future \n reward \n signals There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry But Schmidhuber's \n objective function \n to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects \" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals A wow-effect is formally defined as follows As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an \n artificial neural network \n or some other \n machine learning \n device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time The improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in \n data compression \n or computational speed It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects Irregular random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress and thus are \"boring\" by nature providing no reward Already known and predictable regularities also are boring Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations This motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration \n According to Schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and \n comedians \n For example \n physicists \n are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished \n physical laws \n permitting better \n data compression \n Likewise composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements Similarly a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected \n punch line \n related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data \" \n Schmidhuber argues that ongoing \n computer hardware \n advances will greatly scale up rudimentary \n artificial \n scientists and artists \n clarification needed \n based on simple implementations of the basic principle since \n He used the theory to create \n low-complexity art \n and an attractive \n human face \n Mental health \n Creativity and mental illness \n A study by psychologist \n J Philippe Rushton \n found creativity to correlate with \n intelligence \n and \n psychoticism \n Another study found creativity to be greater in \n schizotypal \n than in either normal or \n schizophrenic \n individuals While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the \n prefrontal cortex \n schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their \n right \n prefrontal cortex \n This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate In agreement with this hypothesis \n ambidexterity \n is also associated with \n schizotypal \n and \n schizophrenic \n individuals Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal \n and hypomanic personality \n and several different measures of creativity \n Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and \n mood disorders \n particularly \n manic-depressive disorder \n a k a \n bipolar disorder \n and \n depressive disorder \n a k a \n unipolar disorder \n In \n Touched with Fire Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament \n Kay Redfield Jamison \n summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in \n writers \n poets \n and \n artists \n She also explores research that identifies \n mood disorders \n in such famous writers and artists as \n Ernest Hemingway \n who shot himself after \n electroconvulsive treatment \n Virginia Woolf \n who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer \n Robert Schumann \n who died in a mental institution and even the famed \n visual artist \n Michelangelo \n A study looking at persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder There was no overall overrepresentation but overrepresentation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives \n Another study involving more than one million people conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder \n However as a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports \n According to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress \n Creativity and personality \n Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth innovation speed etc These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals \n i \n Incubate \n Long-term Development \n ii \n Imagine \n Breakthrough Ideas \n iii \n Improve \n Incremental Adjustments \n iv \n Invest \n Short-term Goals \n Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at \n Manchester Business School \n has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each \n i \"Idea Generation\" Fluency Originality Incubation and Illumination \n ii \"Personality\" Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity \n iii \"Motivation\" Intrinsic Extrinsic and Achievement \n iv \"Confidence\" Producing Sharing and Implementing \n This model was developed in a sample of working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling \n An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterised by the \n psychometric \n approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference \n One characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called \n divergent production \n Divergent production \n is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation \n One way of measuring \n divergent production \n is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \n The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions \n Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways In a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects \n The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person Motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people \n From a personality-traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people \n Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self-accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity \n From an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas As ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments As a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society \n In studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found Creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non-nurturing Most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination \n Another theory of creative people is the \n investment theory of creativity \n This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity In the \n investment \n sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea Just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected This \n investment theory of creativity \n views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way \n Malevolent creativity \n Malevolent creativity MC focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity \n This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism However MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal \n Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving The personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC \n Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions They concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individuals expression of malevolent creativity \n The current measure for malevolent creativity is the item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale MCBS \n Malevolent creativity and crime \n Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime As creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime \n Creativity across cultures \n Creativity is viewed differently in different countries \n For example cross-cultural research centred on \n Hong Kong \n found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e g what they can contribute to society \n Mpofu et al surveyed African languages and found that had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' the exception being \n Arabic \n The principle of \n linguistic relativity \n i e that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages However more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative \n Africa \n has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as \n music \n art \n and \n storytelling \n Nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa \n and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America \n Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity For example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges \n while in Germany creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems \n In organizations \n Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in \n Brazil \n The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity \n It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent For any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands Thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes \n Amabile \n argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed \n Expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledge \n Creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems \n and Motivation especially \n intrinsic motivation \n There are two types of motivation \n extrinsic motivation \n external \n factors for example \n threats \n of being fired or money as a reward \n intrinsic motivation \n comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc \n Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are \n Challenge matching people with the right assignments \n Freedom giving people \n autonomy \n choosing means to achieve goals \n Resources \n such as time money space etc There must be balance fit among resources and people \n Work group features \n diverse \n supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each other's talents \n Supervisory \n encouragement recognitions cheering praising \n Organizational support value emphasis information sharing \n collaboration \n Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations \n In particular he emphasized the role that \n tacit knowledge \n has to play in the creative process \n In business \n originality \n is not enough The idea must also be appropriateuseful and \n actionable \n Creative competitive intelligence \n is a new solution to solve this problem According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to \n innovation \n process and \n competitive intelligence \n to creative workers \n Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace It is essential for innovation and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses In the sociologist Silvia Leal Martn using the Innova 3DX method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear \n Similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation \n The investigation by Loo \n on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page It offers connections with the sections on the Four C model Theories of creative processes Creativity as a subset of intelligence Creativity and personality and In organisations It is the last section that the investigation addresses \n Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels macro meso and micro Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension Meso studies focus on organisations Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses e g Burton-Jones Drucker economics e g Cortada Reich Florida education e g Farrell and Fenwick Brown Lauder and Ashton human resource management e g Davenport knowledge and organizational management Alvesson Defillippi Arthur and Lindsay Orr Nutley Russell Bain Hacking and Moran sociology psychology and knowledge economy-related sectors especially information technology IT software e g ORiain Nerland and advertising e g Grabher Lury Loo \n Loo studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives Specifically the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising and systems software developing and software programme managing \n The study offers a conceptual framework Loo p of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles and single and multi-contexts The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics e g Reich Quah management e g Drucker Nonaka and Takeuchi von Hippel sociology e g Zuboff Bell Lash and Urry Castells Knorr Cetina and psychology e g Gardner Csikszentmihalyi Sternberg Kaufman and Pretz The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work These workers apply their cognitive abilities creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science technology or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities e g a medium product or service These work activities may be done individually or collectively Education training and encultured environments are necessary for the performance of these creative activities Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner and creating something that is different and novel i e a variation on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives \n This investigation identifies a definition of creative work three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination problem-solving problem seeking and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example for a creative director in the advertising industry it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector In addition to the creative applications creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles Passion for ones job is generic For copywriters this passion is identified with fun enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product confidence and patience in finding the appropriate copy Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities e g literature the creative arts e g painting and music and technical-related know-how e g mathematics computer sciences and physical sciences In the IT software technical knowledge of computer languages e g C+++ is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers \n There are three types of work One is intra-sectoral e g general sponge and in tune with the zeitgeist advertising and power of expression and sensitivity IT software The second is inter-sectoral e g integration of advertising activities advertising and autonomous decentralized systems ADS IT software The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors e g three-dimensional trust and green credentials advertising and collaboration with HEIs and industry and ADS system in the Tokyo train operator IT software \n The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information communications and electronic technologies ICET infrastructure training work environment and education \n This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure delivery approaches and assessments At a macro level governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally and foster an environment which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation \n Team Composition \n Diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways However under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives \n Thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity \n Team Processes \n Team communication \n norms \n such as respecting others expertise paying attention to others ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements \n negotiating \n remaining open to others ideas learning from others and building on each others ideas increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with \n brainstorming \n and \n problem solving \n Through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team \n affect \n which facilitates collective creativity \n Organizational Culture \n Supportive and motivational environments that create \n psychological safety \n by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well \n Organizations in which \n help-seeking \n help giving \n and \n collaboration \n are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur \n Additionally \n leadership styles \n that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity \n Economic views of creativity \n Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modelling markets for creativity and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation \n In the early 20th century \n Joseph Schumpeter \n introduced the economic theory of \n creative destruction \n to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new Some economists such as \n Paul Romer \n view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth Creativity leads to \n capital \n and creative products are protected by \n intellectual property \n laws \n Mark A Runco \n and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \" \n psychoeconomic \n \" model of creativity \n In such a model creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive \n utility \n and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations \n The \n creative class \n is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies In his book \n The Rise of the Creative Class \n economist \n Richard Florida \n popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development Technology Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of \n creative professionals \n and tend to have a higher level of economic development \n Fostering creativity \n Creativity techniques \n Daniel Pink in his book \n A Whole New Mind \n repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important In this \n conceptual age \n we will need to foster and encourage \n right-directed thinking \n representing creativity and emotion over \n left-directed thinking \n representing logical analytical thought However this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data \n Nickerson \n provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry \n Establishing purpose and intention \n Building basic skills \n Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge \n Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration \n Building motivation especially internal motivation \n Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks \n Focusing on mastery and self-competition \n Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity \n Providing opportunities for choice and discovery \n Developing self-management metacognitive skills \n Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance \n Providing balance \n Some see the conventional system of \n schooling \n as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt particularly in the \n preschool \n / \n kindergarten \n and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly rich imagination-fostering environment for young children \n Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise \n In addition to helping with problem solving creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so \n See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought \n Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake \n To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks \n Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it \n Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual Such ideas range from the \n psychological \n -cognitive such as \n Osborn \n - \n Parnes \n Creative Problem Solving Process \n Synectics \n science-based creative thinking Purdue Creative Thinking Program and \n Edward de Bono \n 's \n lateral thinking \n to the highly structured such as \n TRIZ \n the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist \n Genrich Altshuller \n and Computer-Aided \n morphological analysis \n Creativity has also been identified as one of the key \n 21st century skills \n and as one of the \n Four Cs of 21st century learning \n by educational leaders and theorists in the United States \n List of academic journals addressing creativity \n Creativity Research Journal \n Creativity Theories Research - Applications \n International Journal of

or \n troth \n in Wiktionary the free dictionary \n Loyalty \n the definition of loyalty in \n law \n and \n political science \n is the fidelity of an individual to a \n nation \n either one's nation of birth or one's declared home nation by \n oath \n nationalization \n In general use loyalty is a \n devotion \n and \n faithfulness \n to a nation cause philosophy \n country \n group or \n person \n Philosophers \n disagree on what can be an object of loyalty as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human \n being \n can be the object of loyalty \n John Kleinig professor of \n philosophy \n at \n City University of New York \n observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from \n Aeschylus \n through \n John Galsworthy \n to \n Joseph Conrad \n by psychologists psychiatrists sociologists scholars of religion political economists scholars of business and marketing andmost particularlyby political theorists who deal with it in terms of \n loyalty oaths \n and \n patriotism \n As a philosophical concept loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of \n Josiah Royce \n the \"grand exception\" in Kleinig's words \n John Ladd professor of philosophy at \n Brown University \n writing in the Macmillan \n Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n in observes that by that time the subject had received \"scant attention in philosophical literature\" This he attributed to \"odious\" associations that the subject had with \n nationalism \n including \n Nazism \n and with the metaphysics of \n idealism \n which he characterized as \"obsolete\" However he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is \"an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals\" \n Kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards the subject gained attention with philosophers variously relating it to \n professional ethics \n whistleblowing \n friendship \n and \n virtue theory \n Historical concepts \n Western world \n East Asia \n Modern concepts \n The proper object of loyalty \n Multiplicity disloyalty and whether loyalty is exclusionary \n Other dimensions \n In relation to other subjects \n Patriotism \n Whistleblowing \n Marketing \n In the Bible \n Misplaced \n In animals \n Further reading \n Historical concepts \n Western world \n Further information \n Semper fidelis \n In Treue fest \n Fidelity \n and \n Tryggvi \n Classical \n tragedy \n is often based on a conflict arising from \n dual loyalty \n Euthyphro \n one of \n Plato \n 's early dialogues is based on the ethical dilemma arising from Euthyphro intending to lay manslaughter charges against his own father who had caused the death of a slave through negligence \n In the \n Gospel of Matthew \n Jesus states \"No one can serve two masters Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other Ye cannot serve God and \n mammon \n \" This relates to the authority of a master over his servants as per \n Ephesians \n who according to \n Biblical law \n owe undivided loyalty to their master as per Leviticus \n On the other hand the \" \n Render unto Caesar \n \" of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties secular and religious without conflict but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to God the latter takes precedence \n The \n Encyclopdia Britannica \n Eleventh Edition \n defines loyalty as \"allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one's country\" and also \"personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family\" It traces the word \" \n loyalty \n \" to the 15th century noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service in love or to an \n oath \n that one has made The meaning that the \n Britannica \n gives as primary it attributes to a shift during the 16th century noting that the origin of the word is in the \n Old French \n \" \n loialte \n \" that is in turn rooted in the \n Latin \n \" \n lex \n \" meaning \" \n law \n \" One who is loyal in the \n feudal \n sense of \n fealty \n is one who is lawful as opposed to an \n outlaw \n who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful \n allegiance \n to a feudal lord Hence the \n Britannica \n derived its early 20th century primary meaning of loyalty to a \n monarch \n East Asia \n Zhong \n clarification needed \n Often cited as one of the many virtues of \n Confucianism \n meaning to do the best you can do for others \n \"Loyalty\" is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in \n Bushido \n It combines other six virtues such as Righteousness \n gi? \n Courage \n y? \n Benevolence \n jin? \n Respect \n rei? \n Sincerity \n makoto? \n Honour \n meiyo? \n and formed the Bushido code \"It is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal\" \n Modern concepts \n Josiah Royce \n presented a different definition of the concept in his book \n The Philosophy of Loyalty \n According to Royce loyalty is a \n virtue \n indeed a primary virtue \"the heart of all the virtues the central duty amongst all the duties\" Royce presents loyalty which he defines at length as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived \n The short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is \"the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause\" \n Loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause \n Royce's view of loyalty was challenged by Ladd in the article on \"Loyalty\" in the first edition of the Macmillan \n Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n Ralls observes that Ladd's article is the Macmillan \n Encyclopaedia \n ' \n s only article on a virtue and praises it for its \"magnificent\" declaration by Ladd that \"a loyal Nazi is a contradiction in terms\" \n Ladd asserts that contrary to Royce causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal not impersonal or suprapersonal \n He states that Royce's view has \"the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men The individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into 'superhuman' good\" Ronald F Duska the Lamont Post Chair of Ethics and the Professions at \n The American College \n extends Ladd's objection saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one's self-will to be identified with anything as Royce would have it Even if one were identifying one's self-will with God to be worthy of such loyalty God would have to be the \n summum bonum \n the perfect manifestation of good \n Ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal i e a relationship between a lord and vassal parent and child or two good friends Duska states that doing so leads to a problem that Ladd overlooks Loyalty may certainly be between two persons but it may also be from a person to a group of people Examples of this which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty are loyalty by a person to his/her family to a team that he/she is a member/fan of or to his/her country The problem with this that Duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved and whether Ladd's contention that loyalty is interpersonalnot suprapersonalis an adequate description \n Ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives its proper object and its moral value \n Additional aspects enumerated by Kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects \n The proper object of loyalty \n Ladd and others including \n Milton R Konvitz \n yearneeded \n and Marcia W Baron \n disagree amongst themselves as to the proper \n object of \n loyaltywhat it is possible to be loyal \n to \n in other words Ladd as stated considers loyalty to be interpersonal and that the object of loyalty is always a person In the \n Encyclopaedia of the History of Ideas \n Konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles causes ideas ideals religions ideologies nations governments parties leaders families friends regions racial groups and \"anyone or anything to which one's heart can become attached or devoted\" Baron agrees with Ladd inasmuch as loyalty is \"to certain people or to a group of people not loyalty to an ideal or cause\" She argues in her \n monograph \n The Moral Status of Loyalty \n that \" w hen we speak of causes or ideals we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them\" Kleinig agrees with Baron noting that a person's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values causes and ideals He disagrees however with the notion that loyalties are restricted \n solely \n to personal attachments considering it \"incorrect as a matter of logic \" \n Loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an \n evolutionary tactic \n as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs \n Multiplicity disloyalty and whether loyalty is exclusionary \n Stephen Nathanson professor of Philosophy at \n Northeastern University \n states that loyalty can be either \n exclusionary \n or \n non-exclusionary \n and can be \n single \n or \n multiple \n Exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not People may have single loyalties to just one person group or thing or multiple loyalties to multiple objects Multiple loyalties can constitute a \n disloyalty \n to an object if one of those loyalties is \n exclusionary \n excluding one of the others However Nathanson observes this is a special case In the general case the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty One can for example be loyal to one's friends or one's family and still without contradiction be loyal to one's religion or profession \n Other dimensions \n In addition to \n number \n and \n exclusion \n as just outlined Nathanson enumerates five other \"dimensions\" that loyalty can vary along basis strength scope legitimacy and attitude \n Loyalties differ in \n basis \n according to their foundations They may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty such as biological ties or place of birth a notion of natural allegiance propounded by \n Socrates \n in his political theory Alternatively they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom The degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple Nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one's parents or relatives one \n can \n choose to desert them \n Loyalties differ in \n strength \n They can range from supreme loyalties that override all other considerations to merely presumptive loyalties that affect one's presumptions providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations Nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis \" \n Blood is thicker than water \n \" states an aphorism explaining that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger \n Loyalties differ in \n scope \n They range from loyalties with limited scope that require few actions of the subject to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes which require many actions or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty Loyalty to one's job for example may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires Loyalty to a family member can in contrast have a very broad effect upon one's actions requiring considerable personal sacrifice Extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties Scope encompasses an element of \n constraint \n Where two or more loyalties conflict their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty \n Loyalties differ in \n legitimacy \n This is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties People with one loyalty can hold that another conflicting loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate In the extreme view one that Nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples all loyalties bar one's own are considered illegitimate The xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions At the other end of the spectrum past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not according to cases or plain and simple indifference to other people's loyalties is the positive regard of other people's loyalties \n Finally loyalties differ in the \n attitude \n that the subjects of the loyalties have towards other people Note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the \n subjects \n of the loyalty whereas legitimacy above concerns the loyalties themselves People may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties with hate and disdain at one end indifference in the middle and concern and positive feeling at the other \n In relation to other subjects \n Patriotism \n Patriotism \n Nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism He states that this is however not actually the case arguing that whilst patriots exhibit loyalty it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots He provides the example of a \n mercenary \n soldier who exhibits loyalty to the people/country that pays him Nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot A mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of \n professionalism \n or a belief in the sanctity of \n contracts \n A patriot in contrast may be motivated by affection concern identification and a willingness to sacrifice \n Nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue A loyal person can in general be relied upon and hence people view loyalty as virtuous Nathanson argues that loyalty can however be given to persons or causes that are unworthy Moreover loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane Thus Nathanson argues patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable Such loyalties in Nathanson's view are erroneously \n unlimited \n in their scopes and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality \n Whistleblowing \n Whistleblowing \n Several scholars including Duska discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing Wim Vandekerckhove of the \n University of Greenwich \n points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a \n bidirectional \n loyaltybetween employees and their employer Previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer but not that an employer need be loyal to employees The ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his/her community which the employer's business practices may be adversely affecting Vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways some of which he himself does not find to be satisfactory Duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances the community a position that Vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty \n John Corvino associate professor of Philosophy at \n Wayne State University \n takes a different tack arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice not a virtue and that \"loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good\" similar to Nathanson Vandekerckhove calls this argument \"interesting\" but \"too vague\" in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer's shortcomings Vandekerckhove suggests that Duska and Corvino combine however to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing by clarifying the objects of those loyalties \n Marketing \n Loyalty business model \n Businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers \n Brand loyalty \n is a consumer's preference for a particular \n brand \n and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand \n Loyalty programs \n offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits \n One similar concept is \n fan loyalty \n an allegiance to and abiding interest in a \n sports team \n fictional character \n or fictional series Devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons \n In the Bible \n Attempting to serve two masters leads to double-mindedness \n James \n undermining loyalty to a cause The \n Bible \n also speaks of loyal ones which would be those who follow the Bible with absolute loyalty as in \"Precious in the eyes of God is the death of his loyal ones\" \n Psalms \n Most Jewish and Christian authors view the \n binding of Isaac \n Genesis \n in which \n Abraham \n was called by God to offer his son Isaac as a \n burnt offering \n as a test of Abraham's loyalty \n Joseph \n 's faithfulness to his master \n Potiphar \n and his rejection of Potiphar's wife's advances \n Genesis \n have also been called an example of the virtue of loyalty \n Misplaced \n Misplaced loyalty \n Misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or \n organisations \n where that loyalty is not acknowledged or \n respected \n is \n betrayed \n or taken advantage of It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause \n Social psychology \n provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way \"the \n norm of social commitment \n directs us to honor our agreements People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse\" \n Humanists \n point out that \"man inherits the capacity for loyalty but not the use to which he shall put it may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile as he may to what is generous and noble\" \n In animals \n Foxie guarding the body of her master \n Charles Gough \n in \n Attachment \n by \n Edwin Landseer \n Animals as \n pets \n have a large sense of loyalty to humans Famous cases include \n Greyfriars Bobby \n who attended his master's grave for fourteen years \n Hachiko \n who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his \n death \n and Foxie the \n spaniel \n belonging to \n Charles Gough \n who stayed by her dead master's side for three months on \n Helvellyn \n in the \n Lake District \n in although it is possible that Foxie had eaten Gough's body \n In the \n Mahabharata \n the righteous King \n Yudhishthira \n appears at the gates of Heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death The god \n Indra \n is prepared to admit him to Heaven but refuses to admit the dog so Yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog and prepares to turn away from the gates of Heaven Then the dog is revealed to be the manifestation of \n Dharma \n the god of righteousness and justice and who turned out to be his deified self Yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog the god of righteousness \n Yudhishthira is known by the \n epithet \n Dharmaputra the lord of righteous duty"},

concept of \n fair \n and \n just \n relations between the \n individual \n and \n society \n This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the \n distribution of wealth \n opportunities for personal activity and \n social privileges \n In \n Western \n as well as in older \n Asian cultures \n the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their \n societal roles \n and receive what was their due from society \n In the current global \n grassroots \n movements for social justice the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for \n social mobility \n the creation of \n safety nets \n and \n economic justice \n Social justice assigns rights and duties in the \n institutions \n of society which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation The relevant institutions often include \n taxation \n social insurance \n public health \n public school \n public services \n labour law \n and \n regulation \n of \n markets \n to ensure \n fair \n distribution of wealth \n and \n equal opportunity \n Interpretations that relate justice to a \n reciprocal relationship \n to society are mediated by differences in cultural traditions some of which emphasize the individual responsibility toward society and others the equilibrium between access to power and its responsible use \n Hence social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures such as \n Bartolom de las Casas \n in philosophical debates about differences among human beings in efforts for gender racial and \n social equality \n for advocating justice for \n migrants \n prisoners the \n environment \n and the physically and developmentally \n disabled \n While the concept of social justice can be traced through the theology of \n Augustine of Hippo \n and the philosophy of \n Thomas Paine \n the term \"social justice\" became used explicitly from the 1840s A \n Jesuit \n priest named \n Luigi Taparelli \n is typically credited with coining the term and it spread during the \n revolutions of \n with the work of \n Antonio Rosmini-Serbati \n In the late industrial revolution \n progressive \n American legal scholars began to use the term more particularly \n Louis Brandeis \n and \n Roscoe Pound \n From the early 20th century it was also embedded in \n international law \n and institutions the preamble to establish the \n International Labour Organization \n recalled that \"universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice \" In the

education \n Notes \n Articles \n Books \n Main articles \n Social contract \n Justice \n Corrective justice \n and \n Distributive justice \n The different concepts of \n justice \n as discussed in ancient \n Western philosophy \n were typically centered upon the community \n Plato \n Plato \n wrote in \n The Republic \n that it would be an ideal state that \"every member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted \" \n In an article for J N V University author D R Bhandari says \"Justice is for Plato at once a part of human virtue and the bond which joins man together in society It is the identical quality that makes good and social Justice is an order and duty of the parts of the soul it is to the soul as health is to the body Plato says that justice is not mere strength but it is a harmonious strength Justice is not the right of the stronger but the effective harmony of the whole All moral conceptions revolve about the good of the whole-individual as well as social\" \n Aristotle \n Aristotle \n believed rights existed only between free people and the law should take \"account in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality \" Reflecting this time when \n slavery \n and subjugation of women was typical ancient views of justice tended to reflect the rigid class systems that still prevailed On the other hand for the privileged groups strong concepts of fairness and the community existed \n Distributive justice \n was said by \n Aristotle \n to require that people were distributed goods and assets according to their merit \n Socrates \n Socrates \n through \n Plato \n 's dialogue \n Crito \n is attributed with developing the idea of a \n social contract \n whereby people ought to follow the rules of a society and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits \n During the Middle Ages religious scholars particularly such as \n Thomas Aquinas \n continued discussion of justice in various ways but ultimately connected being a good citizen to the purpose of serving God \n After the \n Renaissance \n and \n Reformation \n the modern concept of social justice as developing human potential began to emerge through the work of a series of authors \n Baruch Spinoza \n in \n On the Improvement of the Understanding \n contended that the one true aim of life should be to acquire \"a human character much more stable than one's own\" and to achieve this \"pitch of perfection The chief good is that he should arrive together with other individuals if possible at the possession of the aforesaid character \" \n During the \n enlightenment \n and responding to the \n French \n and \n American Revolutions \n Thomas Paine \n similarly wrote in \n The Rights of Man \n society should give \"genius a fair and universal chance\" and so \"the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions \" \n Social justice \n was coined by \n Jesuit \n priest \n Luigi Taparelli \n in the 1840s \n The first modern usage of the specific term \"social justice\" is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s including the \n Jesuit \n Luigi Taparelli \n in \n Civilt Cattolica \n based on the work of St \n Thomas Aquinas \n He argued that rival \n capitalist \n and \n socialist \n theories based on subjective \n Cartesian \n thinking undermined the unity of society present in \n Thomistic \n metaphysics \n as neither were sufficiently concerned with \n moral \n philosophy \n Writing in the influential British philosopher and economist \n John Stuart Mill \n stated in \n Utilitarianism \n his view that \"Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it that is who have deserved equally well absolutely This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice towards which all institutions and the efforts of all virtuous citizens should be made in the utmost degree to converge \" \n In the later 19th and early 20th century social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy particularly in the work of \n John Dewey \n Roscoe Pound \n and \n Louis Brandeis \n One of the prime concerns was the \n Lochner era \n decisions of the \n US Supreme Court \n to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement such as the \n eight-hour day \n or the right to join a \n trade union \n After the First World War the founding document of the \n International Labour Organization \n took up the same terminology in its preamble stating that \"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\" From this point the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse In the late 20th century a number of liberal and conservative thinkers notably \n Friedrich von Hayek \n rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything or meant too many things \n However the concept remained highly influential particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as \n John Rawls \n Contemporary theory \n Philosophical perspectives \n Cosmic values \n Hunter Lewis \n ' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for \n conservation \n as a key premise in social justice His manifesto on \n sustainability \n ties the continued thriving of human life to real conditions the environment supporting that life and associates injustice with the detrimental effects of \n unintended consequences \n of human actions Quoting classical Greek thinkers like \n Epicurus \n on the good of pursuing happiness Hunter also cites ornithologist naturalist and philosopher \n Alexander Skutch \n in his book Moral Foundations \n The common feature which unites the activities most consistently forbidden by the moral codes of civilized peoples is that by their very nature they cannot be both habitual and enduring because they tend to destroy the conditions which make them possible \n Pope Benedict XVI cites \n Teilhard de Chardin \n in a vision of the cosmos as a 'living host' \n embracing an understanding of ecology that includes humanity's relationship to others that pollution affects not just the natural world but interpersonal relations as well Cosmic harmony justice and peace are closely interrelated \n If you want to cultivate peace protect creation \n John Rawls \n John Rawls \n Political philosopher \n John Rawls \n draws on the \n utilitarian \n insights of \n Bentham \n and \n Mill \n the \n social contract \n ideas of \n John Locke \n and the \n categorical imperative \n ideas of \n Kant \n His first statement of principle was made in \n A Theory of Justice \n where he proposed that \"Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others \" \n A \n deontological \n proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in \n absolutist \n terms His views are definitively restated in \n Political Liberalism \n where society is seen \"as a fair system of co-operation over time from one generation to the next\" \n All societies have a basic structure of social economic and political institutions both formal and informal In testing how well these elements fit and work together Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding Obviously not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement \n The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes and to that extent X holds these powers as a \n trustee \n for the citizen \n X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate The citizen therefore is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way \n This applies to one person who represents a small group e g the organiser of a social event setting a dress code as equally as it does to national governments which are ultimate trustees holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries Governments that fail to provide for \n welfare \n of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments Rawls asserted that \"There is a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty \" \n This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold to some extent the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome According to Rawls the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are \n Freedom of thought \n Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion philosophy and morality \n Political liberties e g representative democratic institutions \n freedom of speech \n and the \n press \n and \n freedom of assembly \n Freedom of association \n Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person namely freedom from slavery freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation and \n Rights and liberties covered by the \n rule of law \n Thomas Pogge \n Thomas Pogge \n 's arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable Pogge argues that social institutions have a \n negative duty \n to not harm the poor \n Pogge speaks of \"institutional cosmopolitanism\" and assigns responsibility to institutional schemes \n for deficits of human rights An example given is slavery and third parties A third party should not recognize or enforce slavery The institutional order should be held responsible only for deprivations of human rights that it establishes or authorizes The current institutional design he says systematically harms developing economies by enabling corporate tax evasion \n illicit financial flows corruption trafficking of people and weapons \n Joshua Cohen \n disputes his claims based on the fact that some poor countries have done well with the current institutional design \n Elizabeth Kahn argues that some of these responsibilities \n vague \n should apply globally \n United Nations \n The United Nations document \n Social Justice in an Open World The Role of the United Nations \n states that \"Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth \" \n The term \"social justice\" was seen by the U N \"as a substitute for the protection of human rights and first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s At the initiative of the Soviet Union and with the support of developing countries the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development adopted in \" \n The same document reports \"From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the \n Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence repression and chaos \" \n The report concludes \"Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent \n redistributive policies \n conceived and implemented by public agencies \" \n The same UN document offers a concise history \" T he notion of social justice is relatively new None of historys great philosophersnot Plato or Aristotle or Confucius or Averroes or even Rousseau or Kantsaw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist \n exploitation of labour \n and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists By the mid-twentieth century the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world \" \n Religious perspectives \n Hinduism \n The present-day \n Jti \n hierarchy is undergoing changes for a variety of reasons including 'social justice' which is a politically popular stance in democratic India Institutionalized affirmative action has promoted this The disparity and wide inequalities in social behaviour of the jtis exclusive endogamous communities centred on traditional occupations has led to various \n reform movements \n in \n Hinduism \n While legally outlawed the caste system remains strong in practice \n Islam \n The \n Quran \n contains numerous references to elements of social justice For example one of Islam's Five Pillars is \n Zakt \n or alms-giving Charity and assistance to the poor concepts central to social justice are and have historically been important parts of the Islamic faith \n In Muslim history Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the \n Abbasid revolt \n against the Umayyads \n The Shi'a believe that the return of the \n Mahdi \n will herald in \"the messianic age of justice\" and the Mahdi along with the Isa Jesus will end plunder torture oppression and discrimination \n For the \n Muslim Brotherhood \n the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of \n consumerism \n and \n communism \n The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work However the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need It held that \n zakat \n alms-giving was not voluntary charity but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate \n Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the \n zakat \n through taxes \n Though monetary donations are the most practiced way of \n zakat \n Islam is deeply rooted in the tenets of \n volunteerism \n and \n social activism \n Areas of one's communities which require assistance and beneficiaries must be a Muslim's foci if need be rather than strictly her or his personal or superficial wants For example the \n ecological \n well-being of the planet i e animal rights global warming natural resources degradation locally nationally globally is a campaign to which every Muslim must adhere Many Muslims practice this today by ensuring that they produce minimal waste give to charity what they no longer need and spend time in prayer and meditation upon the bounties of nature so as to more mindfully approach all that is provided by nature and ultimately \n Allah \n Other areas of society in need may be the safety and security of minority populations i e women or persons of color children the

role in the \n United Methodist Church \n The \n Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church \n says \"We hold governments responsible for the protection of the rights of the people to free and fair elections and to the freedoms of speech religion assembly communications media and petition for redress of grievances without fear of reprisal to the \n right to privacy \n and to the guarantee

social teaching \n Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life A distinctive feature of Catholic social doctrine is its concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society Two of the seven key areas \n of \"Catholic social teaching\" are pertinent to social justice \n Life and dignity of the human person The foundational principle of all \"Catholic Social Teaching\" is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person from conception to natural death Human life must be valued above all material possessions \n Preferential option for the poor and \n vulnerable \n Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the \n Day of Judgement \n God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy \"Amen I say to you whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine you did for me \" \n The Catholic Church believes that through words prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with and compassion for the poor The moral test of any society is \"how it treats its most vulnerable members The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor \" \n Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church \n Pope Leo XIII \n who studied under Taparelli published in the \n encyclical \n Rerum novarum \n On the Condition of the Working Classes lit \"On new things\" rejecting both socialism and capitalism while defending labor unions and private property He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not \n class conflict \n and \n competition \n In this document Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony \n The encyclical \n Quadragesimo anno \n On Reconstruction of the Social Order literally \"in the fortieth year\" of by \n Pope Pius XI \n encourages a \n living wage \n subsidiarity \n and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just \n Pope John Paul II \n added much to the corpus of the \n Catholic social teaching \n penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics politics geo-political situations ownership of the means of production private property and the \" \n social mortgage \n \" and private property The encyclicals \n Laborem exercens \n Sollicitudo rei socialis \n and \n Centesimus annus \n are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and \n human rights \n and spoke forcefully for the poor He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused and admits a fear that the \"progress\" of the world is not true progress at all if it should denigrate the value of the human person He argued in \n Centesimus annus \n that private property markets and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person \n Pope Benedict XVI \n 's encyclical \n Deus caritas est \n \"God is Love\" of claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics and not of the church which has charity as its central social concern It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate using reason and natural law and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics \n The official Catholic doctrine on \n social justice \n can be found in the book \n Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \n published in and updated in by the \n Pontifical Council \n Iustitia et Pax \n The Catechism contain more detail of the Church's view of social justice \n Criticism \n Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice \n Moral relativists \n deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general \n Non-cognitivists \n moral skeptics \n moral nihilists \n and most \n logical positivists \n deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice \n Political realists \n believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the \n status quo \n citation needed \n Many other people accept some of the basic principles of social justice such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this One example is the statement by \n H G Wells \n that all people are \"equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen \" \n On the other hand some scholars reject the very idea of social justice as meaningless religious self-contradictory and ideological believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty Perhaps the most complete rejection of the concept of social justice comes from \n Friedrich Hayek \n of the \n Austrian School \n of economics \n There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined would appear just to us Social justice does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense like the term 'a moral stone' \n Ben O'Neill of the \n University of New South Wales \n argues that for proponents of \"social justice\" \n the notion of \"rights\" is a mere term of entitlement indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good no matter how important or trivial abstract or tangible recent or ancient It is merely an assertion of desire and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire \n In fact since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods paid for through the efforts of others the term actually refers to an intention to use \n force \n to acquire one's desires Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action production and voluntary exchange but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them! \n Janusz Korwin-Mikke \n states \"Either 'social justice' has the same meaning as 'justice' or not If so why use the additional word 'social?' We lose time we destroy trees to obtain paper necessary to print this word If not if 'social justice' means something different from 'justice' then 'something different from justice' is by definition 'injustice '\" \n citation needed \n Sociologist \n Carl L Bankston \n has argued that a secular leftist view of social justice entails viewing the redistribution of goods and resources as based on

based on the concepts of human rights and equality and can be defined as \n \"the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society\" \n A number of \n movements \n are working to achieve social justice in society These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society regardless of background or procedural justice have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society \n Liberation theology \n Liberation theology \n Liberation theology \n is a movement in \n Christian \n theology \n which conveys the teachings of \n Jesus Christ \n in terms of a liberation from unjust economic political or social conditions It has been described by proponents as \"an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering their struggle and hope and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor\" \n and by detractors as Christianity perverted by \n Marxism \n and \n Communism \n Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement it began as a movement within the \n Catholic Church \n in Latin America in the 1950s1960s It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region \n It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s The term was coined by the \n Peruvian \n priest \n Gustavo Gutirrez \n who wrote one of the movement's most famous books \n A Theology of Liberation \n According to \n Sarah Kleeb \n \"Marx would surely take issue \" she writes \"with the appropriation of his works in a religious context there is no way to reconcile Marx's views of religion with those of Gutierrez they are simply incompatible Despite this in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path the two have much in common and particularly in the first edition of A Theology of Liberation the use of Marxian theory is quite evident \" \n Other noted exponents are \n Leonardo Boff \n of Brazil \n Carlos Mugica \n of Argentina \n Jon Sobrino \n of El Salvador and \n Juan Luis Segundo \n of Uruguay \n Health care \n Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of \n bioethics \n Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care especially for low income households and families The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare \n Ruth Faden \n of the \n Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics \n and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings \n Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations \n These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level gender education or any other stratifying factors Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model

all people \n According to the \n Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or \n social status \n According to the \n Merriam-Webster Dictionary \n the term has two distinct definitions in modern English \n either as a political \n doctrine \n that all people should be treated as equals and have the same \n political \n economic \n social \n and \n civil rights \n or as a social philosophy advocating the \n removal of economic inequalities among people \n economic egalitarianism \n or the \n decentralization of power \n Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity \n Forms \n Legal egalitarianism \n Equality of person \n Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \n Gender equality \n Social egalitarianism \n Economic \n Egalitarianism and non-human animals \n Religious and spiritual egalitarianism \n Sikhism \n Christianity \n Judaism \n Islam \n Military egalitarianism \n Modern egalitarianism theory \n Reception \n Marxism \n Forms \n Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include \n communism \n legal egalitarianism \n luck egalitarianism \n political egalitarianism \n gender egalitarianism \n racial equality \n equality of outcome \n and \n Christian egalitarianism \n Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical \n Legal egalitarianism \n Further information \n equality before the law \n One argument is that \n liberalism \n provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights \n Equality of person \n The \n English Bill of Rights of \n and the \n United States Constitution \n use only the term \"person\" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities except for a a reference to \"men\" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason and b a rule of proportional Congressional representation in the \n 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \n As the rest of the Constitution in its operative language the \n 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution \n uses the term \"person\" stating for example that \" nor shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\" \n Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities \n An example of this form is the \n Tunisian Constitution of \n which provides that \"men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties\" \n Gender equality \n The motto \" \n Libert galit fraternit \n \" was used during the \n French Revolution \n and is still used as an official motto of the French government The \n Rights of Man and of the Citizen \n French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind \n The \n Declaration of Independence of the United States \n is an example of an assertion of equality of men the wording of \"men\" and \"man\" is a reference to both men and women i e \"mankind\" \n all men are created equal \n \" \n John Locke \n is sometimes considered the founder of this form \n Many state constitutions in the United States also use \"rights of man\" language rather than \"rights of person\" since the noun \"man\" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women \n It is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women \n Social egalitarianism \n At a cultural level egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are \n socialism \n communism \n social anarchism \n libertarian socialism \n left-libertarianism \n and \n progressivism \n some of which propound \n economic egalitarianism \n Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among \n intellectuals \n and in the general populations of many countries However whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question A position of opposition to egalitarianism is anti-egalitarianism \n Economic \n An early example of equality of outcome economic egalitarianism is \n Xu Xing \n a scholar of the Chinese philosophy of \n agriculturalism \n who supported the \n fixing of prices \n and in which all similar goods and services regardless of differences in quality and demand are set at exactly the same unchanging price \n In \n socialism \n social ownership \n of \n means of production \n is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership the \n surplus product \n generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another Although the economist \n Karl Marx \n is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether However Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific \n economic systems \n The American economist \n John Roemer \n has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of \n distributive justice \n shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be \n proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production \n is inadequate Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized \n Egalitarianism and non-human animals \n Many philosophers including Ingmar Persson \n Peter Vallentyne \n Nils Holtug \n and \n Lewis Gompertz \n have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that \"Egalitarianism implies rejecting \n speciesism \n and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals as well as assisting them \n in nature \n \" \n Furthermore Horta argues that \"because nonhuman animals are worse off in comparison to humans egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests nonhuman animals \" \n Religious and spiritual egalitarianism \n Sikhism \n The \n Sikh \n faith was founded upon egalitarian principles reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race but also between the genders This equality led to denunciation of sati the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the \n funeral pyres \n of deceased husbands albeit being very rare at the time but occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation than becoming the bounty of war for the marauding \n jihadists \n that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism with greater rigidity than the \n Hindu \n archetype from which the practice was inherited \n Despite the rhetoric of equality scholars have \"found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes\" \n Furthermore despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism denouncing sexism female infanticide dowry sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolationthe reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent like \n Hindus \n Buddhists \n and \n Jains \n Christianity \n Main articles \n Christian egalitarianism \n Christian communism \n and \n Christian universalism \n The \n Christian egalitarian \n view holds that the \n Bible \n teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes all economic classes and all age groups but within the teachings and example of \n Jesus Christ \n God \n and the overarching principles of scripture \n Within the wide range of \n Christianity \n there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups some of which are \n complementarians \n There many that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure for example parents having authority over their children These ideas are considered by some to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism At its foundation \n Galatians \n holds \"There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus\" defining all as equal in the sight of God Similarly \n Colossians \n says \"Here there is no Gentile or Jew circumcised or uncircumcised barbarian \n Scythian \n slave or free but Christ is all and is in all\" defining all as equal in the sight of God in relationship to faith in Jesus Christ Various Christian groups have attempted to hold to this view and develop Christian oriented communities In \n Acts \n chapter members of the early Christian community sell their possessions give the proceeds to a common fund overseen by the disciples then take \"according to their need\" One of the most notable of present-day communities are the \n Hutterite \n groups of Europe and North America living in agricultural and collective communities \n Judaism \n Judaism \n is not a \n universalist \n religion and teaches that \n Jews \n defined as either the biological descendants of \n Jacob \n \"Israel\" the son of Isaac and grandson of \n Abraham \n or someone who converted have a specific covenant with \n God \n as a \n chosen people \n Deutoronomy \n \"chosen as God's \n treasured people \n \" to serve as an example of \n God's light \n to the rest of the world The oral Torah and \n Rabbinic literature \n codified in the \n Talmud \n makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the \n gentiles \n literally \"the nations\" However Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the \n Seven Laws of Noah \n In this aspect Judaism is universalist in its divine message but not in its religious obligations In \n reform \n and \n conservative Judaism \n egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations \n Synagogues \n that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating i e no \n mechitza \n and allow women to lead \n services \n with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the \n Torah \n Islam \n The \n Islamic \n stance on equality is not similar to that of Christianity it doesn't stress that all humans are equal in the eyes of God regardless of gender class and race The \n Quran \n states \"O mankind indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another Indeed the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you Indeed Allah is Knowing and Acquainted\" \n Louise Marlow's \n Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought \n compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice \n Military egalitarianism \n Military egalitarianism has been noted since ancient times such as with Shakespeare's \n St Crispin's Day Speech \n This occurs in spite of the distinctions military forces attempt to make between officers and enlisted men For example former Major General \n Charles J Dunlap Jr \n said that \n United States Air Force \n culture included an egalitarianism bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft \n Modern egalitarianism theory \n Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically politically and socially Modern egalitarianism theory or \"new egalitarianism\" outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other In essence the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talentsthese differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other \n Reception \n The \n cultural theory of risk \n holds egalitarianism as defined by a negative attitude towards rules and principles and a positive attitude towards group decision-making with \n fatalism \n termed as its opposite \n The theory distinguishes between \n hierarchists \n who are positive towards both rules and groups and egalitarianists who are positive towards groups but negative towards rules \n This is by definition a form of \"anarchist equality\" as referred to by \n Berkman \n The fabric of an \"egalitarianist society\" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit \n peer pressure \n rather than by explicit rules and punishment However Thompson et al theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective be it egalitarianist hierarchist \n individualist \n fatalist \n or \n autonomist \n will be inherently unstable the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling For instance although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles \n Accordingly egalitarianists have no power except through their presence unless they by definition reluctantly embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group autonomists or individualists \n Alexander Berkman \n suggests that \"equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp True anarchist equality implies freedom not quantity It does not mean that every one must eat drink or wear the same things do the same work or live in the same manner Far from it the very reverse in fact Individual needs and tastes differ as appetites differ It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality Far from levelling such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development For human character is diverse\" \n Marxism \n Karl Marx \n and \n Friedrich Engels \n believed that a revolution would bring about a \n socialist \n society which would then eventually give way to a \n communist \n stage of social development which would be a classless stateless humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability to each according to his needs\" \n However \n Marxism \n rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest such as a universal notion of \"equality\" but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desiresthus Marx's notion of \n communist society \n is radically individualistic \n Marx was a proponent of two principles the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society \" \n To each according to his contribution \n \" and \" \n From each according to their ability to each according to their needs \n \" Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic \n \" \n

military officers' \n spurs \n but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \"tradition\" itself derives from

purpose whether that be political or cultural over short periods of time Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways \n One way tradition is used more simply often in academic work but elsewhere also is to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed The phrase \"according to tradition \" or \"by tradition \" usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition but is not supported and perhaps may be refuted by physical documentation by a physical artifact or other quality evidence For example \"According to tradition Homer was born on Chios but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs \" This tradition may never be proven or disproven In another example \" \n King Arthur \n by tradition a true British king has inspired many well loved stories \" Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature \n Aside from this use in describing the quality of information various scholarly fields define the term differently as is needed For example \n anthropology \n and \n biology \n have each defined tradition it more precisely than in conventional as described below in order to facilitate scholarly discourse \n The concept of tradition as the notion of holding on to a previous time is also found in political and philosophical discourse For example it is the basis of the political concept of \n traditionalism \n and also strands of many world religions including \n traditional Catholicism \n In artistic contexts tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form For example in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences A number of factors can exacerbate the \n loss of tradition \n including industrialization \n globalization \n and the assimilation or \n marginalization \n of specific cultural groups In response to this tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world focusing on aspects such as traditional languages Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of \n modernity \n and should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts \n Definition \n Invention of tradition \n In scholarly discourse \n Anthropology \n Archaeology \n Biology \n Musicology and ethnomusicology \n Sociology \n Philosophy \n In political and religious discourse \n In

manuscripts of the \n Sefer Torah \n Torah scroll are passed down providing additional \n vowel points \n pronunciation marks \n and \n stress accents \n in the authentic \n Masoretic Text \n of the \n Jewish Bible \n often the basis for translations of the Christian Old Testament \n The English word \"tradition\" comes from the \n Latin \n traditio \n the noun from the verb \n tradere \n to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping it was originally used in \n Roman law \n to refer to the concept of legal transfers and \n inheritance \n According to \n Anthony Giddens \n and others the modern meaning of tradition can be seen as having evolved in the European discourse in the last two hundred years during the \n Enlightenment \n period as philosophers and thinkers counter posed the concept of modernity with the concept of tradition in the context of \n progress \n As with many other generic terms there are many definitions of tradition \n The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs objects or customs performed or believed in the past originating in it transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next and are performed or believed in the present \n Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are \n Prehistoric \n with lost or \n arcane \n origins existing from \n time immemorial \n Originally traditions were passed orally without the need for a \n writing system \n Tools to aid this process include \n poetic devices \n such as \n rhyme \n and \n alliteration \n The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition or as part of an \n oral tradition \n Even such traditions however are presumed to have originated been \"invented\" by humans at some point \n Traditions are often presumed to be \n ancient \n unalterable and deeply important though they may sometimes be much less \"natural\" than is presumed \n It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three \n generations \n are required for a practice belief or object to be seen as traditional \n Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution \n Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition \n Tradition changes slowly with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant \n Thus those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations it will be seen as unchanged \n There are various origins and fields of tradition they can refer to \n the forms of artistic heritage of a particular culture \n beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments such as \n national anthems \n and \n national holidays \n such as \n Federal holidays in the United States \n beliefs or customs maintained by \n religious denominations \n and \n church bodies \n that share history customs culture and to some extent body of teachings \n For example one can speak of Islam's tradition or Christianity's tradition \n Many objects beliefs and customs can be traditional \n Rituals of \n social interaction \n can be traditional with phrases and gestures such as saying \"thank you\" sending \n birth announcements \n greeting cards \n etc \n Tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups family traditions at Christmas \n organizations company's \n picnic \n or societies such as the practice of national and public holidays \n Some of the oldest traditions include \n monotheism \n three millennia and \n citizenship \n two millennia \n It can also include material objects such as buildings works of art or tools \n Tradition is often used as an \n adjective \n in contexts such as \n traditional music \n traditional medicine \n traditional values \n and others \n In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context passed through generations \n Invention of tradition \n Invented tradition \n The term \" \n invention of tradition \n \" introduced by \n E J Hobsbawm \n refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present \n A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal commercial political or \n national self-interest \n as was done in colonial Africa or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event rather than developing and spreading organically in a population as in the case of the white \n wedding dress \n which only became popular after \n Queen Victoria \n wore a white gown at her wedding to \n Albert of Saxe-Coburg \n An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the \n Palace of Westminster \n location of the \n British Parliament \n in the \n Gothic style \n Similarly most of the traditions associated with \n monarchy of the United Kingdom \n seen as rooted deep in history actually date to 19th century \n Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces \n Requiring \n legitimacy \n the \n colonial power \n would often invent a \"tradition\" which they could use to legitimize their own position For example a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition but were exaggerated distorted or biased toward a particular interpretation \n Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by \n nationalism \n Common examples include public holidays particularly those unique to a particular nation the singing of national anthems and traditional national cuisine see \n national dish \n Expatriate \n and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation \n In scholarly discourse \n In science tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field \n In philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a \"rational theory of tradition\" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological For Popper each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it \n Unlike \n myth \n which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates who proposed critical discussion according to Popper \n For \n Thomas Kuhn \n who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is historically what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embrasure of tradition \n Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in \n social sciences \n chiefly anthropology \n archeology \n and biologywith somewhat different meanings in different fields It is also used in varying contexts in other fields such as history \n psychology \n and \n sociology \n Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis In the 1970s and 1980s \n Edward Shils \n explored the concept in detail \n Since then a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition meanwhile \"tradition\" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals \n Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions perspectives approaches in those disciplines \n Anthropology \n Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology it can be said that anthropology is the study of \"tradition in traditional societies\" \n There is however no \"theory of tradition\" as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary as defining tradition is both unnecessary everyone can be expected to know what it is and unimportant as small differences in definition would be just technical \n There are however dissenting views scholars such as \n Pascal Boyer \n argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline \n Archaeology \n In \n archaeology \n the term \n tradition \n is a set of \n cultures \n or \n industries \n which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time The term is especially common in the study of \n American archaeology \n Biology \n Biologists when examining groups of non-humans have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next Tradition is defined in biology as \"a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring i e is performed repeatedly over a period of time that is shared among two or more members of a group that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners\" and has been called a precursor to \"culture\" in the anthropological sense \n Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish birds and mammals Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees in particular may display large numbers of behavioral traditions and in chimpanzees transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another not just within a group has been observed Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change \n Musicology and ethnomusicology \n Amar Rabbi Elazar \n A traditional setting of the last passage of the first tractate \n Berakhot \n of the \n Oral Torah \n which describes how scholars of the Talmud create peace in the world Performed by \n Cantor \n Meyer Kanewsky in for \n Edison Records \n Problems playing this file? See \n media help \n In the field of \n musicology \n and \n ethnomusicology \n tradition refers to the belief systems repertoire techniques style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns Along with a sense of history traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music' \n they differ in their methodology and subject of research 'Tradition or traditions can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective ' \n Sociology \n The concept of tradition in early sociological research around the turn of the 19th and 20th century referred to that of the \n traditional society \n as contrasted by the more modern \n industrial society \n This approach was most notably portrayed in \n Max Weber \n 's concepts of \n traditional authority \n and modern \n rational-legal authority \n In more modern works One hundred years later sociology sees tradition as a \n social construct \n used to contrast past with the present and as a form of \n rationality \n used to justify certain course of action \n Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business \n division of labor \n influenced primarily by age gender and status high position of custom in the system of values self-sufficiency preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment relative \n autarky \n Early theories positing the simple \n unilineal evolution \n of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic \n In Edward Shils in his book \n Tradition \n put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted \n According to Shils tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present \n Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality It is also related to the works of Max Weber see \n theories of rationality \n and were popularized and redefined in by \n Raymond Boudon \n in his book \n Action \n In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as \"it has always been that way\" \n This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the \n appeal to tradition \n or \n argumentum ad antiquitatem \n which takes the form \"this is right because we've always done it this way \" \n In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the \"tradition\" being advocated may no longer be desirable or indeed may never have been despite its previous popularity \n Philosophy \n The idea of tradition is important in philosophy Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries and a 'continental' tradition dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents following \n Martin Heidegger \n call 'the tradition' which began with \n Plato \n and \n Aristotle \n In contrast some continental philosophers - most notably \n Hans-Georg Gadamer \n - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of \n Aristotelianism \n This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by \n Alasdair MacIntyre \n However MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition' instead posing \n Aristotelianism \n as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others \n In political and religious discourse \n Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal decor with \n Christmas tree \n a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century \n Main articles \n Traditional values \n and \n Traditionalist conservatism \n The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values \n Similarly strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition For example the term \" \n traditionalist Catholic \n \" refers to those such as \n Archbishop Lefebvre \n who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the \n Second Vatican Council \n of \n Likewise \n Sunni Muslims \n are referred to as \n Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamah \n Arabic \n literally \"people of the tradition of \n Muhammad \n and the community\" emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition \n More generally tradition has been used as a way of determining the \n political spectrum \n with \n right-wing \n parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than \n left-wing \n ones \n citation needed \n Here the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism or simply \n traditionalism \n which emphasizes the need for the principles of \n natural law \n and transcendent moral order \n hierarchy \n and \n organic unity \n agrarianism \n classicism \n and \n high culture \n and the intersecting spheres of loyalty \n Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of \n individualism \n liberalism modernity and \n social progress \n but promote cultural and educational renewal \n and revive interest in the church the family the state and local community This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable for example stereotypical views of the \n place of women in domestic affairs \n In other societies especially ones experiencing rapid social change the idea of what is \"traditional\" may be widely contested with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society in other cases tradition is a means of \n othering \n and keeping groups distinct from one another \n In artistic discourse \n In artistic contexts in the performance of traditional genres such as \n traditional dance \n adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences \n It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional \n For artistic endeavors tradition has been used as a contrast to \n creativity \n with traditional and \n folk art \n associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition in contrast to \n fine art \n which is valued for being original and unique More recent philosophy of art however considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression \n Relationship to other concepts \n In the social sciences \n tradition \n is often contrasted with \n modernity \n particularly in terms of whole societies This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern \n Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing \n filial piety \n harmony and group welfare stability and \n interdependence \n while a society exhibiting modernity would value \"individualism with free will and choice mobility and progress \" \n Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity Anthony Giddens sees tradition as something bound to ritual where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition \n Gusfield and others though criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified arguing that tradition is dynamic heterogeneous and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals \n Tradition should be differentiated from \n customs \n conventions \n laws \n norms \n routines rules \n and similar concepts Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change \n Whereas justification for tradition is \n ideological \n the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical \n Over time customs routines conventions rules and such can evolve into traditions but that usually requires that they stop having primarily a practical purpose \n For example wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable \n spurs \n worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional \n Preservation \n Woman welcoming the \n Shabbat \n a more than years old tradition \n In many countries concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization \n globalization \n and the \n assimilation \n or \n marginalization \n of specific cultural groups \n Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved \n Likewise the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as \n Cornish \n under the auspices of the \n European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages \n Specifically the charter holds that these languages \"contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions\" The Charter goes on to call for \"the use or adoption of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages\" \n Similarly \n UNESCO \n includes both \"oral tradition\" and \"traditional manifestations\" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage It therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil \n In \n Japan \n certain artworks structures craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties \n This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as \" \n National Living Treasures \n \" and encourages the preservation of their craft \n For native peoples like the \n Mori \n in New Zealand there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition \n Traditional cultural expressions \n The phrase \"traditional cultural expressions\" is used by the \n World Intellectual Property Organization \n to refer to \"any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied They are transmitted from one generation to the next and include handmade textiles paintings stories legends ceremonies music songs rhythms and dance \" \n Aition \n Folklore \n Look up \n tradition \n in Wiktionary the free dictionary \n Perennial philosophy"},

with regards to environmental protection \n Voluntary environmental agreements \n In industrial countries voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of best environmental practice For instance in India Environment Improvement Trust EIT has been working for environment & forest protection since A group of Green Volunteers get a goal of Green India Clean India concept CA Gajendra Kumar Jain a Chartered Accountant is the founder of Environment Improvement Trust in Sojat city a small village of State of Rajasthan in India \n In developing countries such as throughout Latin America these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation \n The challenges that exist with these agreements lie in establishing baseline data targets monitoring and reporting Due to the difficulties inherent in evaluating effectiveness their use is often questioned and indeed the whole environment may well be adversely affected as a result The key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity \n Ecosystems approach \n An \n ecosystems \n approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges Ideally the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments as well as representatives of industry environmental groups and community This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation Religions also play an important role in conservation of environment Ref-Hadiya Habib Role of religious education and different religions in conservation and maintenance of environment www oiirj org vol July special issue \n International environmental agreements \n Kyoto Protocol Commitment map \n Many of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across many countries As a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate oceans rivers and air pollution These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and at other times are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as in Europe America and Africa \n Some of the most well-known international agreements include the Kyoto Protocol and others \n Government \n Kyoto Protocol \n Discussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government legislation and law enforcement However in its broadest sense environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry indigenous groups environmental group and community representatives Gradually environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries \n Many constitutions acknowledge the fundamental right to environmental protection and many international treaties acknowledge the right to live in a healthy environment \n Also many countries have organizations and agencies devoted to environmental protection There are international environmental protection organizations such as the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n Although environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of government agencies most people view these agencies as being of prime importance in establishing and maintaining basic standards that protect both the environment and the people interacting with it \n Tanzania \n Tanzania \n is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas including several national parks \n The concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth expansion of subsistence agriculture pollution timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel \n Zebras at the Serengeti savana plains in Tanzania \n 1gbpx|frame|center|environment \n History of environmental protection \n Environmental protection in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa 1884-1919 colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting firewood collecting and cattle grazing \n In year Serengeti was officially established as the first national park for wild cats in East Africa Since there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council NEMC and the development of an environmental act In Environment Improvement Trust EIT start working for environment & forest protection in India from a small city Sojat Founder of Environment Improvement Trust is CA Gajendra Kumar Jain working with volunteers \n Government protection \n Division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection It does this through the formulation of policy coordinating and monitoring environmental issues environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research The National Environment Management Council NEMC is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues The NEMC the following purposes provide technical advice coordinate technical activities develop enforcement guidelines and procedures assess monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment promote and assist environmental information and communication and seek advancement of scientific knowledge \n The National Environment Policy of acts as a framework for environmental decision making in Tanzania The policy objectives are to achieve the following \n Ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources without degrading the environment or risking health or safety \n Prevent and control degradation of land water vegetation and air \n Conserve and enhance natural and man-made heritage including biological diversity of unique ecosystems \n Improve condition and productivity of degraded areas \n Raise awareness and understanding of the link between environment and development \n Promote individual and community participation \n Promote international cooperation \n Tanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment and the Convention on Biological Diversity The Environmental Management Act is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions The policy tools that are parts of the act includes the use of environmental-impact assessments strategics environmentals assessments and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products The effectiveness of shifing of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that historically there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice \n China \n The \n Longwanqun National Forest Park \n is a nationally protected nature area in Huinan County Jilin China \n Formal environmental protection in China House was first stimulated by the \n United Nations Conference on the Human Environment \n held in Stockholm Sweden Following this they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy In the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China's basic national policies and in the National Environmental Protection Agency NEPA was established Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency SEPA meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented

China's GDP This grew to 3% by and the economic loss from water pollution 1% began to exceed that caused by air pollution \n China has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth 64% in the past ten years \n However the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries In China was ranked 121st out of countries on the \n Environmental Performance Index \n China has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation \n China's

development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high GDP For China to develop sustainably environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies \n Quote from Shengxian Zhou head of MEP \"Good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure production form and develop

Mexico \n The history of environmental policy in Mexico started in the 1940s with the enactment of the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water in Spanish Ley de Conservacin de Suelo y Agua Three decades later at the beginning of the 1970s the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminacin Ambiental \n In year was the first direct response

{"theme.id": 7, "title": "Altruism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism", "depth": 0, "text": "Altruism \n For the concept in behavioral ecology see \n Altruism biology \n Giving \n alms \n to the poor is often considered an altruistic action \n Altruism \n or \n selflessness \n is the principle or practice of concern for the \n welfare \n of others It is a traditional \n virtue \n in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of \"others\" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of \n selfishness \n The word was coined by the French philosopher \n Auguste Comte \n in French as \n altruisme \n for an \n antonym \n of \n egoism \n He derived it from the Italian \n altrui \n which in turn was derived from Latin \n alteri \n meaning \" \n other people \n \" or \"somebody else\" \n Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves e g pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another third-party individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is \"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards\" \n Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of \n loyalty \n in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships Much debate exists as to whether \n \"true\" \n altruism is possible in human psychology The theory of \n psychological egoism \n suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal \n gratification \n The validity of this argument depends on whether \n intrinsic rewards \n qualify as \"benefits\" The actor also may not be expecting a reward \n The term \n altruism \n may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others Used in this sense it is usually contrasted with \n egoism \n which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self \n The notion of altruism \n Scientific viewpoints \n Anthropology \n Evolutionary explanations \n Neurobiology \n Psychology \n Sociology \n Pathological altruism \n Religious viewpoints \n Buddhism \n Jainism \n Christianity \n Islam \n Judaism \n Sikhism \n Hinduism \n Philosophy \n Genetics \n Notes \n The notion of altruism \n The concept has a long history in \n philosophical \n and \n ethical \n thought The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding \n sociologist \n and \n philosopher of science \n Auguste Comte \n and has become a major topic for \n psychologists \n especially \n evolutionary psychology \n researchers \n evolutionary biologists \n and \n ethologists \n Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism In simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them \n Scientific viewpoints \n Anthropology \n Marcel Mauss \n 's book \n The Gift \n contains a passage called \"Note on alms\" This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice In it he writes \n Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other Generosity is an obligation because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it This is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children \n Compare \n Altruism ethics perception of altruism as self-sacrifice \n Compare \n explanation of alms in various scriptures \n Evolutionary explanations \n Main articles \n Altruism in animals \n Evolution of morality \n and \n Evolutionary ethics \n Giving alms to beggar children \n In the science of \n ethology \n the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of \n social evolution \n altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the \n fitness \n of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor \n In \n evolutionary psychology \n this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners \n tipping \n courtship gifts production of \n public goods \n and \n environmentalism \n Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from \n evolutionary game theory \n a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies \n Some of the proposed mechanisms are \n Kin selection \n That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior One kinship cue is facial resemblance One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons Another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helpful behavior Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study This effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families \n Vested interests People are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social \n ingroups \n suffer or even disappear Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile \n outgroup \n threatens to kill the entire ingroup \n Reciprocal altruism \n Reciprocity evolution \n Direct \n reciprocity \n Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help The effective \n tit for tat \n strategy is one \n game theoretic \n example Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return \n One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a \"Community Game\" instead of a \"Wall Street Game \" \n A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped On the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts As such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation \n People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population Thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group \n Indirect reciprocity \n The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's \n reputation \n to become very important A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously \n Strong reciprocity \n A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence \n Pseudo-reciprocity \n An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist \n Costly signaling \n and the \n handicap principle \n Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an \"honest signal\" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics \n Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else Similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability \n Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the \n Houston Astrodome \n following Hurricane Katrina \n Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else This have been documented in many studies The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects \n Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns \n Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners When looking for a long-term partner altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success \n People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause \n competitive altruism \n On the other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous This may possibly be due to reasons such as \n psychopathy \n or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative \n Explicit \n extrinsic \n rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards This may be because such extrinsic top-down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non-cooperators A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all \n Group selection \n It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as \n David Sloan Wilson \n that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level Thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members See also \n in-group favoritism \n Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists \n Helping the \n homeless \n in New York City \n Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their \n inclusive fitness \n when they are doing altruistic acts Instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors \n Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits \n The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non-competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup \n The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind \n George R Price \n 's development of the \n Price equation \n which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular \n slime moulds \n such as \n Dictyostelium \n mucoroides \n These protists live as individual \n amoebae \n until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body \n Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long-term high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success \n Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist \n Peter Kropotkin \n in his book \n Mutual Aid A Factor of Evolution \n and \n Peter Singer \n in his book \n A Darwinian Left \n Neurobiology \n Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman neuroscientists at the \n National Institutes of Health \n and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network J M provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using \n functional magnetic resonance imaging \n In their research published in the \n Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \n USA in October \n they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the \n mesolimbic \n reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex However when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex/ \n septal region \n These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species Altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard-wired and pleasurable \n One brain region the subgenual \n anterior cingulate \n cortex/ \n basal forebrain \n contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with trait empathy \n The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding \n In fact in an experiment published in March at the \n University of Southern California \n neuroscientist \n Antonio R Damasio \n and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the \n ventromedial prefrontal cortex \n lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that When confronted with moral dilemmas these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with \"end-justifies-the-means\" answers leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains According to \n Adrian Raine \n a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse Without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?\" \n In another study in the 1990s Dr Bill Harbaugh a \n University of Oregon \n economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in with his psychologist colleague Dr Ulrich Mayr reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups \"egoists\" and \"altruists\" One of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered \"egoists\" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as a person's environment and values \n Psychology \n The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines \n psychological altruism \n as \"a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare \" Psychological altruism is contrasted with \n psychological egoism \n which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare \n There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism \n Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors \n However because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question The \n social exchange theory \n postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self \n Daniel Batson \n is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory He identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle \n principlism \n Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless \n The \n empathy-altruism \n hypothesis \n basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering \n Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues \n Peace Corps \n trainees swearing in as volunteers in \n Cambodia \n April \n In psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service \n Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the \n Bystander effect \n Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility \n However a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders \n A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving \n Many studies have observed the effects of \n volunteerism \n as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being \n In a study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in \n depression \n anxiety \n and \n somatization \n Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages \n One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one \n A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying After controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality \n Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness \n It is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite directionthat happier people are also kinder The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states \n Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness \n For example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant \n Additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that \"a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well-being \" \n Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as \"the helper's high\" \n Sociology \n \"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society\" \"Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity\" American Sociological Association \n The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro-social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field The American Sociology Association ASA acknowledges \n Public sociology \n saying \"The intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable\" \"Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity\" ASA This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies How altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and \"build the good society\" \n Public sociology \n Pathological altruism \n Pathological \n altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good \n The term \"pathological altruism\" was popularised by the book \n Pathological Altruism \n Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid \n Religious viewpoints \n Evolutionary origin of religions \n Most if not all of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value \n Buddhism \n Christianity \n Hinduism \n Islam \n Jainism \n Judaism \n and \n Sikhism \n etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality \n Buddhism \n Monks collecting alms \n Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering \"Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being\" Dalai Lama \n Still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness \"The more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well-being becomes\" Dalai Lama \n In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness \n Jainism \n Ahimsa in Jainism \n Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of \n ahimsa \n non-injury \n The fundamental principles of \n Jainism \n revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings Jainism preaches the view of \n Ahimsa \n to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i e uncompromising reverence for all life It also considers all living things to be equal The first \n Tirthankara \n Rishabhdev \n introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non-violence and compassion for all living things \n Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors One's unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans Anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment \n Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks They are \n Non-violence Ahimsa \n Truthfulness Satya \n Non-stealing Asteya \n Celibacy Brahmacharya \n Non-possession \n or non-materialism Aparigraha \n The \"great vows\" \n Mahavrata \n are prescribed for monks and \"limited vows\" \n Anuvrata \n are prescribed for householders The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows The monks have to observe them very strictly With consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress \n The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul Jainism views every \n soul \n as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become \n Siddha \n God in Jainism \n Because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one's actions Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small This policy extends even to microscopic organisms Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders \n Christianity \n Statue of \n Mother Teresa \n in India \n Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the \n Gospel \n especially in the \n Sermon on the Mount \n and the \n Sermon on the Plain \n From biblical to medieval \n Christian traditions \n tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of \"disinterested love\" as in the \n Pauline \n phrase \"love seeks not its own interests \" In his book \n Indoctrination and Self-deception \n Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many Love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person's experience and practice from within As in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection \n St Thomas Aquinas \n interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' \n as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others \n Considering that \"the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship\" and quotes Aristotle that \"the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves \" \n he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part However he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily lifesince the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being In coining the word Altruism as stated above \n Comte \n was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism \n Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God John states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God \n Thomas Jay Oord \n has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love An altruistic action is not always a loving action Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being \n German philosopher \n Max Scheler \n distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak One way is a sincere expression of Christian love \"motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence\" \n Another way is merely \"one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business \" \n At its worst Scheler says \"love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse \" \n Islam \n In \n Islam \n the concept 'eysaar' altruism is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself' For Sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body considered to be property of ALLAH alone The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good \n Islam \n considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility \n This is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that European concept in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence A constant concern for \n ALLAH \n i e God results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world \n This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like \n Rabia al-Adawiyya \n who paid attention to the difference between dedication to \n ALLAH \n i e God and dedication to people Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet \n Yunus Emre \n explained this philosophy as \"Yaratlan severiz Yaratandan tr\" or \n We love the creature because of The Creator \n For many Muslims i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays However i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times \n Judaism \n Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation The famous Rabbi \n Abraham Isaac Kook \n stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity \n This is defined as \n bestowal \n or giving which is the intention of altruism This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God \n Kabbalah \n defines God as the force of giving in \n existence \n Rabbi \n Moshe Chaim Luzzatto \n in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force \n Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi \n Yehuda Ashlag \n in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework \n Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another Ashlag focused on society and its relation to \n divinity \n Sikhism

imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness The fifth Nanak Guru Arjun Dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the Guru Granth The ninth Guru Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity In the late seventeenth century \n Guru Gobind Singh \n Ji the tenth \n guru \n in Sikhism was in war with the \n Mughal \n rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh \n Bhai Kanhaiya \n attended the troops of the enemy He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield \"What were you doing and why?\" asked the Guru \"I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them \" replied Bhai Kanhaiya The Guru responded \"Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru \" \n It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same \n Hinduism \n Swami Sivananda \n an \n Advaita \n scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the \n Brahma Sutras \n a Vedantic text In his commentary on Chapter of the Brahma Sutras Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed Hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit Furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates \n apurva \n or \n punya \n which gives fruit Since apurva is non-sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment \n However the very well known and popular text the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga selfless action or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality \n Philosophy \n Altruism ethics \n There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically Proponents of \n ethical altruism \n maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically The opposing view is \n ethical egoism \n which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with \n utilitarianism \n which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants \n A related concept in \n descriptive ethics \n is \n psychological egoism \n the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible \n Rational egoism \n is the view that \n rationality \n consists in acting in one's self-interest without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations \n Genetics \n The genes \n OXTR \n CD38 \n COMT \n DRD4 \n DRD5 \n IGF2 \n GABRB2 \n have been found to be candidate genes for altruism \n Altruria

asserted that all nations follow a cycle of democracy oligarchy dictatorship tyranny and collapse \n Islamic scholar \n Ibn Khaldun \n also produced a general theory of state collapse A \"theological

agreed on its causes \n No one predicted the \n Arab spring \n Though many writings study particular cases of state collapse in isolation \n there appears to be no contemporary text which compares events on a global historical basis and identifies common features \n Martin Wight \n like Saunders deplored the \"demonic concentrations of power\" of the defeated countries in the two world wars A

Author \n Crane Brinton \n Language \n English \n Subject \n Political science \n Publisher \n Vintage \n Publication date \n revised August \n Pages \n ISBN \n 0-394-70044-9 \n OCLC \n The Anatomy of Revolution \n is a book by \n Crane Brinton \n outlining the \"uniformities\" of four major political revolutions the \n English Revolution \n of the 1640s the \n American \n the \n French \n and the \n Russian Revolution \n Brinton notes how the revolutions followed a life-cycle from the Old Order to a moderate regime to a radical regime to \n Thermidorian reaction \n The book has been called \"classic \n \"famous\" and a \"watershed in the study of revolution\" \n and has been influential enough to have inspired advice given to US President \n Jimmy Carter \n by his National Security Advisor \n Zbigniew Brzezinski \n during the \n Iranian Revolution \n Revised editions of Brinton's book were published in and and it remains in print \n Brinton summarizes the revolutionary process as moving from \"financial breakdown to organization of the discontented to remedy this breakdown revolutionary demands on the part of these organized discontented demands which if granted would mean the virtual abdication of those governing attempted use of force by the government its failure and the attainment of power by the revolutionists These revolutionists have hitherto been acting as an organized and nearly unanimous group but with the attainment of power it is clear that they are not united The group which dominates these first stages we call the moderates power passes by violent methods from \n Right \n to \n Left \n \" p \n Themes \n Fall of the old regime \n Background of the revolutionaries \n Revolutionary regimes \n Moderates and dual power \n Radicals and \"Reigns of Terror and Virtue\" \n \"Thermidor\" \n Lasting results \n Comparisons \n Limitations of the theory \n Themes \n According to Brinton while \"we must not expect our revolutions to be identical\" p three of the four the English French and Russian began \"in hope and moderation\" reached \"a crisis in a \n reign of terror \n \" and ended \"in something like \n dictatorship \n Cromwell \n Bonaparte \n Stalin \n \" The exception is the American Revolution which \"does not quite follow this pattern\" p \n Fall of the old regime \n The revolutions begin with problems in the pre-revolutionary regime These include problems functioning\"government deficits more than usual complaints over taxation conspicuous governmental favoring of one set of economic interests over another administrative entanglements and confusions\" There are also social problems such as the feeling by some that careers are not \"open to talents\" and economic power is separated from political power and social distinction There is a \"loss of self-confidence among many members of the ruling class\" the \"conversion of many members of that class to the belief that their privileges are unjust or harmful to society\" p \"Intellectuals\" switch their allegiance away from the government p In short \"the ruling class becomes politically inept\" p \n Financial problems play an important role as \"three of our four revolutions started among people who objected to certain taxes who organized to protest them even in Russia in the financial problems were real and important\" p \n The revolutions' enemies and supporters disagree over whether plots and manipulation by revolutionists or the corruption and tyranny of the old regime are responsible for the old regime's fall Brinton argues both are right as both the right circumstances and active agitation are necessary for the revolution to succeed p \n At some point in the first stages of the revolutions \"there is a point where constituted authority is challenged by illegal acts of revolutionists\" and the response of security forces is strikingly unsuccessful In France in the \"king didn't really try\" to subdue riots effectively In England the king \"didn't have enough good soldiers\" In Russia \"at the critical moment the soldiers refused to march against the people\" and instead joined them p \n Background of the revolutionaries \n Revolutions \"are born of hope\" rather than misery p Contrary to the belief that revolutionaries are disproportionately \n poor \n or down-and-out \"revolutionists are more or less a cross section of common humanity\" While revolutionaries \"behave in a way we should not expect such people to behave\" this can be explained by the \"revolutionary environment\" rather than their background p \"' \n Untouchables \n ' very rarely revolt\" and successful slave revolutions like \n Haiti \n 's are few in number p Revolutionaries are \"not unprosperous\" but \"feel restraint cramp rather than downright crushing oppression\" p \n Revolutionary regimes \n In each revolution a short \"honeymoon\" period follows the fall of the old regime lasting until the \"contradictory elements\" among the victorious revolutionaries assert themselves p Power then has a tendency \"to go from Right to Center to Left\" p In the process Brinton says 'the revolution like \n Saturn \n devours its children' quoting \n Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud \n p \n Moderates and dual power \n The revolutions being studied first produce a \"legal\" moderate government It vies with a more radical \"illegal\" government in a process known as \" \n dual power \n \" or as Brinton prefers to call it \"dual sovereignty\" In England the \"Presbyterian moderates in Parliament\" were rivals of \"the illegal government of the extremist Independents in the New Model Army\" p In France the National Assembly was controlled by the \" \n Girondin \n moderates\" while the \n Montagnard \n \"extremists\" controlled \"the Jacobin network\" \"the Paris commune\" p and the Societies of the Friends of the Constitution p In Russia the moderate provisional government of the Duma clashed with the radical Bolsheviks whose illegal government was a \"network of soviets\" p \n The \n radicals \n triumph because \n they are \"better organized better staffed better obeyed\" p \n they have \"relatively few responsibilities while the legal government \"has to shoulder some of the unpopularity of the government of the old regime\" with \"the worn-out machinery the institutions of the old regime\" p \n the moderates are hindered by their hesitancy to change direction and fight back against the radical revolutionaries \"with whom they recently stood united\" in favor of conservatives \"against whom they have so recently risen\" p They are drawn to the slogan 'no enemies to the Left' p \n the moderates are attacked on one side by \"disgruntled but not yet silenced conservatives and the confident aggressive extremists\" on the other The moderate revolutionary policies can please neither side An example is the \n Root and Branch \n Bill in the English Revolution which abolished the episcopacy angering conservatives and established institutions without earning the loyalty of radicals p 141-43 \n they are the \"poor\" leaders of the wars which accompany the revolutions unable to \"provide the discipline the enthusiasm\" needed p \n Radicals and \"Reigns of Terror and Virtue\" \n In contrast to the moderates the radicals are aided by a fanatical devotion to their cause discipline and in recent revolutions a study of technique of revolutionary action obedience to their leadership ability to ignore contradictions between their rhetoric and action and drive boldly ahead p Even their small numbers are an advantage giving them \"the ability to move swiftly to make clear and final decisions to push through to a goal without regard for injured human dispositions\" p \n The radicals took power in Russia with the \n October Revolution \n in France with the purge of the \n Girondins \n in England \" \n Pride's Purge \n \" p The American Revolution never had a radical dictatorship and Reign of Terror \"though in the treatment of Loyalist in the pressure to support the army in some of the phases of social life you can discern many of the phenomena of the Terror as it is seen in our three other societies\" p \n The radical reign is one of \"Terror and Virtue\" Terror stemming from the abundance of summary executions foreign and civil war struggle for power \n virtue \n in the form of \n puritanical \n \"organized asceticism\" and suppression of vices such as drunkenness gambling and prostitution p In its ardor revolutionary \"tragicomedy\" touches the average citizen for whom \"politics becomes as real as pressing as unavoidable as food and drink\" their \"job and the weather\" p \n On taking power the radicals rule through dictatorship and \"rough-and-ready centralization\" \"The characteristic form of this supreme authority is that of a committee\" p The \n Council of State \n in England \n Committee of Public Safety \n in France \n At some point in these revolutions the \"process of transfer of power from Right to Left ceases\" and groups even more radical than those in power are suppressed p In France the \n Hbertists \n are sent to the guillotine p in Russia the \n Kronstadt rebellion \n is crushed \n At least in France and Russia the accession of radicals is also accompanied by a decline in political participation measured in votes cast as \"ordinary peaceful\" \"humdrum men and women\" favoring moderation find no outlet for their political beliefs p \n Along with centralization lethal force in suppression of opposition rule by committee radical policies include the spreading of \"the gospel of their revolution\" to other countries This is found not only in the Russian and French revolutions but even seventeenth century England where \n Edward Sexby \n \"proposed to the French radicals\" in \n Bordeaux \n \"a republican constitution which was to be called 'L'Accord du Peuple'an adaptation of the English Agreement of the People\" p These attempts seldom make a significant impact as the revolutionaries \"are usually too poor and too occupied at home\" p \n \"Thermidor\" \n The radical reign of terror or \"crisis\" period is fairly soon replaced by \n Thermidor \n period a period of relaxation from revolutionary policies or \"convalescence\" from the \"fever\" of radicalism Thermidor is named for the period following the fall of \n Maximilien Robespierre \n in the French Revolution in Russia the \n New Economic Policy \n of \"can be called Russia's Thermidor\" p and \"perhaps the best date\" for that period in England is \"Cromwell's \n dissolution of the Rump \n \" p \n The Thermidor is characterized by \n the \"establishment of a 'tyrant'\" i e \"an unconstitutional ruler brought to power by revolution\" p The \"'silken threads' of habit tradition legality\" having been broken \"men must be held together in society by the 'iron chains' of dictatorship\" p \n restoration of many pre-revolutionary ways In Russia this meant an abandonment of the \n Bolshevik \n 's avant-garde stance against the institution of the familyformerly disparaged as \"a stuffy little nest breeding selfishness jealousy love of property indifference toward the great needs of society\" p The Bolshevik regime restored roadblocks to divorce p laws against homosexuality p and moderated its anti-religious \n anti-Eastern Orthodox \n Church stance \n reaction against Puritanism of the revolution In England the \n Restoration comedy \n that appeared after the revolution is now \"a symbol of naughtiness\" p In France the post-revolutionary \n Directory \n era was known as boom time for reopened dance halls and swaggering \n jeunesse doree \n p During the New Economic Policy in Soviet Russia advertising began to appear p as did a new class of entrepreneurs known as the \n Nepmen \n who were reputed to be 'exceptionally vulgar profiteering crude and noisy' p \n the replacement of \"missionary spirit\" to spread revolution by an \"aggressive nationalism\" p In England Cromwell reconquered Ireland and seized \n Jamaica \n In France \n Napoleon \n created an empire p \n America did not have a proper Reign of Terror and Virtue but \"the decade of the 1780s displays in incomplete forms some of the marks of Thermidor\" as evidenced by the complaint of historian J F Jameson \n that 'sober Americans of lamented the spirit of speculation which war and its attendant disturbances had generated the restlessness of the young disrespect for tradition and authority increase of crime the frivolity and extravagance of society' p 235-6 \n Lasting results \n Brinton finds the lasting results of the revolutions disappointing In France the revolution did away with \"the old overlapping jurisdictions the confusions and the compromises inherited from the thousand-year struggle\" between Crown and feudal nobility Weights and measure \"that varied from region to region indeed from town to town\" were replaced with the metric system Also gone was non-decimal coinage unsuited \"for long division\" p Some antiquated practices were also eliminated in England p In Russia the Bolsheviks brought industrialization and eventually the \n Sputnik \n space satellite p Confiscated lands stayed in the hands of the new owners for the most part redistributing land to many \"small independent peasants\" in France p and \n Puritan \n businessmen and clergymen in England p \n Remaining essentially \"untouched\" were day-to-day social relations between husband and wife and children Attempts at establishing new religions and personal habits come to naught The revolutions' \"results look rather petty as measured by the brotherhood of man and the achievement of justice on this earth The blood of the martyrs seems hardly necessary to establish decimal coinage\" p \n Comparisons \n Brinton concludes that despite their ambitions the political revolutions he studied brought much less lasting social changes than the disruptions and changes of \"what is loosely called the \n Industrial Revolution \n \" and the top-down reforms of Mustapha Kemal's \n reforms \n in \n Turkey \n and the \n Meiji Restoration \n or post- \n World War II \n MacArthur era \n in Japan p \n Limitations of the theory \n Brinton admits that 'revolution is one of the looser words' \n Must a revolution always be violent? can it occur by consent as in the UK general election of 1945?

\n Media of the United States \n Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy but if not truly free paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views thus undermining democracy itself \n The First Amendment to the U S Constitution which provides that \"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press \" has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States A limited number of controls such as regulatory laws court decisions and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm \n Major mass media conglomerates in the United States \n Walt Disney Company \n News Corporation \n Time Warner \n CBS Corporation \n Viacom \n General Electric \n These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives media has never been more consolidated \n Power of media versus reality \n The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality symbolic reality and socially constructed reality Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them The media is a \n hegemonic \n form of power that maintains their position not through force but through elaboration of a particular world view an ideology or a particular notion of common sense which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest \n The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society \n Socially constructed reality \n Social construct \n examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world It assumes that understanding significance and meaning are developed not separately within the individual but in coordination among other human beings To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society had different needs values or interests an individual might have built a different kind of thing or built this social construct differently \n It is important to be aware that the values we hold the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions our experiences our education and what we know for a fact Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of We trust the media as an authority for news information education and entertainment Considering that powerful influence then we should know how it really works The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers magazines radio or television Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed Sound recordings and film were and still are influential Radio and then television were very influential As the 20th century closed TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing suffering and relief sexuality and violence celebrity entertainment and much more New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs popular culture websites and various social media outlets \n Experienced reality \n Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition It underlies all of our cognitive efforts Because direct experience is largely sensory automatic and constant we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture \n Events or experiences spark change in an individual Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe and experienced reality is what initiates this idea Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced \n Symbolic reality \n Symbols exist everywhere for an individual Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external between inner and external reality of human being as a person The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome \n personal boundaries \n including power struggles Symbolic reality exists in and through person \n Symbols are objects characters or other representations of ideas concepts or abstractions they are the universal language in a culture Symbols have been used for thousands of years they help individuals communicate and interact with one another Thus as a representation their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic The cultures members must interpret and over time reinterpret Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms such as verbal or nonverbal written or unwritten words on the page drawings pictures gesture They are things which act as triggers to remind people in the culture of its rules beliefs Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as but more subtly than conventional language \n Due to the level of power media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years"},

function of time in human interaction \n Chronemics can be briefly and generally defined as the study of human tempo as it related to human communication More specifically chronemics involves the study of both subjective and objective human tempos as they influence and are interdependent with human behavior Further chronemics involves the study of human communication as it relates to interdependent and integrated levels of time-experiencing Previously these interdependent and integrated levels have been outlined and discussed as biological time psychological time social time and cultural time A number of classification systems exist in the literature of time However such systems are not applied to human interaction directly \n Chronemics can be defined as \"the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of time\" \n this quote needs a citation \n the way in which one perceives and values \n time \n structures time and reacts to time frames communication Time perception plays a large role in the nonverbal communication process Time perceptions include \n punctuality \n willingness to wait and interactions The use of time can affect lifestyle daily agendas speed of speech movements and how long people are willing to listen \n Time can be used as an indicator of status For example in most companies the boss can interrupt progress to hold an impromptu meeting in the middle of the work day yet the average worker would have to make an appointment to see the boss The way in which different cultures perceive time can influence communication as well \n Cultures are sometimes \n when? \n considered \n monochronic \n or \n polychronic \n Monochronic time \n A monochronic time system means that things are done one at a time and time is segmented into precise small units Under this system time is scheduled arranged and managed \n The \n United States \n considers itself a monochronic \n society \n This perception came about during the \n Industrial Revolution \n when \"factory life required the labor force to be on hand and in place at an appointed hour\" Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p Many Americans like to think that to them time is a precious resource not to be wasted or taken lightly \"We buy time save time spend time and make time Our time can be broken down into years months days hours minutes seconds and even milliseconds We use time to structure both our daily lives and events that we are planning for the future We have schedules that we must follow appointments that we must go to at a certain time classes that start and end at certain times work schedules that start and end at certain times and even our favorite TV shows that start and end at a certain time \" \n As communication scholar \n Edward T Hall \n wrote regarding the American's viewpoint of time in the business world \"the schedule is sacred \" Hall says that for monochronic cultures such as the American culture \"time is tangible\" and viewed as a commodity where \"time is money\" or \"time is wasted \" The result of this perspective is that monochronic cultures place a paramount value on schedules tasks and \"getting the job done \" \n full citation needed \n These cultures are committed to regimented schedules and may view those who do not subscribe to the same perception of time as disrespectful inefficient or unreliable \n Polychronic time \n A polychronic time system is a system where several things can be done at once and wider view of time is exhibited and time is perceived in large fluid sections \n Examples of polychronic behaviors include typing while answering telephones or taking notes while sitting participating in meetings Polychronicity is in contrast to those who prefer monochronicity doing one thing at a time \n Polychronic cultures are much less focused on the preciseness of accounting for each and every moment As Raymond Cohen notes polychronic cultures are more focused on tradition and relationships rather than on tasksa clear difference from their monochronic counterparts Cohen notes that \"Traditional societies have all the time in the world The arbitrary divisions of the clock face have little saliency in cultures grounded in the cycle of the seasons the invariant pattern of rural life community life and the calendar of religious festivities\" Cohen p \n Polychronic culture is more focused on relationships rather than watching the clock Polychronic societies have no problem being \"late\" for an appointment if they are deeply focused on some work or in a meeting that ran past schedule because the concept of time is fluid and can easily expand or contract as need be As a result polychronic cultures have a much less formal perception of time They are not ruled by precise calendars and schedules Rather \"cultures that use the polychronic time system often schedule multiple appointments simultaneously so keeping on schedule is an impossibility \" \n Measuring polychronicity \n Researchers have developed the following questionnaires to measure polychronicity \n Inventory of Polychronic Values IPV \n developed by Bluedorn et al which is a 10-item scale designed to assess \"the extent to which people in a culture prefer to be engaged in two or more tasks or events simultaneously and believe their preference is the best way to do things \" \n Polychronic Attitude Index PAI \n developed by Kaufman-Scarborough & Lindquist in which is a 4-item scale measuring individual preference for polychronicity in the following statements \n \"I do not like to juggle several activities at the same time\" \n \"People should not try to do many things at once\" \n \"When I sit down at my desk I work on one project at a time\" \n \"I am comfortable doing several things at the same time\" \n Predictable patterns between cultures with differing time systems \n Monochronic people \n Polychronic people \n Do one thing at a time \n Do many things at once \n Concentrate on a task set before them \n Concentrate on an event happening around them \n Consider time commitments deadlines schedules seriously \n Consider objectives goals results seriously \n Are low-context and need information \n Are high-context and already have information \n Are committed to the job and end results \n Are committed to people and relationships \n Dedicate themselves to plans \n Change plans often and easily \n Are more concerned with privacy and individual ownership \n Are more concerned with community and shared connections \n Emphasize prompt time recognition regardless of relationship or circumstances \n Emphasize response based on nature of relationship and circumstances \n Have strong tendency to build temporary practical relationships \n Have strong tendency to build lifetime familial relationships \n Cross-cultural perspectives on time \n Conflicting attitudes between the monochronic and polychronic perceptions of time can interfere with cross-cultural relations and similar challenges can occur within an otherwise assimilated culture \n One example in the United States is the \n Hawaiian culture \n which employs two time systems \n Haole \n time and Hawaiian time \n \"When you hear someone say 'See you at two o'clock haole time ' they mean they will just that Haole time is when the person will meet when they say they will meet But if you were to hear someone say 'I'll be there at two o'clock Hawaiian time ' then something different is implied Hawaiian time is very lax and it basically means 'when you get there '\" Nick Lewis \n Time orientations \n The way an individual perceives time and the role time plays in their lives is a learned perspective As discussed by Alexander Gonzalez and Phillip Zimbardo \"every child learns a time perspective that is appropriate to the values and needs of his society\" Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p \n There are four basic psychological time orientations \n Past \n Time-line \n Present \n Future \n Each orientation affects the structure content and urgency of communication Burgoon The \n past \n orientation has a hard time developing the notion of elapsed time and these individuals often confuse present and past happenings as all in the same People oriented with time-line cognitivity are often detail oriented and think of everything in linear terms These individuals also often have difficulty with comprehending multiple events at the same time Individuals with a present orientation are mostly characterized as pleasure seekers who live for the moment and have a very low risk aversion Those individuals who operate with \n future orientation \n are often thought of as being highly goal oriented and focused on the broad picture \n The use of time as a communicative channel can be a powerful yet subtle force in face-to-face \n interactions \n Some of the more recognizable types of interaction that use time are \n Regulating interaction \n This is shown to aid in the orderly transition of conversational \n turn-taking \n When the speaker is opening the floor for a response they will pause However when no response is desired the speaker will talk a faster pace with minimal pause Capella \n Expressing intimacy \n As relationships become more intimate certain changes are made to accommodate the new relationship status Some of the changes that are made include lengthening the time spent on mutual gazes increasing the amount of time doing tasks for or with the other person and planning for the future by making plans to spend more time together Patterson \n Affect management \n The onset of powerful emotions can cause a stronger affect ranging from joy to sorrow or even to embarrassment Some of the behaviors associated with negative affects include decreased time of gaze and awkwardly long pauses during conversations When this happens it is common for the individuals to try and decrease any negative affects and subsequently strengthen positive affects Edelman & Iwawaki \n Evoking emotion \n Time can be used to evoke emotions in an interpersonal relationship by communicating the value of the relationship For example when someone who you have a close relationship with is late you may not take it personally especially if that is characteristic of them However if it is a meeting with a total stranger their disrespect for the value of your time may be taken personally and could even cause you to display negative emotions if and when they do arrive for the meeting \n Facilitating service and task goals \n Professional settings can sometimes give rise to interpersonal relations which are quite different from other \"normal\" interactions For example the societal norms that dictate minimal touch between strangers are clearly altered if one member of the dyad is a doctor and the environment is that of a hospital examination room \n Time orientation and consumers \n Time orientation has also revealed insights into how people react to advertising Martin Gnoth and Strong found that future-oriented consumers react most favorably to ads that feature a product to be released in the distant future and that highlight primary product attributes In contrast present-oriented consumers prefer near-future ads that highlight secondary product attributes Consumer attitudes were mediated by the perceived usefulness of the attribute information \n Culture and diplomacy \n Cultural roots \n Just as monochronic and polychronic cultures have different time perspectives understanding the time orientation of a culture is critical to becoming better able to successfully handle \n diplomatic \n situations Americans think they have a future orientation Hall indicates that for Americans \"tomorrow is more important\" and that they \"are oriented almost entirely toward the future\" Cohen p The future-focused orientation attributes to at least some of the concern that Americans have with \"addressing immediate issues and moving on to new challenges\" Cohen p \n On the other hand many polychronic cultures have a past-orientation toward time \n These time perspectives are the seeds for communication clashes in diplomatic situations Trade negotiators have observed that \"American negotiators are generally more anxious for agreement because \"they are always in a hurry\" and basically \"problem solving oriented \" In other words they place a high value on resolving an issue quickly calling to mind the American catchphrase \"some solution is better than no solution\" Cohen p Similar observations have been made of \n Japanese \n -American relations Noting the difference in time perceptions between the two countries former ambassador to \n Tokyo \n Mike Mansfield \n commented \"We're too fast they're too slow\" Cohen p \n Influence on global affairs \n Different perceptions of time across cultures can influence global communication When writing about time perspective Gonzalez and Zimbardo comment that \"There is no more powerful pervasive influence on how individuals think and cultures interact than our different perspectives on timethe way we learn how we mentally partition time into past present and future \" Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p \n Depending upon where an individual is from their perception of time might be that \"the \n clock \n rules the day\" or that \"we'll get there when we get there \" \n this quote needs a citation \n Improving prospects for success in the global community requires understanding cultural differences \n traditions \n and communication styles \n according to whom? \n The monochronic-oriented approach to negotiations is direct linear and rooted in the characteristics that illustrate low context tendencies The low context culture approaches diplomacy in a lawyerly dispassionate fashion with a clear idea of acceptable outcomes and a plan for reaching them Draft arguments would be prepared elaborating positions A monochronic culture more concerned with time deadlines and schedules tends to grow impatient and want to rush to \"close the deal \" \n More polychronic-oriented cultures come to diplomatic situations with no particular importance placed on time Chronemics is one of the channels of \n nonverbal \n communication preferred by a High context Polychronic negotiator over verbal communication The polychronic approach to negotiations will emphasis building trust between participants forming coalitions and finding consensus High context Polychronic negotiators might be charged with emotion toward a subject thereby obscuring an otherwise obvious solution \n Control of time in power relationships \n Personal boundaries \n Time has a definite relationship to \n power \n Though power most often refers to the ability to influence people Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p power is also related to dominance and status Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p \n For example in the workplace those in a leadership or management position treat time and by virtue of position have their time treated differently from those who are of a lower stature position Anderson and Bowman have identified three specific examples of how chronemics and power converge in the \n workplace \n waiting time talk time and work time \n Waiting time \n Researchers Insel and Lindgren Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p write that the act of making an individual of a lower stature wait is a sign of dominance They note that one who \"is in the position to cause another to wait has power over him To be kept waiting is to imply that one's time is less valuable than that of the one who imposes the wait \" \n Talk time \n There is a direct correlation between the power of an individual in an organization and conversation This includes both length of conversation turn-taking and who initiates and ends a conversation Extensive research indicates that those with more power in an organization will speak more often and for a greater length of time Meetings between superiors and subordinates provide an opportunity to illustrate this concept A superior regardless of whether or not they are running the actual meeting lead discussions ask questions and have the ability to speak for longer periods of time without interruption Likewise research shows that turn-taking is also influenced by power Social psychologist Nancy Henley notes that \"Subordinates are expected to yield to superiors and there is a cultural expectation that a subordinate will not interrupt a superior\" Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p The length of response follows the same pattern While the superior can speak for as long as they want the responses of the subordinate are shorter in length \n Albert Mehrabian \n noted that deviation from this pattern led to negative perceptions of the subordinate by the superior Beginning and ending a communication interaction in the workplace is also controlled by the higher-status individual in an organization The time and duration of the conversation are dictated by the higher-status individual \n Work time \n The time of high status individuals is perceived as valuable and they control their own time On the other hand a subordinate with less power has their time controlled by a higher status individual and are in less control of their time making them likely to report their time to a higher authority Such practices are more associated with those in non-supervisory roles or in blue collar rather than \n white collar \n professions Instead as power and status in an organization increases the flexibility of the work schedule also increases For instance while administrative professionals might keep a \n to \n work schedule their superiors may keep less structured hours This does not mean that the superior works less They may work longer but the structure of their work environment is not strictly dictated by the traditional work day Instead as Koehler and their associates note \"individuals who spend more time especially spare time to meetings to committees and to developing contacts are more likely to be influential decision makers\" Guerrero DeVito & Hecht p \n A specific example of the way power is expressed through work time is scheduling As Yakura and others have noted in research shared by Ballard and Seibold \"scheduling reflects the extent to which the sequencing and duration of plans activities and events are formalized\" Ballard and Seibold p Higher-status individuals have very precise and formal schedules indicating that their stature requires that they have specific blocks of time for specific meetings projects and appointments Lower status individuals however may have less formalized schedules Finally the schedule and appointment calendar of the higher status individual will take precedence in determining where when and the importance of a specific event or appointment \n Associated theories \n Expectancy violations theory \n Developed by \n Judee Burgoon \n expectancy violations theory \n EVT sees communication as the exchange of information which is high in relational content and can be used to violate the expectations of another which will be perceived as either positively or negatively depending on the liking between the two people \n When our expectations are violated we will respond in specific ways If an act is unexpected and is assigned favorable interpretation and it is evaluated positively it will produce more favorable outcomes than an expected act with the same interpretation and evaluation \n Interpersonal adaptation theory \n Interpersonal adaptation theory \n The interpersonal adaptation theory IAT founded by Judee Burgoon states that adaptation in interaction is responsive to the needs expectations and desires of communicators and affects how communicators position themselves in relation to one another and adapt to one another's communication For example they may match each other's behavior synchronize the timing of behavior or behave in dissimilar ways It is also important to note that individuals bring to interactions certain requirements that reflect basic human needs expectations about behavior based on social norms and desires for interaction based on goals and personal preferences Burgoon Stern & Dillman \n African time \n Paul Virilio"},

list with additional or specialized categories such as \"spirituality\" \n \"truth\" \n and \"time/punctuality\" \n Types \n Nina Brown proposed four boundary types \n Soft \n A person with soft boundaries merges with other people's boundaries Someone with a soft boundary is easily a victim of \n psychological manipulation \n Spongy \n A person with spongy boundaries is like a combination of having soft and rigid boundaries They permit less \n emotional contagion \n than soft boundaries but more than those with rigid People with spongy boundaries are unsure of what to let in and what to keep out \n Rigid \n A person with rigid boundaries is closed or walled off so nobody can get close either physically or emotionally This is often the case if someone has been the victim of \n physical \n emotional \n psychological \n or \n sexual abuse \n Rigid boundaries can be \n selective \n which depend on time place or circumstances and are usually based on a bad previous experience in a similar situation \n Flexible \n Similar to spongy rigid boundaries but the person exercises more control The person decides what to let in and what to keep out is resistant to \n emotional contagion \n and \n psychological manipulation \n and is difficult to exploit \n Application \n The personal boundaries concept is particularly pertinent in environments with controlling people or people not taking responsibility for their own life \n Co-Dependents Anonymous \n recommends setting limits on what members will do to and for people and on what members will allow people to do to and for them as part of their efforts to establish autonomy from being controlled by other peoples thoughts feelings and problems \n The \n National Alliance on Mental Illness \n tells its members that establishing and maintaining values and boundaries will improve the sense of security stability predictability and order in a family even when some members of the family resist NAMI contends that boundaries encourage a more relaxed nonjudgmental atmosphere and that the presence of boundaries need not conflict with the need for maintaining an understanding atmosphere \n Risks of reestablishing \n In \n Families and How to Survive Them \n Robin Skynner \n MD explains methods for how family therapists can effectively help family members to develop clearer values and boundaries by when treating them drawing lines and treating different generations in different compartments \n something especially pertinent in families where unhealthy \n enmeshment \n overrides normal personal values \n However the establishment of personal values and boundaries in such instances may produce a negative fall-out \n if the pathological state of enmeshment had been a central attraction or element of the relationship \n This is especially true if the establishment of healthy boundaries results in unilateral limit setting which did not occur previously It is important to distinguish between unilateral limits and collaborative solutions in these settings \n Anger \n Anger \n is a normal \n emotion \n that involves a strong uncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation Often it indicates when one's personal boundaries are violated Anger may be utilized effectively by setting boundaries or escaping from dangerous situations \n Complicating factors \n Addictions \n Addicts often believe that being in control of others is how to achieve success and happiness in life People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill having usually learned it in childhood As long as they make the rules no one can back them into a corner with their feelings \n Mental illness \n People with certain mental conditions are predisposed to \n controlling behavior \n including those with \n obsessive compulsive disorder \n paranoid personality disorder \n borderline personality disorder \n and \n narcissistic personality disorder \n attention deficit disorder \n and the manic state of \n bipolar disorder \n Borderline personality disorder BPD \n There is a tendency for loved ones of people with BPD to slip into caretaker roles giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives Too often in these relationships the codependent will gain a sense of worth by being \"the sane one\" or \"the responsible one\" \n Narcissistic personality disorder NPD \n For those involved with a person with NPD values and boundaries are often challenged as narcissists have a poor sense of \n self \n and often do not recognize that others are fully separate and not extensions of themselves Those who meet their needs and those who provide gratification may be treated as if they are part of the narcissist and expected to live up to their expectations \n Codependency \n Codependency \n often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others Codependency can occur in any type of relationship including family work friendship and also romantic peer or community relationships \n While a healthy relationship depends on the emotional space provided by personal boundaries \n co-dependent personalities have difficulties in setting such limits so that defining and protecting boundaries efficiently may be for them a vital part of regaining mental health \n In a codependent relationship the codependent's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy clinginess where one person doesn't have self-sufficiency or autonomy One or both parties depend on the other for fulfillment \n There is usually an unconscious reason for continuing to put

legislation A veto can be absolute as for instance in the \n United Nations Security Council \n whose permanent members China France Russia United Kingdom and the United States of America can block any resolution or it can be limited as in the legislative process of the United States where a two-thirds vote in both the \n House \n and \n Senate \n may override a Presidential veto of legislation \n A veto may give power only to stop changes thus allowing its holder to protect the \n status quo \n like the US legislative veto mentioned before or to also adopt them an \"amendatory veto\" like the legislative veto of the Indian President which allows him to propose amendments to bills returned to the Parliament for reconsideration \n The concept of a veto body originated with the \n Roman \n consuls \n and \n tribunes \n Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the \n Roman Senate \n Roman veto \n Westminster systems \n Australia \n Canada \n India \n Spain \n United Kingdom \n United States \n According to the Constitution \n Modifications declared unconstitutional \n Early history \n Intent of the Framers \n Under the Articles and Constitution \n U S states veto powers and override authority \n European republican systems \n Presidential veto \n Liberum veto \n Philippines \n Roman veto \n The institution of the veto known to the Romans as the \n intercessio \n was adopted by the \n Roman Republic \n in the 6th century BC to enable the tribunes to protect the interests of the \n plebs \n common citizenry from the encroachments of the \n patricians \n who dominated the Senate A tribune's veto did not prevent the senate from passing a bill but meant that it was denied the force of law The tribunes could also use the veto to prevent a bill from being brought before the plebeian assembly The consuls also had the power of veto as decision-making generally required the assent of both consuls If one disagreed either could invoke the \n intercessio \n to block the action of the other The veto was an essential component of the Roman conception of power being wielded not only to manage state affairs but to moderate and restrict the power of the state's high officials and institutions \n Westminster systems \n In \n Westminster systems \n and most \n constitutional monarchies \n the power to veto legislation by withholding the \n Royal Assent \n is a rarely used \n reserve power \n of the monarch In practice the Crown follows the convention of exercising its prerogative on the advice of its chief advisor the prime minister \n Australia \n Since the \n Statute of Westminster \n the United Kingdom Parliament may not repeal any Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia on the grounds that is repugnant to the laws and interests of the United Kingdom \n Other countries in the \n Commonwealth of Nations \n not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia such as Canada and New Zealand are likewise affected However according to the \n Australian Constitution \n sec the \n Queen \n may veto a bill that has been given royal assent by the \n Governor-General \n within one year of the legislation being assented to \n This power has never been used The Australian Governor-General himself or herself has in theory power to veto or more technically withhold assent to a bill passed by both houses of the \n Australian Parliament \n and contrary to the advice of the prime minister \n This may be done without consulting the sovereign as per Section of the constitution \n When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent he shall declare according to his discretion but subject to this Constitution that he assents in the Queen's name or that he withholds assent or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure The Governor-General may return to the house in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend and the Houses may deal with the recommendation \n This \n reserve power \n is however constitutionally arguable and it is difficult to foresee an occasion when such a power would need to be exercised It is possible that a Governor-general might so act if a bill passed by the Parliament was in violation of the Constitution \n One might argue however that a government would be hardly likely to present a bill which is so open to rejection Many of the viceregal reserve powers are untested because of the brief constitutional history of the Commonwealth of Australia and the observance of the convention that the head of state acts upon the advice of his or her chief minister The power may also be used in a situation where the parliament usually a \n hung parliament \n passes a bill without the blessing of the executive The governor general on the advice of the executive could withhold consent from the bill thereby preventing its passage into law \n With regard to the six governors of the states which are federated under the Australian Commonwealth a somewhat different situation exists Until the \n Australia Act \n each state was constitutionally dependent upon the British Crown directly Since however they are fully independent entities although the Queen still appoints governors on the advice of the state head of government the \n premier \n So the Crown may not veto nor the UK Parliament overturn any act of a state governor or state legislature Paradoxically the states are more independent of the Crown than the federal government and legislature \n State constitutions determine what role a governor plays In general the governor exercises the powers the sovereign would have including the power to withhold the Royal Assent \n Canada \n According to the \n Constitution Act \n the \n Governor General of Canada \n may veto a bill by refusing \n Royal Assent \n If the \n Governor General \n withholds the Queen's assent the sovereign may within two years disallow the bill thereby vetoing the law in question However this power has never been used \n Provincial viceroys called \" \n Lieutenant Governors \n \" plural however are able to reserve Royal Assent to provincial bills for the governor general this clause was last invoked in by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan \n India \n President of India Important presidential interventions in the past \n In India the president has three veto powers i e absolute suspension & pocket The president can send the bill back to parliament for changes which constitutes a limited veto that can be overridden by a simple majority But the Bill reconsidered by the parliament becomes a law with or without the assents of President after days The president can also take no action indefinitely on a bill sometimes referred to as a pocket veto The president can refuse to assent which constitutes an absolute veto \n Spain \n In Spain Section of the Constitution provides that the King shall give his assent to laws passed by the General Courts within days after their final passing by them The absence of the royal assent although not constitutionally provided \n clarification needed \n would mean the bill did not become a part of the law Section of the Constitution states that \"Within two months after receiving the text the Senate may by a message stating the reasons for it adopt a veto or approve amendments thereto The veto must be adopted by overall majority \" \n United Kingdom \n In the United Kingdom the royal veto \"withholding \n Royal Assent \n \" was last exercised in by \n Queen Anne \n with the \n Scottish Militia Bill \n The \n House of Lords \n used to have an effective power of veto by refusing to concur in bills adopted by the \n House of Commons \n However reform first by a Liberal government and then by a Labour government has limited its powers The \n Parliament Acts of and \n reduced its powers they can now only amend and delay legislation They can delay legislation for up to one year Under the Act money bills those concerning finance cannot be delayed and under the \n Salisbury Convention \n the Lords by \n convention \n cannot delay any bills set out in the governing party's manifesto \n United States \n According to the Constitution \n List of United States presidential vetoes \n Line-item veto in the United States \n and \n Pocket veto \n All legislation passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the President This presentation is in the President's capacity as Head of Government \n If the President approves of the legislation then the President signs it into law According to \n Article Section \n of the Constitution \n when the President chooses not to sign or does not approve of the bill the President must return the \n bill \n unsigned within ten days excluding Sundays to the house of the \n United States Congress \n in which it originated while the Congress is \n in session \n The President is constitutionally required to state any objections to the bill in writing and the Congress is constitutionally required to consider them and to reconsider the legislation This action in effect is a veto \n If the Congress overrides the veto by a \n two-thirds vote \n in each house it becomes law without the President's signature Otherwise the bill fails to become law unless it is presented to the President again and the President chooses to sign it \n Historically the Congress \n overrides \n the Presidential veto 7% of the time \n A bill can also become law without the President's signature if after its presentment the President simply fails to sign it within the ten days noted If there are fewer than ten days left in the session before Congress \n adjourns \n and if Congress does so adjourn before the ten days have expired in which the President might sign the bill then the bill fails to become law This procedure when used as a formal device is called a \n pocket veto \n

\n grounds and on grounds that the action by one house of Congress violated the Constitutional requirement of bicameralism The case was \n INS v Chadha \n concerning a foreign exchange student in \n Ohio \n who had been born in Kenya but whose parents were from India Because he was not born in India he was not an Indian citizen Because his parents were not Kenyan citizens he was not Kenyan Thus he \n had nowhere to go \n when his student visa expired because neither country would take him so he overstayed his visa and was ordered to show cause why he should not be deported from the United States \n The Immigration and Nationality Act was one of many acts of Congress passed since the 1930s which contained a provision allowing either house of that legislature to nullify decisions of agencies in the executive branch simply by passing a resolution In this case Chadha's deportation was suspended and the \n House of Representatives \n passed a resolution overturning the suspension so that the deportation proceedings would continue This the Court held amounted to the House of Representatives passing legislation without the concurrence of the Senate and without presenting the legislation to the President for consideration and approval or veto Thus the Constitutional principle of bicameralism and the separation of powers doctrine were disregarded in this case and this legislative veto of executive decisions was struck down \n In the \n United States Congress \n passed and President \n Bill Clinton \n signed the \n Line Item Veto Act of \n This \n act \n allowed the President to veto individual items of budgeted expenditures from appropriations bills instead of vetoing the entire bill and sending it back to the Congress However this \n line-item veto \n was immediately challenged by members of Congress who disagreed with it In the \n Supreme Court \n declared the line-item veto unconstitutional The Court found the language of the Constitution required each bill presented to the President to be either approved or rejected as a whole An action by which the President might pick and choose which parts of the bill to approve or not approve amounted to the President acting as a legislator instead of an executive and \n head of state \n and particularly as a single legislator acting in place of the entire Congressthereby violating the \n separation of powers \n doctrine See \n Clinton v City of New York \n U S \n In Senator \n Bill Frist \n introduced the \n Legislative Line Item Veto Act of \n in the \n United States Senate \n Rather than provide for an actual legislative veto however the procedure created by the Act provides that if the President should recommend rescission of a budgetary line item from a budget bill he previously signed into lawa power he already possesses pursuant to U S Const Art IIthe Congress must vote on his request within ten days Because the legislation that is the subject of the President's request or \"Special Message\" in the language of the bill was already enacted and signed into law the vote by the Congress would be ordinary legislative action not any kind of vetowhether line-item legislative or any other sort The House passed this measure but the Senate never considered it so the bill expired and never became law \n Early history \n Intent of the Framers \n During the \n Constitutional Convention \n the veto was routinely referred to as a 'revisionary power' \n The Veto was constructed not as an absolute veto but rather with limits such as that Congress can override a veto and that the President's objections must be stated in writing \n These limits would have been important in the minds of the Founders given that in Britain the monarch retained an absolute veto though by this time the power had become a formality Further as \n Elbridge Gerry \n explained in the final days of the Convention \"The primary object of the revisionary check of the President is not to protect the general interest but to defend his own department \" \n During the Constitutional Convention the framers overwhelmingly rejected three proposals for an absolute veto \n Under the Articles and Constitution \n The \n Presidents \n of the \n Continental Congress \n did not have the power of veto The President could not veto an act of Congress under the \n Articles of Confederation \n but he possessed certain recess and reserve powers that were not necessarily available to the predecessor President of the Continental Congress It was only with the enactment of the \n United States Constitution \n drafted ratified fully effective since March that veto power was conferred upon the person titled \"President of the United States\" \n citation needed \n The presidential veto power was first exercised on April when President \n George Washington \n vetoed a bill outlining a new apportionment formula \n Apportionment described how Congress divides seats in the House of Representatives among the states based on the US census figures President Washington thought the bill gave an unfair advantage to the northern states \n citation needed \n The Congress first overrode a presidential veto passed a bill into law notwithstanding the President's objections on March \n U S states veto powers and override authority \n All U S states also have a provision by which legislative decisions can be vetoed by the governor In addition to the ability to veto an entire bill as a \"package \" many states allow the governor to exercise specialty veto authority to strike or revise portions of a bill without striking the whole bill \n Amendatory veto \n Allows a governor to amend bills that have been passed by the legislature Revisions are subject to confirmation or rejection by the legislature \n Line item veto \n Allows a governor to remove specific sections of a bill usually only spending bills that has been passed by the legislature Deletions can be

since refused to sign two other bills The first bill was withdrawn but the latter two resulted in referenda \n The \n President of France \n has only a very limited form of suspensive veto when presented with a law he or she can request another reading of it by the Assembly but only once per law Aside from it the President can only refer bills to the \n Constitutional Council \n The \n President of Hungary \n has two options to veto a bill submit it to the \n Constitutional Court \n if he suspects that it violates the constitution or send it back to the \n Parliament \n and ask for a second debate and vote on the bill If the Court rules that the bill is constitutional or it is passed by the Parliament again respectively the President must sign it \n The \n President of Ireland \n may refuse to grant assent to a bill that he or she considers to be unconstitutional after consulting the \n Council of State \n in this case the bill is referred to the \n Supreme Court \n which finally determines the matter This is the most widely used reserve power The President may also on request of a majority of \n Seanad ireann \n the upper house of parliament and a third of \n Dil ireann \n the lower house of parliament after consulting the Council of State decline to sign a bill \"of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained\" in an \n ordinary referendum \n or a new Dil reassembling after a general election held within eighteen months This latter power has never been used because the government of the day almost always commands a majority of the Seanad preventing the third of the Dil that usually makes up the opposition from combining with it \n The \n President of Italy \n may request a second deliberation of a bill passed by Parliament before it is promulgated This is a very weak form of veto as the Parliament can override the veto by an ordinary majority The same provision exists in France and Latvia While such a limited veto cannot thwart the will of a determined parliamentary majority it may have a delaying effect and may cause the parliamentary majority to reconsider the matter The President of Republic can also call a new election for parliament \n The \n President of Estonia \n may effectively veto a law adopted by \n Estonian parliament \n by refusing to proclaim it and demanding a new debate and decision The parliament in its turn may override this veto by passing the law unamended for the second time a simple majority is enough In this case the President is obliged to proclaim the law or to request the \n Supreme Court of Estonia \n to declare the law unconstitutional If the Supreme Court rules that the law does not violate the \n Constitution \n the President may not object any more and is obliged to finally proclaim the law \n The \n President of Latvia \n may suspend a bill for a period of two months during which it may be referred to the people in a referendum if a certain number of signatures are gathered This is potentially a much stronger form of veto as it enables the President to appeal to the people against the wishes of the Parliament and Government \n The \n President

dynasties which came to an end in the mid-17th century These were followed by an elective kingship As might be expected the more and more frequent use of this veto power paralyzed the power of the

leadership \n Due to the many theoretical and practical applications of goal orientation it is important to understand the construct and how it relates to other variables In this entry goal orientation will be reviewed in terms of its history stability dimensionality antecedents its relationship to goal setting and consequences its relevance to motivation and future directions for research \n Historical perspective \n Early conceptualizations \n Recent conceptualizations \n State versus trait \n Types \n Communications \n Learning \n Learning-approach and learning-avoidance \n

\n Metacognition \n Feedback seeking and interpretation \n Academic outcomes \n Organizational outcomes \n Learning environments \n Historical perspective \n Early conceptualizations \n The earliest conceptualizations of goal orientation were proposed in the 1970s by the educational psychologist J A Eison Eison \n argued that students who approached college as an opportunity to acquire new skills and knowledge possessed a learning orientation while students who approached college with the goal to exclusively obtain high grades possessed a grade orientation Eison originally believed that these two orientations were two ends of the same continuum and developed the Learning Orientation-Grade Orientation Scale to measure the continuum At about the same time J G Nicholls \n was developing a related theory that achievement motivation would lead grade school children to set high task related goals Nicholls \n found that when some high-ability children encountered difficult tasks they would use maladaptive strategies leading to eventual feelings of helplessness while others would use more productive \n coping strategies \n Nicholls later conceptualized these differences as two types of achievement goals a task involvement where individuals seek to develop their competence relative to their own abilities and b ego involvement where individuals seek to develop their competence relative to the abilities of others \n Nicholls's early work set up Dweck's \n proposition of two types of \n goal orientation \n learning orientation and performance orientation \n Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations with the goal to master the acquisition of new skills while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations with the goal of gaining approval from peers and teachers Similar to Eison Dweck \n conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct Individuals with a learning goal orientation sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation or abbreviated as LGO seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations They are not concerned about their performance relative to others but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task \n Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence in order to receive favorable judgments and avoid negative judgments Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual \n Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs \n More recently researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation style simultaneously persons can be high in both learning and performance orientations low in both learning and performance orientations or high in one orientation and low in the other Ultimately individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time striving to both outperform competitors and improve their own performance This led to the conceptualization of two separate continuums one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation \n Recent conceptualizations \n Just over a decade after Dweck conceptualized the two-factor model of goal orientation VandeWalle \n proposed that goal orientation is better conceptualized as a three-factor model further dividing performance goal orientation into the dimensions of avoidant performance goal orientation APGO and prove performance goal orientation PPGO APGO is centered on the goal of avoiding failure and negative judgment from others centered on lack of competence while PPGO is centered on demonstrating performance to prove competence Learning goal orientation has also been separated into two categories learning approach orientation and learning avoid orientation \n however this conceptualization is neither widely accepted nor substantially proven According to VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n APGO and PPGO have differing relationships with various outcome variables supporting the argument that a three-factor model should be used in place of the originally conceptualized two-factor model \n State versus trait \n There has been great debate if goal orientation should be operationalized as a \n state \n or as a \n trait \n Throughout the goal orientation literature there are inconsistencies with regard to the conceptualization of the stability of the construct For example DeShon & Gillespie \n stated that in the literature goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait quasi-trait and state They articulated that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\" p \n State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation However state goal orientation is \"specific to the task and context at hand\" p \n For example VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n stated that goal orientation can be domain specific They stated that it is possible for an individual to have a strong learning goal orientation in their academic domain but not in their work domain Trait goal orientation refers to the \"consistent pattern of responses in achievement situations based on the individual's standing on goal orientation dimensions\" \n This view of goal orientation treats the construct as a stable individual difference characteristic Button Mathieu & Zajac \n take an integrative view of the construct stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics These authors found that when few situational cues are present individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations However when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation p \n Thus trait and state goal orientation interact so both operationalizations should be considered simultaneously \n Types \n Since the realization that performance goal orientation is best split into two separate parts researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of these three dimensions to goal orientation Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church \n and VandeWalle \n demonstrated that the factor structure of Goal Orientation does indeed lend itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness \n Communications \n In communications there is a theory that coincides with this overall concept The theory is titled the Theory of Goal-oriented communications The idea behind it is that when communicating if individuals are concentrated on the goal at hand rather than the communication itself it will lessen confusion Communication is not the goal in itself but something bigger getting a planned idea across \n Communication is a goal Oriented Communication can be effective if the sender and receiver both are awere of the goal of communication and there is congruence of their goals \n Learning \n VandeWalle defines learning goal orientation as the \"desire to develop the self by acquiring new skills mastering new situations and improving one's competence\" p \n Persons with learning goal orientation seek feedback on past performance to evaluate current performance These individuals focus on improving skills and acquiring knowledge and are less concerned with making mistakes Research shows that adoption of mastery goals leads to greater intrinsic motivation as opposed to performance approach or performance avoid which are associated with external motivation \n One area where this can be seen as important is in the area of curriculum design When designing learning environments for students it is important to create opportunities that promote learning goals as opposed to performance goals One possible implication for educators is the need to emphasize knowledge-centered classroom environments that encourage \"doing with understanding\" \n Learning-approach and learning-avoidance \n Although learning goal orientation is most commonly conceptualized as a single construct researchers have begun to make the approach and avoidance distinction that they have previously done with the performance goal orientation According to Elliot \n learning-approach goals \"entail striving to develop one's skills and abilities advance one's learning understand material or complete or master a task\" p This type of learning goal orientation is consistent with the way general learning goal orientation has been conceptualized previously Alternatively learning-avoidance goals \"entail striving to avoid losing one's skills and abilities or having their development stagnate forgetting what one has learned misunderstanding material or leaving a task incomplete or unmastered\" \n p Individuals are likely to pursue learning-avoidance goals when they feel that their skills or abilities are deteriorating For example an elderly individual may notice that his/her physical and mental capacity is declining and as a result may focus his/her goals on sustaining or improving these diminishing capacities \n Prove performance \n VandeWalle defines performance prove goal orientation as the \"desire to prove one's competence and to gain favorable judgments about it\" p \n The performance approach orientation represents a desire to achieve a high level of performance Persons with performance approach orientation seek positive reinforcement and feedback \n These individuals don't want to put forth a lot of effort unless they will be positively evaluated and tend to avoid tasks where they may make mistakes and therefore be poorly evaluated \n Avoid performance \n Finally VandeWalle defines avoid performance as the \"desire to avoid the disproving of one's competence and to avoid negative judgments about it\" p \n The performance avoid orientation represents a desire to avoid instances of low believes Persons with performance avoid orientation focus on avoiding situations in which they will receive evaluations or risk demonstrating lack of confidence Individuals high in fear of failure are more likely to adopt performance avoid goals \n Antecedents \n Throughout the goal orientation literature many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents These antecedents have been identified as having varying levels of importance In a meta-analysis by Payne and her colleagues \n both need for achievement and the \n Big Five personality traits \n were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents \n Cognitive ability \n Cognitive ability \n Research has produced mixed results when examining the relationship between cognitive ability and goal orientation For example Eison \n found that learning-oriented learning goal orientation students had higher levels of cognitive ability than grade-oriented performance goal orientation students However Dweck and her colleagues were unable to find any relationship between the constructs \n Although findings are mixed \"a substantial body of theory and research suggests motivational and ability traits are generally uncorrelated\" p \n In a \n meta-analysis \n by Payne and her colleagues \n cognitive ability and goal orientation were found to be independent constructs Accordingly individuals with high cognitive ability are equally likely to hold learning prove performance and avoid performance goal orientations These authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond cognitive ability \n Based on this research goal orientation rather than cognitive ability serves as useful tool for practitioners to use to predict job performance \n Need for achievement \n Need for achievement \n Need for achievement refers to the degree to which an individual \"maintains high standards\" and \"aspires to accomplish difficult tasks\" \n Goal orientation dimensions have been conceptualized as manifestations of Atkinson's need for achievement and need to avoid failure competence-relevant motives \n In a meta-analysis by Payne et al \n the authors found that need for achievement was positively correlated with LGO negatively associated with APGO and unrelated to PPGO Another interesting finding by these authors was that need for achievement correlated more strongly with LGO than the trait conscientiousness Although LGO and need for achievement were found to be strongly related the findings demonstrate that LGO is related to but not synonymous with need for achievement \n Big Five personality characteristics \n Big Five personality traits \n Extensive research has been done on personality and many researchers have agreed that personality is best conceptualized as a five-factor model the Big Five \n These traits include extraversion openness to experience emotional stability conscientiousness and agreeableness \n In a study by Zweig and Webster \n the relationship between the Big-Five personality traits and goal orientation was examined The authors found that goal orientation and the Big-Five personality traits are related yet distinct constructs They also found that personality factors combine to create people's various orientations toward learning and goals which in turn predict the types of tasks they will engage in In a meta-analysis by Payne et al \n goal orientation was found to predict job performance over and above the Big-Five \n Goal setting \n Goal setting \n Historically goal setting theory has primarily been concerned with performance goals Locke and Latham \n summarize years of goal setting research by stating that as long as an individual is committed to a goal and has the ability to achieve it specific high hard goals lead to a higher level of task performance than vague or easy goals However the vast majority of goal setting studies have been conducted with a specific performance goal and often in laboratory settings where the task was fairly simple It is possible that when tasks are more complex or require a long-term commitment adopting a learning goal may lead to higher performance Fan Meng Billings Litchfield and Kaplan \n found that the relationship between trait learning goal orientation and goal-setting was moderated by self-efficacy such that individuals high in learning goal orientation and self-efficacy set higher goal that those high in learning goal orientation but low in self-efficacy This finding suggests that while learning goal orientation can influence goal setting the relationship also depends on other factors such as the individual's level of self-efficacy Fan et al also found that learning and prove goal orientations facilitated challenge striving suggesting that either orientation can effectively facilitate motivation for goal attainment Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of complexity inherent in the situation or task In situations with more complex tasks it appears that \"do your best\" goals may actually lead to higher performance than specific goals It is possible that in complex tasks a specific difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure \n Kanfer and Ackerman \n found that in an air traffic controller simulation a highly complex task having a performance-outcome goal actually interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task People performed better when they were asked to do their best This suggests that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings However it may be possible to set a specific difficult learning goal Latham and Brown \n found that when MBA students set specific difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA Locke and Latham \n claim that creating a specific difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance such as in an MBA program \n Consequences and outcomes \n The goal orientation literature has examined the relationships among goal orientation and various proximal e g self-efficacy metacognition & feedback seeking and distal consequences e g academic outcomes organizational outcomes In a meta-analysis by Payne and her colleagues \n the goal orientation dimensions were found to be more strongly related to the self-regulatory constructs i e self-efficacy metacognition & feedback seeking than the performance constructs i e academic and organizational performance They also found that APGO was the only dimension negatively related to the various outcomes Payne and her colleagues found that the learning strategies metacognition would likely fall into this category and self-efficacy are the most important proximal consequences of goal orientation followed by feedback seeking academic outcomes and organizational outcomes The following sections go into more detail about each consequence \n Self-efficacy \n Self-efficacy \n Bandura defined self-efficacy as \"a belief in one's ability to effectively perform and to exercise influence over events\" \n Individuals who are high in self-efficacy set more difficult goals exert more effort to achieve those goals and seek to learn from the processes of pursuing those goals \n In a meta-analysis by Payne et al \n self-efficacy was identified as a proximal outcome of goal orientation Similarly VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n found that LGO was positively related to self-efficacy effort and goal setting level Since \"self-efficacy functions as a primary motivational mechanism by which goal orientation influences subsequent learning processes\" employees with higher levels of self-efficacy will exert more effort toward and learn more from task assignments p \n Metacognition \n Metacognition \n Metacognition is conceptualized as an individual's knowledge and regulation over one's own cognitions \n Individuals high in metacognitive awareness are skilled at monitoring their progress towards goals identifying their strengths and weaknesses and adjusting their learning strategies accordingly to achieve favorable outcomes \n Although there have been relatively few research studies conducted on the role of metacognition in leader development outcomes some studies have found that metacognition plays an important role in such outcomes For example Ford et al \n linked LGO and metacognitive activity and found that metacognitive activity was significantly related to knowledge acquisition post-training performance and self-efficacy In a study by Schmidt & Ford \n metacognitive activity was positively related to LGO as well as cognitive affective and skill based learning outcomes Similarly Bell and Kozlowski \n found that LGO was significantly related to metacognitive activity The National Research Council points out that it is important to remember that metacognitive skills can be taught and essential that teachers explicitly teach metacognitive skills across the curriculum in a variety of subject areas \n Feedback seeking and interpretation \n In an organizational context the extent to which employees actively seek feedback can positively influence job performance \n Goal orientation influences how individuals evaluate the costs and benefits of feedback-seeking opportunities \n According to VandeWalle \n when individuals have the opportunity to seek feedback they face a cognitive dilemma between the need for self-assessment and the need for self-enhancement Since individuals with a learning goal orientation are interested in developing competencies they are more likely to interpret feedback positively and thus engage in more feedback-seeking behaviors to enhance performance These individuals interpret feedback as valuable information about how to correct errors and improve future performance on a given task Conversely individuals with a performance goal orientation are likely to interpret feedback as \"evaluative and judgmental information about the self\" p \n and as a result are less likely to seek feedback Consequently individuals with high levels of learning goal orientation are more inclined to seek feedback while individuals with high levels of prove performance goal orientation or avoid performance goal orientation are less inclined to seek feedback VandeWalle & Cummings \n Academic outcomes \n As previously stated goal orientation refers to individuals' behavioral tendencies in achievement-oriented tasks Therefore it seems intuitive that goal orientation would be associated with various academic outcomes According to Payne et al \n learning goal orientation is positively associated with self-regulatory behaviors such as planning and goal setting which in turn are associated with academic performance Thus individuals with high levels of LGO are more likely to perform well on academic tasks than individuals with high levels of the PGO dimensions \n In addition research has also shown that students' motivation can predict both the quality of the engagement in academic learning as well as the degree to which they seek out or avoid challenging situations \n \"Goal-setting is a technique that is often employed in organization as part of traditional performance appraisals and broader performance management interventions \n \" Englebrecht Heine & Mahembe If all students are to move \"through the increasing challenges and academic rigors\" of school then their motivation to learn must be identified and nurtured \n Organizational outcomes \n Goal orientation has also been linked to organizational outcomes specifically \n job performance \n Payne et al \n found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance They found that PPGO was unrelated to performance The authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics This finding suggests that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest of organizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance In another study by VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n the authors found that individuals with a learning goal orientation had higher sales performance than those with performance goal orientations This finding suggests that in order to be successful in organizational setting individuals must have the desire to develop their skills \n Learning environments \n Research has shown that goal orientation is linked to outcomes and performance \n Much of this research has been centered on outcomes in schools and job performance When examining research on learning environments and curriculum design one could argue that there is significant alignment with LGO and ideal learning environments When designing learning environments there are some essential principles that should be in place These principles were outlined by the National Research Council in their report entitled How People Learn Brain Mind Experience and School \n First classrooms and school need to be learner centered By this teachers need to be aware of the strengths skills attitudes and knowledge that students bring with them when they enter school This should include acknowledging cultural differences and creating a place for the inclusion of their everyday lived experiences in the classroom Second teachers should strive to create a knowledge-centered classroom by focusing on what is taught why it is taught and what competence or mastery looks like The emphasis here should be placed on learning with understanding One way students can demonstrate this understanding is by successfully transferring content and skills to novel situations and problems This also relates back to metacognitive skills that have been demonstrated to be linked to learning goal orientation Next it is important to remember that formative assessments are essential in learning environments This type of ongoing assessments allows teachers to assess where students are and design their instruction accordingly Lastly it is very important to look at the environment in which learning takes place The teacher wants to create an environment that nurtures a learning goal orientation as opposed to a performance goal orientation This means encouraging a community of learners who are willing to take risks and make mistakes for the sake of learning Teachers should create environments that emphasize mastery over performance Performance is primarily focused on learning in the moment and a demarcated demonstration of understanding Mastery implies skill development over a period of time that includes experience and practice Authentic learning occurs when students can not only demonstrate understanding but apply it in multiple settings and to novel situations or problems \n Adaptive

\n The \n need for cognition \n NFC \n in \n psychology \n is a \n personality variable \n reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards \n effortful \n cognitive activities \n Need for cognition has been variously defined as \"a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways\" and \"a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\" \n Higher NFC is associated with increased appreciation of debate idea evaluation and problem solving Those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards \n high elaboration \n Those with a lower need

making \n False memories \n Halo effects \n Relationship with personality traits \n Related constructs \n Other personality characteristics \n Consumers \n Footnotes \n Cohen Stotland and Wolfe \n in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation identified a \" \n need for cognition \n \" which they defined as \"the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully\" the \"need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways\" and \"need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\" p They argued that if this \"need\" were frustrated it would generate \"feelings of tension and deprivation\" that would instigate \"active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding\" p though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary p Cohen argued that even in structured situations people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity \n Cohen and colleagues \n themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition citing works by \n Murphy \n Maslow \n Katz \n Harlow \n and \n Asch \n They \n distinguished their concept from the apparently similar \"intolerance of ambiguity\" proposed by \n Frenkel-Brunswik \n arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is however closer to tolerance of ambiguity need for structure or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition For instance studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get \"meaning\" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information \n Building on this work \n Cacioppo \n therefore moved away from drive-reduction toward measuring \n individual differences \n in the self-reward potential of cognitive activity \n stressing p that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a \"likelihood or tendency\" rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of \"tissue deprivation\" they defined the need for cognition as an individual's tendency to \"engage in and enjoy thinking\" p and the tendency to \"organize abstract and evaluate information\" p or variously as a stable but individually different \"tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors\" or an \"intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors and exercise their mental faculties\" \n or an \"intrinsic motivation for effortful thought\" \n Cacioppo and Petty created their own scale to measure the need for cognition This was subsequently slightly amended \n and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered \n Features \n People high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments i e via the \n central route to persuasion \n whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on \n peripheral cues \n such as how attractive or credible a speaker is People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition \n Psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests where research participants answered a series of statements such as \"I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve\" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests \n Research has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates \n College students high in NFC report higher \n life satisfaction \n A study on \n lucid dreaming \n found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than non-lucid dreamers \n This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles Researchers have argued that this is because self-reflectiveness or self-focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition \n Relationship to intelligence \n A number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with \n fluid intelligence \n reasoning ability particularly verbal and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning and a weaker correlation with \n crystallised intelligence \n knowledge which had much smaller positive correlations \n Dual-system theory \n NFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called \n cognitive-experiential self-theory \n The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems a rational system and an experiential system The rational system is thought to be logical verbal and relatively unemotional The experiential system is thought to be intuitive based on images and highly reliant on emotion A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition \n Research shows that the two system are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments In fact individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions intuitions and images in an automatic way On the other hand those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions intuitions and images Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more \"rational\" than those low in this trait if their faith in intuition is also high Rather their \"irrational\" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition \n Biases and decision making \n NFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts that is heuristic biases People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought \n False memories \n High need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks In a commonly used research paradigm participants are asked to memorise a list of related words Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items e g \n chair \n if the original list contained \n table \n and \n legs \n People high in NFC are more likely to show \n false memory \n for these lures due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related but non-studied items \n Halo effects \n A bias associated with low need for cognition is the \n halo effect \n a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics e g intelligence People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target People high in NFC still show a halo effect however albeit a smaller one perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness \n Relationship with personality traits \n Related constructs \n NFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs specifically epistemic curiosity \n typical intellectual engagement \n and \n openness to ideas \n Epistemic \n curiosity \n can be defined as desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas eliminate information-gaps and solve intellectual problems \n Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman and was defined as a \"personality construct that represents an individuals aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing\" \n Openness to ideas is a facet of \n openness to experience \n associated with \"aspects of being open minded engaging in unconventional thoughts and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself\" \n Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and typical intellectual engagement \n r \n = it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct \n Further studies have found that NFC typical intellectual engagement epistemic curiosity and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated \n Factor analysis \n showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis \n The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack \n discriminant validity \n they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others \n A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits \n For example NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with \n novelty \n and \n experience seeking \n than NFC \n Other personality characteristics \n Within the \n Big Five \n model of personality NFC has been found to relate positively to \n openness to experience \n most strongly and to a more moderate extent to \n conscientiousness \n particularly the competence and achievement striving facets and to relate inversely to an extent to \n neuroticism \n Regarding \n Cloninger \n 's temperament traits NFC has been related negatively to \n harm avoidance \n and positively to \n persistence \n and was unrelated to \n reward dependence \n or \n novelty seeking \n NFC has only a weak positive relationship with \n sensation seeking \n specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales \n NFC has a modest inverse correlation with \n negative affect \n NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity interest and alertness \n NFC has been positively related to other theoretically unrelated personality characteristics such as \n self-esteem \n masculine sex-role attitudes and \n absorption \n NFC is negatively related to \n social anxiety \n more strongly in females than males \n It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery and hence greater self-esteem although it is also possible that higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking \n NFC may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality \n Regarding absorption people high in NFC may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks \n Regarding social anxiety it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation \n Consumers \n Research has shown that high-need for cognition consumers prefer advertising that features open-ended comparative advertising which allows consumers to decide which brand is best \n NFC has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs Martin Sherrard and Wentzel demonstrate that high-need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity more in-depth information and low visual complexity static images rather than animations \n

only agreement and compliance \" \n In his later research McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation the need for \n socialized power \n expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans self-doubts mixed outcomes and concern for others and the need for \n personal power \n expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it \n Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative more assertive in group discussions and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation \n They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others and to engage in \n conspicuous consumption \n Pros and cons \n For individuals \n A high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace \n McClelland's own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions In one characteristic example a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management He experienced difficulty giving direct orders leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well \n Outside of work a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility a high nPow score predicts higher rates of \n externalizing \n self-destructive \n behavior such as binge-drinking and physical aggression Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce separate or physically abuse their spouses However this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles \n For society \n As with individual outcomes whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual's other traits particularly responsibility and empathy An argumentative group member may prevent \n groupthink \n or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates Even dangerous behaviors like impulsive risk-taking can be beneficial in moderation successful stock traders \n and entrepreneurs \n often have a high propensity for risk \n Gender \n On average men report a higher need for power than women which may be due to biological factors social factors or an interaction between them Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed men are more likely to express anger directly use physical violence to establish control or engage in risky or impulsive behavior while women are more likely to employ \n relational aggression \n or suppress their hostility \n When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts but an equal desire for personal power Interestingly men but not women reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power \n Other parts of the theory \n Need for achievement \n Need for achievement \n Murray defined \n need for achievement \n as the attempt to overcome obstacles Need for achievement nAch was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures Based on his/her story McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived \n Need for affiliation \n Need for affiliation \n Murray believed \n need for affiliation \n was a trait that was very strong in most people especially in stressful situations Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present In McClelland's research he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them \n Will to power"},

{"theme.id": 2, "title": "Need for affiliation", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_affiliation", "depth": 1, "text": "Need for affiliation \n The \n need for affiliation \n N-Affil \n is a term that was popularized by \n David McClelland \n and describes a person's \n need \n to feel a sense of involvement and \"belonging\" within a \n social group \n McClellend's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of \n Henry Murray \n who first identified underlying psychological human needs and \n motivational \n processes It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs including achievement \n power \n and affiliationand placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model People with a high need for affiliation require warm \n interpersonal relationships \n and approval from those with whom they have regular contact Having a strong bond with others make a person feel as if they are a part of something important that creates a powerful impact People who place high emphasis on affiliation tend to be supportive team members but may be less effective in \n leadership positions \n A person who takes part in a group whether it be a movement or project create a push towards a sense of achievement and satisfaction for the individual and the whole \n Definition \n Situations \n Definition \n Affiliation is a positive sometimes intimate personal relationship \n Affiliation can include \"concern over establishing maintaining or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person or persons\" \n Situations \n There are many situations in which people feel a need for affiliation For example in a business setting when creating a new product there can be many different ideas on how to market the product A recently hired employee might feel a need for affiliation to have their idea heard because they feel this is the best course of action If that person's idea is a success then that individual will feel a sense of achievement Thus being new the employee he decides to involve himself so he feels a sense of belonging to the rest of the employees One situation that causes a greater need for affiliation is during a stressful situation An example where there was an increase in the need for affiliation among individuals was right after the \n September terrorist attack \n on the \n World Trade Center \n This event led to Americans' putting their differences aside and coming together The increase in an individual's need for affiliation allowed individuals responding to the same \n stressor \n to come together and find security in one another Situations that include \n fear \n often lead people to want to be together and trigger a need for affiliation \n Research done by Schachter shows that fear that comes from anxiety increases the need for the person to affiliate with others who are going through the same situation or that could help them through the stressful event \n The strength of this need changes from one person to the next there are moments that people just want to be together \n The need for affiliation for an individual can vary over short amounts of time there are times when individuals wish to be with others and other times to be alone In one study completed by Shawn O'Connor and Lorne Rosenblood \n beepers \n were distributed to the students The students were then asked to record when their beepers went off whether or not they wanted to be alone or if they wanted to be with others at that particular moment This study was done to observe how frequently college students were in the presence of others and how frequently they were alone The next step in this study asked for the students to record whether at the time their beeper went off they wanted to be alone or in the company of others This response that they gave usually reflected which of the two situations they were experiencing the next time their beepers went off The information retained from this study helped to show the strength of an individual's need for affiliation \n By showing how frequently they obtained the presence of others when they felt that it was what they wanted at that moment it showed how strong their need for affiliation was at that particular moment \n Depending on the specific circumstances an individual's level of need for affiliation can become increased or decreased Yacov Rofe suggested that the need for affiliation depended on whether being with others would be useful for the situation or not When the presence of other people was seen as being helpful in relieving an individual from some of the negative aspects of the stressor an individual's desire to affiliate increases However if being with others may increase the negative aspects such as adding the possibility of embarrassment to the already present stressor the individual's desire to affiliate with others decreases \n Individuals are motivated to find and create a specific amount of social interactions Each individual desires a different amount of a need for affiliation and they desire an optimal balance of time to their self and time spent with others \n Affection \n Need theory \n

African murder trials \n Laws \n Notable examples \n Kitty Genovese \n Raymond Zack \n Wang Yue \n Reversal of bystander effect \n Role of public self-awareness \n Experiments \n Social psychology research \n The bystander effect was first demonstrated in the laboratory by \n John M Darley \n and \n Bibb Latan \n in after they became interested in the topic following the \n murder of Kitty Genovese \n in \n These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most \n replicable \n effects in \n social psychology \n In a typical experiment the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates An emergency situation is \n staged \n and researchers \n measure \n how long it takes the participants to intervene if they intervene These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping often by a large margin \n For example Bibb Latan and Judith Rodin staged an experiment around a woman in distress percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt but when there were other people in the room only percent offered help \n Variables affecting bystanders \n Emergency versus non-emergency situations \n Latan and Darley performed three experiments to test bystander behavior in non- \n emergency \n situations \n Their results indicated that the way in which the subjects were asked for help mattered In one condition subjects asked a bystander for his or her name More people provided an answer when the students gave their name first In another condition the students asked bystanders for a dime When the student gave an explanation such as saying that their wallet had been stolen the percentage of people giving assistance was higher 72% than when the student just asked for a dime 34% Additional research by Faul Mark et al using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation \n According to Latan and Darley there are five characteristics of emergencies that affect bystanders \n Emergencies involve threat of harm or actual harm \n Emergencies are unusual and rare \n The type of action required in an emergency differs from situation to situation \n Emergencies cannot be predicted or expected \n Emergencies require immediate action \n Due to these five characteristics bystanders go through cognitive and behavioural processes \n Notice \n that something is going on \n Interpret \n the situation as being an emergency \n Degree of responsibility \n felt \n Form of assistance \n Implement the action choice \n Notice \n To test the concept of \"noticing \" Latane and Darley staged an emergency using Columbia University students The students were placed in a roomeither alone with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return While they were completing the questionnaire smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately within seconds However students that were working in groups took longer up to seconds to notice the smoke Latan and Darley claimed this phenomenon could be explained by the social norm of what is considered polite etiquette in public In most western cultures politeness dictates that it is inappropriate to idly look around This may indicate that a person is nosy or rude As a result passers-by are more likely to be keeping their attention to themselves when around large groups than when alone People who are alone are more likely to be conscious of their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice a person in need of assistance \n Interpret \n Once a situation has been noticed a bystander may be encouraged to intervene if they interpret the incident as an emergency According to the principle of \n social influence \n bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think that it is necessary to intervene If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene This is an example of \n pluralistic ignorance \n or \n social proof \n Referring to the smoke experiment even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision irritating their eyes or causing them to cough they were still unlikely to report it Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes and by the end of the experiment no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all In the groups that did not report the smoke the interpretations of its cause and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause but some preferring less serious explanations such as the air-conditioner was leaking \n Similarly interpretations of the context played an important role in people's reactions to a man and woman fighting in the street When the woman yelled \"Get away from me I don't know you \" bystanders intervened percent of the time but only percent of the time when the woman yelled \"Get away from me I don't know why I ever married you \" \n General bystander effect research was mainly conducted in the context of non-dangerous non-violent emergencies A study tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if they would get the same results from other studies testing non-emergencies In situations with low potential danger significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person However in situations with high potential danger participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim \n This suggests that in situations of greater seriousness it is more likely that people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene \n Degree of Responsibility \n Darley and Latan determined that the degree of responsibility a bystander feels is dependent on three things \n Whether or not they feel the person is deserving of help \n The competence of the bystander \n The relationship between the bystander and the victim \n Forms of Assistance \n There are two categories of assistance as defined by Latan and Darley \n Direct intervention directly assisting the victim \n Detour \n intervention Detour intervention refers to reporting an emergency to the authorities i e the police fire department \n Implementation \n After going through steps 1-4 the bystander must implement the action of choice \n In one study done by Abraham S Ross the effects of increased responsibility on bystander intervention were studied by increasing the presence of children This study was based on the reaction of male undergraduates presented with emergency situations The prediction was that the intervention would be at its peak due to presence of children around those male undergraduate participants This was experimented and showed that the prediction was not supported and was concluded as \"the type of study did not result in significant differences in intervention \" \n A meta-analysis of the bystander effect \n reported that \"The bystander effect was attenuated when situations were perceived as dangerous compared with non-dangerous perpetrators were present compared with non-present and the costs of intervention were physical compared with non-physical This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping \" They also \"identified situations where bystanders provide welcome physical support for the potentially intervening individual and thus reduce the bystander effect such as when the bystanders were exclusively male when they were naive rather than passive confederates or only virtually present persons and when the bystanders were not strangers \" \n An alternative explanation has been proposed by \n Stanley Milgram \n who hypothesized that the bystanders callous behavior was caused by the strategies they had adopted in daily life to cope with \n information overload \n This idea has been supported to varying degrees by empirical research \n Timothy Hart and Ternace Miethe used data from the National Crime Victimization Survey NCVS and found that a bystander was present in percent of the violent \n victimizations \n in the data Their presence was most common in cases of physical assaults 68% which accounted for the majority of these violent victimizations and less likely in \n robberies \n 49% and \n sexual assaults \n 28% The actions of bystanders were most frequently judged by victims as \"neither helping nor hurting\" 48% followed by \"helping\" 37% \"hurting\" 10% and \"both helping and hurting\" 3% Half of the attacks in which a bystander was present occurred in the evening where the victim and bystander were strangers \n Ambiguity and consequences \n Ambiguity is one factor that affects whether or not a person assists another in need In some cases of high ambiguity it can take a person or group up to times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity In these cases bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding Bystanders are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity significant consequence situations \n Understanding of environment \n Whether or not a bystander intervenes may have to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs If the bystander is familiar with the environment they are more likely to know where to get help where the exits are etc \n Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are not familiar with the surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation \n Priming the bystander effect \n Research done by Garcia et al indicate that priming a social context may inhibit helping behavior \n Imagining being around one other person or being around a group of people can affect a person's willingness to help \n Cohesiveness and group membership \n Group cohesiveness \n Group cohesiveness is another variable that can affect the helping behaviour of a bystander As defined by Rutkowski et al cohesiveness refers to an established relationship friends acquaintances between two or more people \n Experiments have been done to test the performance of bystanders when they are in groups with people they have been acquainted with According to Rutkowski et al the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior The norm of social responsibility states that \"people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it \" As suggested by the research the more cohesive a group the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm To test this hypothesis researchers used undergraduate students and divided them into four groups a low cohesive group with two people a low cohesive group with four people a high cohesive group with two people and a high cohesive group with four people Students in the high cohesive group were then acquainted with each other by introducing themselves and discussing what they liked/disliked about school and other similar topics The point of the experiment was to determine whether or not high cohesive groups were more willing to help a hurt \"victim\" than the low cohesive groups The four member high cohesive groups were the quickest and most likely groups to respond to the victim who they believed to be hurt The four member low cohesive groups were the slowest and least likely to respond to the victim \n Altruism \n research suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped Recent research has considered the role of similarity and more specifically shared group membership in encouraging bystander intervention In one experiment researchers found that bystanders were more likely to help an injured person if that person was wearing a football jersey of a team the bystander liked as opposed to a team the bystander did not like However when their shared identity as football fans was made salient supporters of both teams were likely to be helped significantly more so than a person wearing a plain shirt \n The findings of Mark Levine and Simon Crowther illustrated that increasing group size inhibited intervention in a street violence scenario when bystanders were strangers but encouraged intervention when bystanders were friends They also found that when gender identity is salient group size encouraged intervention when bystanders and victims shared social category membership In addition group size interacted with context-specific norms that both inhibit and encourage helping The bystander effect is not a generic consequence of increasing group size When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships group size can encourage as well as inhibit helping \n These findings can be explained in terms of self-categorization and \n empathy \n From the perspective of \n self-categorization theory \n a persons own social identity well-being is tied to their group membership so that when a group based identity is salient the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group Because of this shared identity referred to as \n self-other merging \n bystanders are able to empathize which has been found to predict helping behaviour For example in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification and empathy were found to predict helping However when social identification was controlled for empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour \n Cultural differences \n In discussing the \n case of Wang Yue \n and a later incident in \n China \n in which \n CCTV footage \n from a \n Shanghai \n subway \n showed passengers fleeing from a foreigner who fainted \n UCLA \n anthropologist Yunxiang Yan asserted that the reactions can be explained by deeply seated historical cultural differences in Chinese \n agrarian society \n in which there was a stark contrast between how individuals associated with \n ingroup and outgroup \n members saying \"How to treat strangers nicely is one of the biggest challenges in contemporary Chinese society The prevailing ethical system in traditional China is based on close-knit community ties kinship ties \" He continued \"A person might treat other people in the person's social group very very nicely But turn around when facing to a stranger and a person might tend to be very suspicious And whenever possible might take advantage of that stranger \" \n Diffusion of responsibility \n Diffusion of responsibility \n Darley and Latan conducted research on diffusion of responsibility \n The findings suggest that in the case of an emergency when people believe that there are other people around they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help such as \n doctors \n or \n police officers \n and that their intervention would be unneeded They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper offering unwanted assistance or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance For this reason some legislations such as \" \n Good Samaritan Laws \n \" limit \n liability \n for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency \n Organizational ombuds practitioners' research \n A study published by \n International Ombudsman Association \n in the Journal of the International Ombudsman Association suggests thatin realitythere are dozens of reasons why people do not act on the spot or come forward in the workplace when they see behavior they consider unacceptable \n The most important reasons cited for not acting were the fear of loss of important relationships in and out of the workplace and a fear of \"bad consequences \" There also were many reasons given by people who did act on the spot or come forward to authorities \n This practitioners' study suggests that the \"bystander effect\" can be studied and analyzed in a much broader fashion The broader view includes not just a what bystanders do in singular emergencies b helping strangers in need when c there are or are not other people around The reactions of bystanders can also be analyzed a when the bystanders perceive any of a wide variety of unacceptable behavior over time b they are within an organizational context and c with people whom they know The practitioners' study reported many reasons why some bystanders within organizations do not act or report unacceptable behavior The study also suggests that bystander behavior is in fact often helpful in terms of \n acting on the spot to help \n and \n reporting \n unacceptable behavior and emergencies and people in need The ombuds practitioners' study suggests that what bystanders will do in real situations is actually very complex reflecting views of the context and their managers and relevant organizational structures if any and also many personal reasons \n In support of the idea that some bystanders do indeed act responsibly \n Gerald Koocher \n and Patricia Keith Spiegel wrote a article related to an NIH-funded study which showed that informal intervention by peers and bystanders can interrupt or remedy unacceptable scientific behavior \n What Would You Do? \n John Quiones' primetime show \n What Would You Do? \n on ABC tests the bystander effect Actors are used to act out typically non-emergency situations while the cameras capture the reactions and actions of innocent bystanders Topics include cheating on a millionaire test an elderly person \n shoplifting \n racism \n and \n homophobia \n Non-computer versus computers computer mediated intervention \n Research suggests that the bystander effect may be present in \n computer-mediated communication \n situations \n Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress In the experiment online chat groups were observed One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether or not the gender of the victim mattered if the size of each chat group had any effect and if asking for a person's help by directly using their screen name would have any effect Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim Consistent with findings of Latan and Darley the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups However this effect was nonexistent when the victim Suzy or Jake asked for help from a specific person in the chat group The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was seconds The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was seconds A significant finding of the research is that intervention depends on whether or not a victim asked for help by specifying a screen name The group size effect was inhibited when the victim specifically asked a specific person for help The group size effect was not inhibited if the victim did not ask a specific person for help \n Children as bystanders \n Although most research has been conducted on adults children can be bystanders too A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress These include \n trivialisation \n dissociation \n embarrassment association busy working priority compliance with a competitive norm audience modelling and responsibility transfer \n jargon \n In a further study Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed a \n noticing that something is wrong \n i e children pay selective attention to their environment and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed b \n interpreting a need for help \n sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance c \n feeling empathy \n i e having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed children might feel sorry for an injured peer or angry about unwarranted aggression empathic anger d \n processing the school's moral frames \n Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations the definition of a good student tribe caring gender stereotypes and social-hierarchy-dependent morality e \n scanning for social status and relations \n i e students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressorsconversely lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around f \n condensing motives for action \n such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs and g \n acting \n i e all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes \n Implications of research \n South African murder trials \n In an effort to make \n South African \n courts more just in their convictions the concept of \n extenuating circumstances \n came into being \n However no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the \n justice \n system Examples include \n deindividuation \n bystander apathy and \n conformity \n In the case of \n S vs Sibisi and Others \n eight members of the \n South African Railways and Harbours Union \n were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from \n social psychology \n Social anthropologist \n Boet Kotz provided evidence for the defense as well He testified that \n African cultures \n are characterized by a \n collective consciousness \n Kotz testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals Fraser and Colman stated that \n bystander apathy \n deindividuation \n conformity \n and \n group polarization \n were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group They also used research on bystander apathy by Latan and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty \n Laws \n Some parts of the world have included laws that hold bystanders responsible when they witness an emergency \n The \n Charter of human rights and freedoms \n of \n Quebec \n states that \" e very person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril either personally or calling for aid unless it involves danger to himself or a third person or he has another valid reason\" \n It is therefore a legal obligation to assist people in danger in Quebec \n Likewise the Brazilian Penal Code states that it is a crime not to rescue or call emergency services when appropriate injured or disabled people including those found under grave and imminent danger as long as it safe to do so This also includes abandoned children \n The German penal code makes it a crime for a person to fail to render aid in cases of accidents or other common dangers unless such person would thereby endanger themselves or it would be contrary to some other important obligation \n In the US \n Good Samaritan laws \n have been implemented to protect bystanders who acted in good faith Many organizations are including bystander training For example the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues Others have been doing bystander training with respect to diversity issues \n Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program \n and the Green Dot program \n Others have been critical of these laws for being punitive and criminalizing the problem they are meant to address \n Many institutions have worked to provide options for bystanders who see behavior they find unacceptable These options are usually provided through \n complaint systems \n so bystanders have choices about where to go One option that is particularly helpful is that of an \n organizational ombudsman \n who keeps no records for the employer and is near-absolutely confidential \n Notable examples \n Kitty Genovese \n Murder of Kitty Genovese \n The \n case of Kitty Genovese \n is often cited and occasionally criticized as an example of the \"bystander effect\" It is also the case that originally stimulated social psychological research in this area On March Genovese years old was on her way back to her apartment in Queens New York from work at 3am when she was stabbed sexually assaulted and murdered in front of multiple witnesses \n According to newspaper accounts the attack lasted for at least a half an hour during which time Genovese screamed and pleaded for help The murderer attacked Genovese and stabbed her then fled the scene after attracting the attention of a neighbor The killer then returned ten minutes later and finished the assault Newspaper reports after Genovese's death claimed that witnesses watched the stabbings and failed to intervene or even contact the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died This led to widespread public attention and many editorials Psychology researchers Latan and Darley attributed the lack of help by witnesses to \n diffusion of responsibility \n because each witness saw others witnessing the same event they assumed that the others would be taking responsibility and calling the police and therefore did nothing to stop the situation themselves \n According to an article published in \n American Psychologist \n in the original story of Genovese's murder was exaggerated by the media Specifically there were not eyewitnesses the police were contacted at least once during the attack and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event The authors of the article suggest that the story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a \n parable \n and serves as a dramatic example for students \n Raymond Zack \n Death of Raymond Zack \n On \n Memorial Day \n 53-year-old Raymond Zack of \n Alameda California \n walked into the waters off Robert Crown Memorial Beach and stood neck deep in water roughly yards offshore for almost an hour His foster mother Dolores Berry called 9-1-1 and said that he was trying to drown himself There are conflicting reports about Zack's intentions \n Firefighters and police responded but did not enter the water The firefighters called for a United States Coast Guard boat to respond to the scene According to police reports Alameda police expected the firefighters to enter the water \n Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue Dozens of civilians on the beach and watching from their homes across from the beach did not enter the water apparently expecting public safety officers to conduct a rescue Eventually Zack collapsed in the water apparently from hypothermia Even then nobody entered the water for several minutes Finally a \n good samaritan \n entered the water and pulled Zack to shore Zack died afterwards at a local hospital \n Wang Yue \n Death of Wang Yue \n In October a 2-year-old girl Wang Yue was hit by a small white van in the city of \n Foshan \n China then run over by a large truck when she was not moved by bystanders A total of people ignored her some going so far as to walk around the blood The girl was left for seven minutes before a recycler Chen Xianmei picked up the toddler and called for help The child died eight days later \n Reversal of bystander effect \n Role of public self-awareness \n In many cases we believe that individuals like to view themselves as noble by offering help This concept is related to the notion of self-awareness If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other However being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness In fact in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous According to Dr van Bommel by introducing an accountability cue the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help \n Experiments \n To investigate if people would help others in the presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue van Bommel \n set out to perform two experiments For the first experiment participants were invited to join an online forum A sample of students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of the other people that were online in the left upper half of the screen To operationalize the accountability cue participants' names were displayed in either red or black Red salient condition utilized to attract attention and stand out was used to raise public self-awareness while black non-salient was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders In random order five different messages were presented to the participants Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected the results showed that names in black non-salient condition were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being However when names were in the red salient condition the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect \n In order to further investigate the reversal of the bystander effect van Bommel performed a second experiment also reported in the article with a sample size of students Unlike the first study they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum Therefore the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum The procedure was identical to the first study with a few variations To induce public awareness in this study webcams were mounted on participants computers Participants could not see the video feed but to make this more salient they asked participants before they started to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible they asked participants in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on Similar to the first experiment five different messages were presented to the participants and the number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants Once again the results were as expected When the camera was not present the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being However when a camera was present the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to That said the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in the bystander effect \n Belief perseverance \n Bystander Revolution \n Diffusion of responsibility \n Duty to rescue \n Empathy-altruism hypothesis \n Somebody else's problem \n \"The Finale\" \n

behavior For imitation to gain approval see \n normative social influence \n Social proof \n also known as \n informational social influence \n is a \n psychological \n and \n social \n phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior in a given situation \n Social proof is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate \n mode of behavior \n and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation \n The effects of \n social influence \n can be seen in the tendency of large groups to conform to choices which are either correct or mistaken This is referred to in some publications as the \n herd behavior \n Although social proof reflects a rational motive to take into account the information possessed by others and formal analysis that shows it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single distinct choice so that decisions of even larger groups of individuals may be grounded in very little information see \n information cascades \n Social proof is one type of \n conformity \n When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behavior When \"we conform because we believe that others' interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action\" \n it is informational social influence This is contrasted with \n normative social influence \n wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others \n Social proof often leads not only to public \n compliance \n conforming to the behavior of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct but also private acceptance conforming out of a genuine belief that others are correct \n Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more important and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable \n Mechanisms \n Multiple source effect \n Uncertainty about the correct conclusion \n Similarity to the surrounding group \n Research \n Early research \n Cultural effects on social proof \n Copycat suicides \n Examples \n In employment \n In entertainment \n In social media \n The environment \n Modifiers \n Possession of special knowledge \n Identification with authority \n \"Smart money\" \n Mechanisms \n Multiple source effect \n The multiple source effect occurs when people give more credence to ideas that are stated by multiple sources This effect can be clearly seen when social proof occurs For instance one study observed that people who hear five positive reviews on a book as read by five different synthesized voices perceive that book more favourably than if they hear the same five reviews as read by one synthesized voice \n Uncertainty about the correct conclusion \n Uncertainty is a major factor that encourages the use of social proof One study found that when evaluating a product consumers were more likely to incorporate the opinions of others through the use of social proof when their own experiences with the product were ambiguous leaving uncertainty as to the correct conclusion that they should make \n Similarity to the surrounding group \n Similarity also motivates the use of social proof when a person perceives themselves as similar to the people around them they are more likely to adopt and perceive as correct the observed behavior of these people This has been noted in areas such as the use of \n laugh tracks \n where participants will laugh longer and harder when they perceive the people laughing to be similar to themselves \n Social proof is also one of \n Robert Cialdini's \n six principles of persuasion along with reciprocity commitment/consistency authority liking and scarcity which maintains that people are especially likely to perform certain actions if they can relate to the people who performed the same actions before them \n One experiment which exemplifies this claim was conducted by researchers who joined a door-to-door charity campaign who found that if a list of prior donators was longer the next person solicited was more likely to donate as well This trend was even more pronounced when the names on the donor list were people that the prospective donor knew such as friends and neighbors \n Cialdini's principle also asserts that peer power is effective because people are more likely respond to influence tactics applied horizontally rather than vertically so people are more likely to be persuaded by a colleague than a superior \n Research \n Early research \n The most famous study of social proof is \n Muzafer Sherif's \n experiment \n In this experiment subjects were placed in a dark room and asked to look at a dot of light about feet away They were then asked how much in inches the dot of light was moving In reality it was not moving at all but due to the \n autokinetic effect \n it appeared to move How much the light appears to move varies from person to person but is generally consistent over time for each individual A few days later a second part of the experiment was conducted Each subject was paired with two other subjects and asked to give their estimate of how much the light was moving out loud Even though the subjects had previously given different estimates the groups would come to a common estimate To rule out the possibility that the subjects were simply giving the group answer to avoid looking foolish while still believing their original estimate was correct Sherif had the subjects judge the lights again by themselves after doing so in the group They maintained the group's judgment Because the movement of the light is ambiguous the participants were relying on each other to define reality \n Another study looked at informational social influence in \n eyewitness identification \n Subjects were shown a slide of the \"perpetrator\" They were then shown a slide of a line-up of four men one of whom was the perpetrator they had seen and were asked to pick him out The task was made difficult to the point of ambiguity by presenting the slides very quickly The task was done in a group that consisted of one actual subject and three confederates a person acting as a subject but actually working for the experimenter The confederates answered first and all three gave the same wrong answer In a high-importance condition of the experiment subjects were told that they were participating in a real test of eyewitness identification ability that would be used by police departments and courts and their scores would establish the norm for performance In a low-importance condition subjects were told that the slide task was still being developed and that the experimenters had no idea what the norm for performance wasthey were just looking for useful hints to improve the task It was found that when subjects thought the task was of high importance they were more likely to conform giving the confederate's wrong answer 51% of the time as opposed to 35% of the time in the low-importance condition \n Cultural effects on social proof \n The strength of social proof also varies across different cultures For instance studies have shown that subjects in collectivist cultures conform to others' social proof more often than those in individualist cultures \n Although this trend seems reoccurring there is evidence which suggests that these results are a simplification and that an independent subject's personal individualistic-collectivist tendency also makes an impact upon their decisions \n Additional variables such as the subject's sense of social responsibility need to be taken into account to better understand the mechanisms of social proof across cultures for example more collectivist individuals will often have an increased compulsion to help others because of their prominent awareness of social responsibility and this in turn will increase the likelihood they will comply to requests regardless of their peers' previous decisions \n Copycat suicides \n Further information \n Copycat suicide Social proof model \n Social proof has been proposed as an explanation for \n copycat suicide \n where suicide rates increase following media publication about suicides \n One study using \n agent-based modeling \n showed that copycat suicides are more likely when there are similarities between the person involved in the publicized suicide and the potential copycats \n In addition research performed by David Phillips between and further supports the existence of copycat suicides \n Examples \n In employment \n A person who has been \n unemployed \n for a long time may have a hard time finding a new jobeven if they are highly skilled and qualified Potential employers attribute wrongly the person's lack of employment to the person rather than the situation This causes the potential employers to search more intensively for flaws or other negative characteristics that are \"congruent\" with or explain the person's failure and to discount the applicant's virtues \n Similarly a person who is in high demandfor example a \n CEO \n may continue to get many attractive job offers and can as a result extract a considerable wage premiumeven if his/her objective performance has been poor When people appear successful potential employers and others who evaluate them tend to search more intensively for virtues or positive characteristics that are \"congruent\" with or explain the person's success and to ignore or underestimate the person's faults People who experience positive social proof may also benefit from a \n halo effect \n Other attributes are deemed to be more positive than they actually are Additionally the person's attributes may be viewed with a positive \n framing \n bias For example a person might be viewed as arrogant if they have negative social proof and bold if they have positive social proof For these reasons social proof is important in determining a potential employer's \n consideration set \n Social proof naturally also applies to products and is used extensively in marketing and sales \n Situations that violate social proof can cause \n cognitive dissonance \n and can cause people to have a sense of loss of control or failure of the \" \n just world hypothesis \n \" \n In entertainment \n Theaters sometimes use \n specially planted audience members \n who are instructed to give ovations at pre-arranged times Usually these people are the ones who clap initially and the rest of the audience follows Such ovations may be perceived by non-expert audience members as signals of the performance's quality \n Contrary to common annoyance of \n canned laughter \n in television shows television studios have discovered that they can increase the perceived \"funniness\" of a show by merely playing canned laughter at key \"funny\" moments They have found that even though viewers find canned laughter highly annoying they perceive shows that happen to use canned laughter more funny than the shows that do not use canned laughter \n In social media \n Social proof is also prominent on social networks such as Twitter Facebook Instagram and YouTube The number of followers fans views likes favorites and even comments that a user has made positively affects how other users perceive them A user on Twitter with a million followers is perceived as more trustworthy and reputable than a similar user with a thousand followers resulting in faster growth of followers and higher engagement and click-through-rates \n Although these fake followers will never help meet business objectives or generate sales directly \n An entire multimillion-dollar industry known as \n ghost followers \n exist for the sole purpose of increasing social proof on social media \n The environment \n Social norms are often not clearly articulated for sustainable or pro-environmental conduct \n A good example is the consumption of bottled water Many people are generally unaware of the negative environmental consequences associated with the production and consumption of bottled water A recent study by van der Linden \n uses the 'informational social influence' hypothesis to illustrate that people are more likely to reduce their consumption of bottled water when simple information on negative impacts is preceded by 'social proof' that referent others have already started to behave pro-environmentally as well i e illustrating the appropriate social norm \n Modifiers \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this section \n by \n adding

During the 20th century however the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries representing the intentional dissemination of often false but certainly \"compelling\" claims to

World War I by the \n Creel Committee \n in the United States and the \n Ministry of Information \n in Britain Writing in Lasswell observed \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends The outcry in the United States against Mr Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information or 'Inflammation' helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council ' 'specialist in public education ' 'public relations adviser ' \" \n Types \n Identifying propaganda has always been a problem \n The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of \n persuasion \n and avoiding a \n biased \n approach Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions attitudes opinions and actions of specified target audiences for \n ideological \n political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages which may or may not be factual via mass and direct media channels \" \n The definition focuses on the communicative process involved or more precisely on the purpose of the process and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener \n Propaganda poster in \n North Korean \n primary school \n According to historian \n Zbynk Zeman \n propaganda is defined as either white grey or black White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins \n compare with \n black operation \n a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden In scale these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda For example opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source Opposition to grey propaganda when revealed often by an inside source may create some level of public outcry Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported \n Propaganda poster in North Korea \n The propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group Propaganda in this sense serves as a corollary to \n censorship \n in which the same purpose is achieved not by filling people's minds with approved information but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda \n Religious \n Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues particularly during the split between the \n Roman Catholic Church \n and the \n Protestant churches \n More in line with the religious roots of the term propaganda is also used widely in the debates about \n new religious movements \n NRMs both by people who defend them and by people who oppose them The latter pejoratively call these NRMs \n cults \n Anti-cult activists \n and \n Christian countercult activists \n accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them Some social scientists such as the late Jeffrey Hadden and \n CESNUR \n affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of \"cults\" and the \n anti-cult movement \n of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons \n Wartime \n A US Office for War Information poster uses \n stereotyped \n imagery to warn lazy American workers they are helping the Japanese war effort \n In postWorld War II usage of the word \"propaganda\" more typically refers to political or \n nationalist \n uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas \n Propaganda is a powerful weapon in war it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy either internal or external by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms e g the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the \n Vietnam War \n respectively avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice which may be fictitious or may be based on facts e g the sinking of the passenger ship \n RMS Lusitania \n by the German Navy in World War I The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just In NATO doctrine propaganda is defined as \"Any information ideas doctrines or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion emotions attitudes or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly \" \n Within this perspective information provided does not need to be necessarily false but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it \n Propaganda is also one of the methods used in \n psychological warfare \n which may also involve \n false flag \n operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation e g The \n Bay of Pigs \n invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes e g During the First World War the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army and women to work in the countrys industry The propaganda posters were used because radios and TVs were not very common at that time \n The assumption is that if people believe something false they will constantly be assailed by doubts Since these doubts are unpleasant see \n cognitive dissonance \n people will be eager to have them extinguished and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations \n Britannia \n arm-in-arm with \n Uncle Sam \n symbolizes the British-American alliance in World War I \n Propaganda may be administered in insidious ways For instance disparaging \n disinformation \n about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\" even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others \n In the Soviet Union during the Second World War the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic On the other hand the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing \n Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his \"majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples \" \n Article of the \n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes \n incitement \n to discrimination hostility or violence by law \n Naturally the common people don't want war neither in Russia nor in England nor in America nor for that matter in Germany That is understood But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders That is easy All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger It works the same way in any country \n Hermann Gring \n Advertising \n Propaganda shares techniques with \n advertising \n and \n public relations \n each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization person or brand \n World War I \n propaganda poster for enlistment in the \n U S Army \n Journalistic theory generally holds that news items should be objective giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand On the other hand advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light primarily meant to persuade rather than inform Normally they use only subtle \n propaganda techniques \n and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\" Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda which is misleading Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement \n Politics \n Propaganda has become more common in \n political \n contexts in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments political groups but also often covert interests In the early 20th century propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans Propaganda also has much in common with \n public information \n campaigns by governments which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior such as wearing seat belts not smoking not littering and so forth Again the emphasis is more political in propaganda Propaganda can take the form of \n leaflets \n posters TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other \n medium \n In the case of the United States there is also an important legal imposed by law distinction between advertising a type of \n overt propaganda \n and what the Government Accountability Office GAO an arm of the United States Congress refers to as \"covert propaganda\" \n Roderick Hindery argues \n that propaganda exists on the political left and right and in mainstream centrist parties Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda indoctrination and terrorism/counterterrorism He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself \n Anti-communist \n propaganda in a comic book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of \"the dangers of a Communist takeover\" \n Since \n 9/11 \n and the appearance of greater media fluidity propaganda institutions practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain \n Dr Emma Louise Briant \n shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus cross-government and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences with new efforts in \n strategic communication \n These were subject to contestation within the \n US Government \n resisted by \n Pentagon \n Public Affairs \n and critiqued by some scholars \n The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year section a amended the US Information and Educational Exchange Act of popularly referred to as the \n Smith-Mundt Act \n and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors BBG to be released within U S borders for the Archivist of the United States The Smith-Mundt Act as amended provided that the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall make available to the Archivist of the United States for domestic distribution motion pictures films videotapes and other material years after the initial dissemination of the material abroad Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication either directly or indirectly because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material or based on a presumption of such exposure Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States \n Workplace propaganda \n The ease of data collection emerging from the IT revolution and a lack of control on the acquired data's use has led to the widespread implementation of workplace propaganda created much more locally such as in schools hospitals local retail outlets and Universities \n The same article also notes a departure from the traditional methodology of propagandists i e the use of emotionally provocative imagery to distort facts Workplace propaganda is suggested to use 'distorted data' to overrule emotion For example workplace propaganda may provide rationales for ideologically driven pay cuts \n Techniques \n Further information \n Propaganda techniques \n Anti-capitalist \n propaganda \n Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports government reports historical revision \n junk science \n books leaflets \n movies \n radio television and posters Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to \n indoctrinate \n the target group This may begin with a simple transmission such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information via a web site hot line radio program etc as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement and then from information seeker to \n opinion leader \n through indoctrination \n A number of techniques based in \n social psychological \n research are used to generate propaganda Many of these same techniques can be found under \n logical fallacies \n since propagandists use arguments that while sometimes convincing are not necessarily valid \n Some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with \n propagandistic messages \n Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread \n Models \n Social psychology \n The field of \n social psychology \n includes the study of \n persuasion \n Social psychologists can be \n sociologists \n or \n psychologists \n The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion For example communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility expertise trustworthiness and attractiveness The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors e g the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them Nobel Prizewinning psychologist \n Herbert A Simon \n won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are \n cognitive misers \n That is in a society of mass information people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially as opposed to logically \n According to \n William W Biddle \n 's article \"A psychological definition of propaganda\" \" t he four principles followed in propaganda are rely on emotions never argue cast propaganda into the pattern of \"we\" versus an \"enemy\" reach groups as well as individuals hide the propagandist

{"theme.id": 2, "title": "Judge\u2013advisor system", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge%E2%80%93advisor_system", "depth": 1, "text": "Judgeadvisor system \n A \n judgeadvisor system \n JAS \n is a type of advice structure often studied in \n advice \n taking research a subset of \n decision-making \n in the social sciences The two roles in a JAS are the judge and advisor roles The judge is the decision maker who evaluates information concerning a particular decision and makes the final judgment on the decision outcome The advisor is an individual who provides advice information or suggestions to the judge \n A key component of the dynamics in a JAS is the differentiation between the two roles in that while the advisor provides input to the decision actual decision-making power resides solely with the judge This one person decision power differentiates the JAS and related models such as Hollenbeck's Hierarchical Decision-Making Team model \n from more widely studied models where the final decision is mutually decided upon by the team as a whole \n While JASs can be most easily thought of as between superiors and subordinates such as in studentadvisor or workermanager relationships differential social or power standings are not necessary All that is required is that only one individual the judge has the final say in the decision outcome all other input given to the judge may be taken under consideration but need not be acted on Therefore even a situation where a friend receives advice from a peer can be considered a JAS \n Though examples of JASs are prevalent in real world settings they are studied most frequently in laboratory experiments in which judge/advisor roles are \n randomly assigned \n and situations/variables are manipulated at a between-subjects level \n Such manipulations allow for systematic study of the factors that affect how a judge reacts and responds to advisor advice \n Advice utilization \n Antecedents to advice utilization \n Judge decision-making style \n Decision-making competence \n Trust and confidence \n Type of advice \n Task type \n Solicitation of advice \n Other factors contributing to advice utilization \n Financial \n Advisor characteristics \n Task difficulty \n Consequences of advice utilization \n Accuracy of judge's final decision \n Judge's confidence in final decision \n Applications \n Future research directions \n Advice utilization \n Advice utilization is the degree to which judges take advisor advice into consideration in their final decision outcome and advice discounting is any effect that lowers the degree of advice utilization Both of these terms are frequently used interchangeably in JAS literature as they are related in opposition to one another i e advice discounting is a lack of advice utilization The amount of utilization is one of the most considered outcomes of a JAS decision process and depends on all the types of inputs described below In addition to these inputs there are theories for other sources of advice discounting in decision-making literature three of the most dominant theories are differential information \n anchoring \n and \n egocentric bias \n The differential information theory proposes that advice discounting stems from the fact that unlike with peoples own opinions they are not aware of advisors internal reasons for their opinions and so are less apt to fully accept them \n The second theory \n anchoring \n suggests that people use their own opinion as the starting point for their choice and only use advisor input to a certain extent that will adjust their initial position up or down \n The third theory \n egocentric bias \n proposes advice discounting happens due to judges believing they are superior to others so weigh their own opinion stronger than inputs from any other source \n In JAS literature one of the most robust advice discounting classification is egocentric advice discounting \n which draws conceptually from the basic theories of anchoring and egocentric bias Simply put egocentric advice discounting is the tendency of individuals to prefer advice and opinions that closely align to their own opinions formed prior to hearing any input Therefore judges tend to overly weigh advice from advisors that is similar to their own viewpoint regardless of what sort of expertise an advisor appears to have Conversely if the advice given is very dissimilar to the judges initial opinions that advice will be discounted much more than should be justified given the advisors level of expertise \n Antecedents to advice utilization \n Judge decision-making style \n Decision-making style refers to differences in the ways individuals approach decision tasks and respond to situations \n In a JAS judges differing styles can affect the way they accept and respond to advisor advice Five styles identified by Scott and Bruce are rational intuitive dependent spontaneous and avoidant \n Rational relying on logical evaluations and exhaustive searches for all relevant information \n Intuitive relying on intuition hunches and other intangibles \n Dependent relying on others for advice and direction \n Spontaneous relying on a strong urge to make decisions as soon as possible \n Avoidant relying on strategies for putting off the decision-making process as long as possible \n These styles are not mutually exclusive within an individual but there are discernible pattern differences across people \n While not explicitly examined in many JAS studies an understanding of these decision-making style differences can inform future understanding of advice-taking dynamics \n Decision-making competence \n Judges may differ in their susceptibility to a number of different errors in decision-making these characteristic differences are considered their specific decision-making competencies While decision-making competency has been broken down into categories in several different ways one of the most widely accepted frameworks is the Adult Decision-Making Competence scale A-DMC developed by Bruine de Bruin et al \n The A-DMC consists of categories of decision-making competencies that include dimensions such as Resistance to \n Framing \n and Recognizing \n Social Norms \n see Bruine de Bruin et al for a full description Weaknesses in these different areas make judges more susceptible to particular errors in judgment and may influence the way advisor input is received and acted upon \n Trust and confidence \n The level of trust a judge has with an advisor is directly related to the degree to which advice is taken into account When judges trust their advisors they are more likely to accept the advice given to them all other factors being equal \n Note that the trust relationship in a JAS is frequently unbalanced due to the greater importance of trust for the judge than the advisor This results because the judge must place a certain amount of trust in the advisors in order to utilize their advice in the decision which only the judge is ultimately responsible for Advisors on the other hand typically need not trust a judge in order to simply relay a suggestion or information Given this dynamic considerations of trust levels need only be made from the judges and not the advisors perspective Key influencers of JAS trust levels include perceived advisor confidence and subject expertise \n Type of advice \n The type of advice given by an advisor can influence the way it is received by the judge In a JAS the concept of advice needs to be broader than the typical definition of a recommendation for a particular outcome in a decision situation While this sort of input is certainly one kind of advice other types of advice also exist Dalal and Bonaccio suggest that there are different kinds of advice \n Recommendation for advice in favor of a particular alternative \n Recommendation against advice against one or more alternatives \n Information neutral advice giving more information about the alternatives without suggesting a particular one \n Decision Support no specific outcome advice instead input or support to guide the judges decision-making process \n Judges react to these four types of advice with differential preferences While specifics of the particular type of decision task and the judges individual differences can affect the degree of preference between types initial research shows Information-type advice to be most preferred \n This sort of advice has been little recognized in much of the past advice-taking literature and is expected to receive more attention in the future \n Task type \n Difficulty of the decision task influences the extent judges rely on advisor inputs When a difficult task is given to a judge there is a tendency to over-rely on the advice received from advisors conversely judges tend to rely less than they should on advisor information when the task seems relatively easy \n For example if judges need to make a decision about which stocks will be best performers based on complex financial data they are given they will be likely to defer to the advice of their advisors regardless of their supposed expertise since the judge's own grasp of the situation is so low However if the decision task seems more straightforward or simple to the judges they will be far likelier to weigh their own opinions more heavily than their advisors inputs regardless of the states of expertise the advisors have \n While the most often used decision tasks in JAS literature are ones that involve picking the right or best option an entirely different kind of decision to consider is one involving a choice based on taste or preference These situations come up frequently in life and are part of almost every consumer decision about the kind of music to buy clothes to wear or restaurants to visit Though less explored in JAS literature Yaniv et al provided evidence that in these situations of preference similarity of the advisor to the judge is the strongest predictor of how much the judge will accept the advice \n This similarity can be either in regard to a previous history of the advisor having similar preferences in a given category e g they rate the same kinds of songs highly or relating to basic demographic characteristics e g they are around the same age \n Solicitation of advice \n Advice from an advisor can be either solicited the judge seeks out input or unsolicited input is given automatically without being requested The degree of advice utilization has been shown to be influenced by which of these two situations is true for the decision situation at hand As may be expected by conventional wisdom advice utilization is typically higher for solicited versus unsolicited advice \n When people seek out advice it is implied that they are open to considering opinions other than their own and prone to higher advice utilization Conversely unsolicited advice can be seen as intrusive or as a type of criticism from the advisor about the judges competency \n Other factors contributing to advice utilization \n Financial \n Several characteristics of the decision task or judgeadvisor relationship have been shown to decrease the effect of egocentric discounting First if there is a financial incentive for making the correct or best decision judges tend to rely more heavily on their advisors \n Similarly when judges must pay for advice that input is taken much more into account than when it is freely given \n The effect of paying for advice is thought to have foundations in the economic theory of \n sunk costs \n Advisor characteristics \n In situations where the judges perceive the advisors to have expert knowledge the advice received is taken into account more regardless of similarity to the judges own opinions \n This finding is intuitive the less someone knows about a situation in relationship to their advisor the more likely they are to take that persons advice into account Advisor characteristics commonly associated with superior knowledge such as being older more educated or more experienced also have been shown to decrease egocentric discounting in decision-making situations \n Task difficulty \n Beyond advisor characteristics and financial factors the nature of the decision task itself can influence the degree to which advice is accepted In relatively easy tasks judges tend to consider advisor input to a lesser degree than they should based on the known expertise of the advisor Similarly when presented with a very difficult task judges tend to over-rely on the advisor inputs \n This dynamic is important to keep in mind when trying to identify real-world situations where people are vulnerable to being extremely influenced by people posing as experts \n Consequences of advice utilization \n Accuracy of judge's final decision \n Decision-making outcomes in a JAS or other advice-giving structures have been widely shown to be more accurate than those from situations with isolated decision makers \n This result should be expected given that advice situations often allow judges access to knowledge above and beyond what they could have as an individual When judges have access to multiple advisors with different information sources their decision accuracy improves even more \n A potential reason for this is due to the averaging across advisors that the judge does when integrating the different pieces of advice Like in \n forecasting \n the individual variations between advice become less pronounced and judges are left with more definitive advice that has the strength of consensus behind it \n Judge's confidence in final decision \n There are several key aspects of the JAS system that influence the degree to which the judge has confidence in his decision being accurate or correct The amount of agreement between advisors has been shown to affect judges' confidence in their decision such that higher disagreement between advisors is associated with low confidence \n Another factor that has demonstrated influence over judge confidence is the amount of effort the judge must put forth to understand and react to the advice proffered by the advisors As effort to process and comprehend advice increases so does a judge's overall confidence in their final decision \n Lastly it was found that judges could actually become overconfident in their decisions when having to rely almost completely on advisor recommendations due to not possessing nearly enough task-specific information themselves \n Applications \n Examples of judgeadvisor systems can be found in many real-world situations A recent example of an important JAS situation was that of the controversy around the federal loan guarantees to the now-bankrupt \n Solyndra \n In this situation as in many other situations that reach the presidential office there are many sources of diverse advice that the president and other decision-makers receive For example both the director of the National Economic Council and the Treasury secretary advised the president that they believed the selection guidelines were not thorough enough and might allow for funding of unnecessary risky companies However the Energy Secretary under pressure from congress advised the president to actually speed up loans and decrease scrutiny on the selection process As demonstrated by several studies advisors with differing viewpoints and differing degrees of unique information can interact with decision-makers in complex and sometimes detrimental ways \n The decision-makers are then in the difficult position of aggregating all this advice and making the most informed policy decision As with the Solyndra controversy these decisions can sometimes fall under great scrutiny and not produce the most effective solution \n JAS situations can also arise in more common settings that typical individuals can experience A very common JAS arises when individuals receive advice from doctors and other medical professionals For example an individual with diabetes might receive specific advice about better controlling their blood sugar after a situation that required that they go to the hospital That individual then may seek second opinions about that advice before coming to a decision regarding whether or not they will change their behavior to fit more with those recommendations As is found in the JAS research people often do not fully utilize doctors' recommendations often to their own detriment \n In each of these situations being able to figure out the way to make the advice system most efficient and productive has clear benefits Understanding the most effective ways to give advice has great potential in training programs for advisors mentors and in management training as a whole An example of such application is seen in the work by Wilkins et al on the development of the Raven and CoRaven decision-making aids used by the military to filter and represent massive amounts of battlefield data for strategic planning \n Using principles derived from JAS research the authors were able to analyze and better understand the aids with the result being a more effective system that makes battlefield decision-making less of a risky process In this situation the researchers treated the intelligent software as an advisor and the commanding officer as the judge Under this assumption the researchers then applied past and current JAS research findings to critically evaluate the software with the hopes of improving its functionality This utilization of JAS research is an example of one of the most promising and direct applications of the paradigm- \n collaborative technology \n which can facilitate decision-making processes that are too complex for human cognition alone \n Judge advisor systems research can also be applied to business finance education and many other fields in which hierarchical group-decision making is common Applications of such research could be used to make time-sensitive decisions in high-impact situations such as emergency rooms more efficient and accurate potentially saving the lives of patients in need The JAS framework could be effectively applied in public affairs to increase the speed at which new policies are created and enacted Other direct and indirect applications are possible for virtually every situation in which hierarchical group decision-making exists \n Future research directions \n JAS research is still a developing field with growth needed in a couple key areas One area of interest is a deeper understanding about the motives of decision-makers in JAS situations beyond decision accuracy and autonomy \n In the real world decision-makers frequently have many motives beyond making the most accurate and informed decision often due to social influences Some additional motives that have already been cited include attempting to diffuse responsibility for a decision \n minimizing the amount of effort on behalf of the decision-maker \n and maintaining good rapport with the advisor s \n As mentioned previously a less-explored subject matter that has surfaced in the JAS literature pertains to decisions regarding matters of taste \n Due to the relative newness of this work there is ample opportunity for further research New questions raised by this research include the effect of \n normative influences \n on taste preferences and hot-cold \n empathy gaps \n i e individuals preference for a certain food in a not hungry versus hungry state \n Finally one major topic that has been cited as needing further study is extending the context of decision-making beyond what has already been observed to see how these contexts affect the JAS \n This research area is related to concerns about the generalizability of many JAS studies to real-world decision-making situations in other words that the stimuli in controlled lab settings are impoverished compared to the stimuli individuals experience in their own lives \n Thus there has been a call for research that replicates previous findings in a more rich situational context \n Legal advisor \n Social sciences \n Industrial and organizational psychology \n

\n subconscious \n process in which people attempt to \n influence \n the \n perceptions \n of other people about a person object or event They do so by regulating and controlling information in social interaction \n It was first conceptualized by \n Erving Goffman \n in and then was expanded upon in An example of impression management theory in play is in sports such as soccer At an important game a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible because there are college recruiters watching This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game \n Impression management is usually used synonymously with \n self \n -presentation in which a person tries to influence the perception of their image The notion of impression management was first applied to \n face-to-face communication \n but then was expanded to apply to \n computer-mediated communication \n The concept of impression management is applicable to academic fields of study such as psychology and sociology as well as practical fields such as corporate communication and media \n Background \n Theory \n Motives \n Self-presentation \n Social interaction \n Dramaturgical

Computer-mediated communication \n Corporate brand \n Corporate storytelling \n Corporate document \n Media \n Profiles on social networking sites \n Political impression management \n Implications \n Footnotes \n Background \n The foundation and the defining principles of impression management were created by Erving Goffman in \n The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life \n Impression management theory states that one tries to alter one's perception according to one's goals In other words the theory is about how individuals wish to present themselves but in a way that satisfies their needs and goals Goffman \"proposed to focus on how people in daily work situations present themselves and in so doing what they are doing to others\" and he was \"particularly interested in how a person guides and control how others form an impression of them and what a person may or may not do while performing before them\" \n Theory \n Motives \n A range of factors that govern impression management can be identified It can be stated that impression management becomes necessary whenever there exists a kind of social situation whether real or imaginary Logically the awareness of being a potential subject of monitoring is also crucial Furthermore the characteristics of a given social situation are important Specifically the surrounding \n cultural norms \n determine the appropriateness of particular nonverbal behaviours \n The actions have to be appropriate to the targets and within that culture so that the kind of audience as well as the relation to the audience influences the way impression management is realized A person's goals are another factor governing the ways and strategies of impression management This refers to the content of an assertion which also leads to distinct ways of presentation of aspects of the self The degree of self-efficacy describes whether a person is convinced that it is possible to convey the intended impression \n A new study finds that all other things being equal people are more likely to pay attention to faces that have been associated with negative gossip than those with neutral or positive associations The study contributes to a body of work showing that far from being objective human perceptions are shaped by unconscious brain processes that determine what they \"choose\" to see or ignoreeven before they become aware of it The findings also add to the idea that the brain evolved to be particularly sensitive to \"bad guys\" or cheatersfellow humans who undermine social life by deception theft or other non-cooperative behavior \n There are many methods behind self-presentation including \n self disclosure \n identifying what makes you \"you\" to another person managing appearances trying to fit in ingratiation aligning actions making one's actions seem appealing or understandable and alter-casting imposing identities on other people These self-presentation methods can also be used on the corporate level as impression management \n Self-presentation \n Self-presentation is conveying information about oneself or an image of oneself to others There are two types and motivations of self-presentation \n presentation meant to match one's own self-image and \n presentation meant to match audience expectations and preferences \n Self-presentation is expressive Individuals construct an image of themselves to claim personal identity and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image \n If they feel like it is restricted they often exhibit \n reactance \n or become defiant try to assert their freedom against those who would seek to curtail self-presentation expressiveness An example of this dynamic is the \"preacher's daughter\" whose suppressed personal identity and emotions cause an eventual backlash at her family and community \n Boasting \n Millon \n notes that in self-presentation individuals are challenged to balance boasting against discrediting themselves via excessive self-promotion or being caught and being proven wrong Individuals often have limited ability to perceive how their efforts impact their acceptance and likeability by others \n Flattery \n Flattery \n or \n praise \n to increase social attractiveness \n Intimidation \n aggressively showing \n anger \n to get others to hear and obey one's demands \n Self-presentation can be either defensive or assertive strategies Whereas defensive strategies include behaviours like avoidance of threatening situations or means of \n self-handicapping \n assertive \n strategies refer to more active behaviour like the verbal idealisation of the self the use of status symbols or similar practices \n These strategies play important roles in one's maintenance of \n self-esteem \n One's self-esteem is affected by their evaluation of their own performance and their perception of how others react to their performance As a result people actively portray impressions that will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others \n Social interaction \n Goffman argued in his book \n Interaction ritual \n that people participate in social interactions by performing a \"line\" or \"pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts\" which is created and maintained by both the performer and the audience \n By enacting a line effectively the person gains positive social value which is also called \"face\" The success of a social interaction will depend on whether the performer has the ability to maintain face \n As a result a person is required to display a kind of character by becoming \"someone who can be relied upon to maintain himself as an interactant poised for communication and to act so that others do not endanger themselves by presenting themselves as interactants to him\" \n When Goffman turned to focus on people physically presented in a social interaction the \"social dimension of impression management certainly extends beyond the specific place and time of engagement in the organization\" Impression management is \"a social activity that has individual and community implications\" \n We call it \"pride\" when a person displays a good showing from duty to himself while we call it \"honor\" when he \"does so because of duty to wider social units and receives support from these duties in doing so\" \n Another approach to moral standards that Goffman pursues is the notion of \"rules of conduct\" which \"can be partially understood as obligations or moral constraints\" These rules may be substantive involving laws morality and ethics or ceremonial involving etiquette \n Rules of conduct play an important role when a relationship \"is asymmetrical and the expectations of one person toward another are hierarchical \" \n Dramaturgical analogy \n Goffman presented impression management \n dramaturgically \n explaining the motivations behind complex human performances within a social setting based on a play metaphor \n Goffman's work incorporates aspects of a symbolic \n interactionist \n perspective \n emphasizing a qualitative analysis of the interactive nature of the communication process Impression management requires the physical presence of others Performers who seek certain ends in their interest must \"work to adapt their behavior in such a way as to give off the correct impression to a particular audience\" and \"implicitly ask that the audience take their performance seriously\" \n The actor shaped by the environment and target audience sees interaction as a performance The objective of the performance is to provide the audience with an impression consistent with the desired goals of the actor \n Thus impression management is also highly dependent on the situation \n In addition to these goals individuals differ in responses from the interactive environment some may be non-responsive to an audience's reactions while others actively respond to audience reactions in order to elicit positive results These differences in response towards the environment and target audience are called \n self-monitoring \n Another factor in impression management is \n self-verification \n the act of conforming the audience to the person's \n self-concept \n The audience can be real or imaginary IM style norms part of the mental programming received through socialization are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them While an actor speaker tries to project a desired image an audience listener might attribute a resonant or discordant image An example is provided by situations in which embarrassment occurs and threatens the image of a participant \n Goffman proposes that performers \"can use dramaturgical discipline as a defense to ensure that the 'show' goes on without interruption \" \n Goffman contends that dramaturgical discipline includes \n coping with dramaturgical contingencies \n demonstrating intellectual and emotional involvement \n remembering one's part and not committing unmeant gestures or faux pas \n not giving away secrets involuntarily \n covering up inappropriate behavior on the part of teammates on the spur of the moment \n offering plausible reasons or deep apologies for disruptive events \n maintaining self-control for example speaking briefly and modestly \n suppressing emotions to private problems and \n suppressing spontaneous feelings \n Manipulation and ethics \n In business \"managing impressions\" normally \"involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them\" The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical \n manipulation \n Some people insist that impression management can reveal a truer version of the self by adopting the strategy of being \n transparent \n which is a kind of openness Because \n transparency \n \"can be provided so easily and because it produces information of value to the audience it changes the nature of impression management from being cynically manipulative to being a kind of useful adaptation\" \n Virtue signalling \n is used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action having a real or permanent rather than apparent or temporary existence \n Psychological manipulation \n is a type of \n social influence \n that aims to change the behavior or \n perception \n of others through \n abusive \n deceptive \n or underhanded tactics \n By advancing the interests of the manipulator often at another's expense such methods could be considered exploitative abusive devious and deceptive The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of the manipulator often using deception and using the victim to serve their own purposes \n Machiavellianism \n is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others \n Machiavellianism in the workplace \n In modern usage \n sophism \n sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly A sophism is a \n specious \n argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments \n Application \n Face-to-face communication \n Self social identity and social interaction \n The social psychologist Edward E Jones brought the study of impression management to the field of psychology during the 1960s and extended it to include people's attempts to control others' impression of their personal characteristics \n His work sparked an increased attention towards impression management as a fundamental interpersonal process \n The concept of \n self \n is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions \n Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life \n Schlenker further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them They control the impressions they might form on others and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions \n Social identity \n refers to how people are defined and regarded in social interactions \n Individuals use impression management strategies to influence the social identity they project to others \n The identity that people establish influences their behaviour in front of others others' treatment of them and the outcomes they receive Therefore in their attempts to influence the impressions others form of themselves a person plays an important role in affecting his social outcomes \n Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us In a nutshell social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return \n The most basic function of self-presentation is to define the nature of a social situation Goffman Most social interactions are very role governed Each person has a role to play and the interaction proceeds smoothly when these roles are enacted effectively People also strive to create impressions of themselves in the minds of others in order to gain material and social rewards or avoid material and social punishments \n Cross-cultural communication \n Understanding how one's impression management behavior might be interpreted by others can also serve as the basis for smoother interactions and as a means for solving some of the most insidious communication problems among individuals of different racial/ethnic and gender backgrounds \n \"People are sensitive to how they are seen by others and use many forms of impression management to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish\" Giddens p An example of this concept is easily illustrated through cultural differences Different cultures have diverse thoughts and opinions on what is considered beautiful or attractive For example Americans tend to find tan skin attractive but in Indonesian culture pale skin is more desirable \n Another illustration of how people attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear A person who is in a leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario The clothing people choose to wear says a great deal about the person and the culture they represent For example most Americans are not overly concerned with conservative clothing Most Americans are content with tee shirts shorts and showing skin The exact opposite is true on the other side of the world \"Indonesians are both modest and conservative in their attire\" Cole p \n Companies use \n cross-cultural training \n CCT to facilitate effective cross-cultural interaction CCT can be defined as any procedure used to increase an individual's ability to cope with and work in a foreign environment Training employees in culturally consistent and specific impression management IM techniques provide the avenue for the employee to consciously switch from an automatic home culture IM mode to an IM mode that is culturally appropriate and acceptable Second training in IM reduces the uncertainty of interaction with FNs and increases employee's ability to cope by reducing unexpected events \n Team-working in hospital wards \n Impression management theory can also be used in health communication It can be used to explore how professionals 'present' themselves when interacting on hospital wards and also how they employ front stage and backstage settings in their collaborative work \n In the hospital wards Goffman's front stage and backstage performances are divided into 'planned' and 'ad hoc' rather than 'official' and 'unofficial' interactions \n Planned front stage is the structured collaborative activities such as ward rounds and care conferences which took place in the presence of patients and/or carers \n Ad hoc front stage is the unstructured or unplanned interprofessional interactions that took place in front of patients/carers or directly involved patients/carers \n Planned backstage is the structured MDT meetings in which professionals gathered in a private area of the ward in the absence of patients to discuss management plans for patients under their care \n Ad hoc backstage is the use of corridors and other ward spaces for quick conversations between professionals in the absence of patients/carers \n Offstage is the social activities between and among professional groups/individuals outside of the hospital context \n Results show that interprofessional interactions in this setting are often based less on planned front stage activities than on ad hoc backstage activities While the former may at times help create and maintain an appearance of collaborative interprofessional 'teamwork' conveying a sense of professional togetherness in front of patients and their families they often serve little functional practice These findings have implications for designing ways to improve interprofessional practice on acute hospital wards where there is no clearly defined interprofessional team but rather a loose configuration of professionals working together in a collaborative manner around a particular patient In such settings interventions that aim to improve both ad hoc as well as planned forms of communication may be more successful than those intended to only improve planned communication \n Computer-mediated communication \n The \n hyperpersonal model \n of \n computer-mediated communication \n CMC posits that users exploit the technological aspects of CMC in order to enhance the messages they construct to manage impressions and facilitate desired relationships The most interesting aspect of the advent of CMC is how it reveals basic elements of interpersonal communication bringing into focus fundamental processes that occur as people meet and develop relationships relying on typed messages as the primary mechanism of expression \"Physical features such as one's appearance and voice provide much of the information on which people base first impressions face-to-face but such features are often unavailable in CMC Various perspectives on CMC have suggested that the lack of nonverbal cues diminishes CMC's ability to foster impression formation and management or argued impressions develop nevertheless relying on language and content cues One approach that describes the way that CMC's technical capacities work in concert with users' impression development intentions is the hyperpersonal model of CMC Walther As receivers CMC users idealize partners based on the circumstances or message elements that suggest minimal similarity or desirability As senders CMC users selectively self-present revealing attitudes and aspects of the self in a controlled and socially desirable fashion The CMC channel facilitates editing discretion and convenience and the ability to tune out environmental distractions and re-allocate cognitive resources in order to further enhance one's message composition Finally CMC may create dynamic feedback loops wherein the exaggerated expectancies are confirmed and reciprocated through mutual interaction via the bias-prone communication processes identified above \" \n According to O'Sullivan's impression management model of communication channels individuals will prefer to use mediated channels rather than face-to-face conversation in face-threatening situations Within his model this trend is due to the channel features that allow for control over exchanged social information The present paper extends O'Sullivan's model by explicating information control as a media affordance arising from channel features and social skills that enables an individual to regulate and restrict the flow of social information in an interaction and present a scale to measure it One dimension of the information control scale expressive information control positively predicted channel preference for recalled face-threatening situations This effect remained after controlling for social anxiousness and power relations in relationships O'Sullivan's model argues that some communication channels may help individuals manage this struggle and therefore be more preferred as those situations arise It was based on an assumption that channels with features that allow fewer social cues such as reduced nonverbal information or slower exchange of messages invariably afford an individual with an ability to better manage the flow of a complex ambiguous or potentially difficult conversations \n Individuals manage what information about them is known or isn't known to control other's impression of them Anyone who has given the bathroom a quick cleaning when they anticipate the arrival of their mother-in-law or date has managed their impression For an example from \n information and communication technology \n use inviting someone to view a person's Webpage before a face-to-face meeting may predispose them to view the person a certain way when they actually meet \n Corporate brand \n The impression management perspective offers potential insight into how corporate stories could build the corporate brand by influencing the impressions that stakeholders form of the organization The link between themes and elements of corporate stories and IM strategies/behaviours indicates that these elements will influence audiences' perceptions of the corporate brand \n Corporate storytelling \n Corporate storytelling is suggested to help demonstrate the importance of the corporate brand to internal and external stakeholders and create a position for the company against competitors as well as help a firm to bond with its employees Roper and Fill The corporate reputation is defined as a stakeholder's perception of the organization Brown et al and Dowling suggests that if the story causes stakeholders to perceive the organization as more authentic distinctive expert sincere powerful and likeable then it is likely that this will enhance the overall corporate reputation \n Impression management theory is a relevant perspective to explore the use of corporate stories in building the corporate brand The corporate branding literature notes that interactions with brand communications enable stakeholders to form an impression of the organization Abratt and Keyn and this indicates that IM theory could also therefore bring insight into the use of corporate stories as a form of communication to build the corporate brand Exploring the IM strategies/behaviors evident in corporate stories can indicate the potential for corporate stories to influence the impressions that audiences form of the corporate brand \n Corporate document \n Firms use more subtle forms of influencing outsiders' impressions of firm performance and prospects namely by manipulating the content and presentation of information in corporate documents with the purpose of \"distort ing readers\" perceptions of corporate achievements\" Godfrey et al p In the accounting literature this is referred to as impression management The opportunity for impression management in corporate reports is increasing Narrative disclosures have become longer and more sophisticated over the last few years This growing importance of descriptive sections in corporate documents provides firms with the opportunity to overcome information asymmetries by presenting more detailed information and explanation thereby increasing their decision-usefulness However they also offer an opportunity for presenting financial performance and prospects in the best possible light thus having the opposite effect In addition to the increased opportunity for opportunistic discretionary disclosure choices impression management is also facilitated in that corporate narratives are largely unregulated \n Media \n The \n medium of communication influences the actions taken in impression management Self-efficacy can differ according to the fact whether the trial to convince somebody is made through face-to-face-interaction or by means of an e-mail \n Communication via devices like telephone e-mail or chat is governed by technical restrictions so that the way people express personal features etc can be changed This often shows how far people will go \n Profiles on social networking sites \n Social networking users will employ protective self-presentations for image management Users will use subtractive and repudiate strategies to maintain a desired image \n Subtractive strategy is used to untag an undesirable photo on Social Networking Sites In addition to un-tagging their name some users will request the photo to be removed entirely Repudiate strategy is used when a friend posts an undesirable comment about the user In response to an undesired post users may add another wall post as an innocence defense Michael Stefanone states that \"self-esteem maintenance is an important motivation for strategic self-presentation online \" \n Outside evaluations of their physical appearance competence and approval from others determines how social media users respond to pictures and wall posts Unsuccessful self-presentation online can lead to rejection and criticism from social groups Social networking sites like MySpace Facebook and StudiVZ are popular means of communicating personality Recent theoretical and empirical considerations of homepages and Web platforms show that impression management is a major motive for actively participating in social networking sites \n According to Marwick social profiles create implications such as \"context collapse\" for presenting oneself to the audience The concept of context collapse suggests that social technologies make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience \"Large sites such as Facebook and Twitter group friends family members coworkers and acquaintances together under the umbrella term friends \" \n Not only do users on social networking sites present themselves using photos of themselves but they also use different symbols and \n cultural artifacts \n For example researchers have found that food and situations related to food such as restaurant visits is part of adolescents' self-presentation on online social networks This indicates that messages of food serve a symbolic purpose in these online social networks and it is also argued that this communication influence adolescents in both positive and negative ways with regards to their health \n Political impression management \n One arena where impression management is essential is in politics \"Political impression management\" was coined in by sociologist Peter M Hall who defined the term as the art of making a candidate look electable and capable Hall This is due in part to the importance of \"presidential\" candidatesappearance image and narrative are a key part of a campaign and thus impression management has always been a huge part of winning an election Katz As social media becomes more and more a part of the political process political impression management is becoming more challenging as the online image of the candidate often now lies in the hands of the voters themselves \n Implications \n Impression management can distort the results of empirical research that relies on interviews and surveys a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"social desirability bias\" Impression management theory nevertheless constitutes a field of research on its own \n When it comes to practical questions concerning public relations and the way organizations should handle their public image the assumptions provided by impression management theory can also provide a framework \n An examination of different impression management strategies acted out by individuals who were facing criminal trials where the trial outcomes could range from a death sentence life in prison or acquittal has been reported in the forensic literature \n The Perri and Lichtenwald article examined female \n psychopathic \n killers whom as a group were highly motivated to manage the impression that attorneys judges mental health professions and ultimately a jury had of the murderers and the murder they committed It provides legal case illustrations of the murderers combining and/or switching from one impression management strategy such as ingratiation or supplication to another as they worked towards their goal of diminishing or eliminating any accountability for the murders they committed \n Since the 1990s researchers in the area of sport and exercise psychology have studied self-presentation Concern about how one is perceived has been found to be relevant to the study of athletic performance For example anxiety may be produced when an athlete is in the presence of spectators Self-presentational concerns have also been found to be relevant to exercise For example the concerns may elicit motivation to exercise \n More recent research investigating the effects of impression management on social behaviour showed that social behaviours e g eating can serve to convey a desired impression to others and enhance one's self-image Research on eating has shown that people tend to eat less when they believe that they are being observed by others \n Calculating Visions Kennedy Johnson and

warning of prohibited activities an example of a social control \n Social control \n is a \n concept \n within the \n disciplines \n of the \n social sciences \n Sociologists \n identify two basic forms of social control \n Informal means of control \n Internalization \n of \n norms \n and \n values \n by a process known as \n socialization \n which is defined as \"the process by which an individual born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range is led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what is acceptable for him by the \n group standards \n \" \n Formal means of social control \n External \n sanctions \n enforced by government to prevent the establishment of \n chaos \n or \n anomie \n in society Some theorists such as \n mile Durkheim \n refer to this form of control as \n regulation \n As briefly defined above the means to enforce social control can be either informal or formal \n Sociologist \n Edward A Ross \n argues that \n belief \n systems exert a greater control on human behavior than laws imposed by government no matter what form the beliefs take \n Social control is considered to be one of the foundations of \n order within society \n Definition of the concept \n Informal \n Social values \n Sanctions \n Reward and punishment \n Theoretical bias within the modern media \n Formal \n Historically \n Techniques \n Broken windows theory in the United States \n Recent developments \n Definition of the concept \n Roodenburg identifies the concept of social control as a classical concept \n While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology the meaning has been altered over time Originally the concept simply referred to society's ability to \n regulate itself \n However in the 1930s the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual's conversion to \n conformity \n Social control theory \n began to be studied as a separate field in the early 20th century \n The concept of social control is related to another concept which is the notion of \n social order \n Social control is a thing which is identified as existing in the following areas of society \n The \n education system \n Policing \n and the \n law \n Psychiatry \n Social work \n The \n welfare state \n The \n working environment \n Informal \n Social values \n The social values present in individuals are products of informal social control exercised implicitly by a society through particular \n customs \n norms \n and \n mores \n Individuals internalize the values of their society whether conscious or not of the indoctrination \n Traditional society \n relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary \n culture \n to socialize its members \n Sanctions \n Informal sanctions may include \n shame \n ridicule \n sarcasm \n criticism \n and disapproval which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society In extreme cases sanctions may include social \n discrimination \n and \n exclusion \n Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become \n internalized \n thus becoming an aspect of the individual's \n personality \n Informal sanctions check ' \n deviant \n ' behavior An example of a negative sanction comes from a scene in the Pink Floyd film \n The Wall \n whereby the young protagonist is ridiculed and verbally \n abused \n by a high school teacher for writing poetry in a mathematics class Another example from the movie \n About a Boy \n when a young boy hesitates to jump from a high springboard and is ridiculed for his fear Though he eventually jumps his behavior is controlled by shame \n Reward and punishment \n Mesolimbic pathway \n and \n Reward system \n Informal controls reward or \n punish \n acceptable or unacceptable behavior i e \n deviance \n and are varied from individual to individual group to group and society to society For example at a \n Women's Institute \n meeting a disapproving look might convey the message that it is inappropriate to flirt with the minister In a \n criminal gang \n on the other hand a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity \n Theoretical bias within the modern media \n Theorists such as \n Noam Chomsky \n have argued that \n systemic bias \n exists in the modern media \n The \n marketing \n advertising \n and \n public relations \n industries have thus been said to utilize \n mass communications \n to aid the interests of certain political and business elites Powerful ideological economic and religious \n lobbyists \n have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence \n public opinion \n Formal \n Historically \n Social control developed together with civilization as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature which \n tribal \n organisations were at prey to within archaic tribal societies \n Rulers \n have \n legitimately \n used \n torture \n as a means of \n mind control \n as well as \n murder \n imprisonment \n and \n exile \n to remove from public space anyone the state authorities deemed to be undesirable \n During the \n Age of Enlightenment \n harsh penalties for \n crimes \n and \n civil disobedience \n were criticized by \n philosophers \n such as \n Cesare Beccaria \n and \n Jeremy Bentham \n whose work inspired \n reform movements \n which eventually led to the \n Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n in which informs most western \n jurisdictions \n and the similar \n Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam \n in \n The word \n crime \n became part of the \n vocabulary \n of the \n English language \n via \n Old French \n during the \n Middle Ages \n and within the \n Middle English \n of the language \n In history \n religion \n was a factor which provided moral influence on the community and each person providing an internal \n locus of control \n oriented toward a \n morality \n so that each person was empowered to have a degree of control over themselves within society As \n Auguste Comte \n instituted sociology \n 1830-1842 \n already certain thinkers had predicted the discontinuation of a perceived \n false consciousness \n intrinsic to religious belief Nevertheless within the twentieth century religion was presumed by social scientists to be still a principal factor of social control \n Comte and those preceding him were breathing the air of a \n revolution \n which occurred during the latter parts of the eighteenth century \n French Revolution \n to bring about a so-called enlightened way of being in society and which brought about a new \n liberty \n for the individual without the constraints of an over-seeing \n aristocracy \n In the context social control through penal and correctional services the \n rehabilatative ideal \n Francis Allen is a key idea formed within the 20th century the first principle of which is behavior has as a first cause things which happened before \"Human behaviour is a product of antecedent causes\" \n The idea was later thought to have less relevancy to the philosophy and exaction or execution of correctional measures at least according to a publication and elsewhere \n Techniques \n Law \n is a technique used for the purposes of social control \n For example there are certain laws regarding appropriate sexual relationships and these are largely based on societal values Historically homosexuality has been criminalised In modern times this is no longer an offence and this is due to shifts in society's values Howerever there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control \n A mechanism of social control occurs through the use of selective incentives \n Selective incentives are \n private goods \n which are gifts or services \n made available to people depending on whether they do or don't contribute to the good of a group collective or the common good If people do contribute they are rewarded if they don't they are punished \n Mancur Olson \n gave rise to the concept in its first instance c f \n The Logic of Collective Action \n Oberschall in his work identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society These are confrontational control such as \n riot control \n and \n crowd control \n preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior and measures complementary to preventative measures which amount to punishment of criminal offences \n Park exclusion orders prohibiting individuals from frequenting one some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period of time due to a previous infraction trespass laws privatizing areas generally thought of as public in order for the police to choose which individuals to interrogate and off-limit orders Stay Out of Drug Areas SODA and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution SOAP which obstructs access to these spaces are just a few of the new social control techniques employed by cities to displace certain individuals to the margins of society \n Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration \n Although not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order will abide to it these individuals are at the very least spatially hindered through decreased mobility and freedom throughout the city \n This spatial constrain on individuals leads to a serious disruption and interference of their lives Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping public washrooms occasional public services and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions Privatizing areas such as libraries public transportation systems college campuses and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit even if the individual has ethical intent in the space Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts prostitutes and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals' ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories \n Broken windows theory in the United States \n In the United States early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through \n vagrancy \n laws and other forms of banishment In the 1960s and 1970s however these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America \n and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court \n The introduction of \n broken windows theory \n in the 1980s generated a dramatic transformation in the concepts used in forming policies in order to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality \n According to the theory the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public including to potential vandals By maintaining an organized environment individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location However environments filled with disorder such as broken windows or graffiti indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity \n Instead of focusing on the built environment policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime \n The civility laws originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces \n These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable such as sitting or lying on sidewalks sleeping in parks urinating or \n drinking in public \n and begging \n in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society \n Not surprisingly then \n these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless \n Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into \n social norms \n which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods \n This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society \n In the \n post-industrial city \n concerned primarily with retail tourism and the service sector \n the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control \n These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions \n Recent developments \n In the decades prior to the end of the 1980s an increased prevalence of the \n individual \n as a feature within society has caused a high number of new \n therapists \n to be established suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control Conrad & Scheider Mechanic \n Authority bias \n Countercontrol \n Criminal justice \n Cybernetics \n Guilt

{"theme.id": 9, "title": "Conformity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity", "depth": 0, "text": "Conformity \n Conformity \n is the act of matching attitudes beliefs and behaviors to group \n norms \n Norms are implicit specific rules shared by a group of individuals that guide their interactions with others This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole and may result from subtle unconscious influences or direct and overt \n social pressure \n Conformity can occur in the presence of others or when an individual is alone For example people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television even when alone \n People often conform from a desire for security within a grouptypically a group of a similar age culture religion or educational status This is often referred to as \n groupthink \n a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception forced manufacture of consent and conformity to group values and ethics which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of \n social rejection \n Conformity is often associated with adolescence and \n youth culture \n but strongly affects humans of all ages \n Although \n peer pressure \n may manifest negatively conformity can be regarded as either good or bad Driving on the correct side of the road could be seen as beneficial conformity \n With the right environmental influence conforming in early childhood years allows one to learn and thus adopt the appropriate behaviours necessary to interact and develop correctly within one's society \n Conformity influences formation and maintenance of \n social norms \n and helps societies function smoothly and predictably via the self-elimination of behaviors seen as contrary to unwritten rules In this sense it can be perceived as a positive force that prevents acts that are perceptually disruptive or dangerous \n As conformity is a \n group \n phenomenon factors such as group size unanimity cohesion \n status \n prior commitment and \n public opinion \n help determine the level of conformity an individual displays \n Peer \n Social responses \n Main experiments \n Sherif's experiment \n Asch's experiment \n Varieties \n Informational influence \n Normative influence \n Minority influence \n Specific predictors \n Culture \n Gender \n Age \n Size of the group \n Different stimuli \n Neural correlates \n Peer \n Some adolescents gain acceptance and recognition from their peers by conformity This peer moderated conformity increases from the transition of childhood to adolescence \n Social responses \n According to Donelson Forsyth after submitting to group pressures individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement \n When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus they are experiencing \n compliance \n or \n acquiescence \n In turn \n conversion \n otherwise known as \n private acceptance \n involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision Thus this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority \n Another type of social response which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group is called \n convergence \n In this type of social response the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand \n In addition Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories Firstly an individual who does not conform to the majority can display \n independence \n Independence \n or \n dissent \n can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures Thus this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards Secondly a nonconformist could be displaying \n anticonformity \n or \n counterconformity \n which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion \n To conclude social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity For example a popular experiment in conformity research known as the \n Asch situation \n or \n Asch conformity experiments \n primarily includes \n compliance \n and \n independence \n Also other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries sports teams and work teams \n Main experiments \n Sherif's experiment \n Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group In his experiment participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light feet away They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved The trick was there was no movement it was caused by a visual illusion known as the \n autokinetic effect \n On the first day each person perceived different amounts of movement but from the second to the fourth day the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it \n Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society providing a common frame of reference for people \n Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations In an eyewitness identification task participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects They were given one second to identify him making it a difficult task One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community To the other it was simply a trial Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group \n Asch's experiment \n Asch conformity experiments \n Which line matches the first line A B or C? In the \n Asch conformity experiments \n people frequently followed the majority judgment even when the majority was wrong \n Solomon E Asch conducted a modification of Sherifs study assuming that when the situation was very clear conformity would be drastically reduced He exposed people in a group to a series of lines and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in of the trials \n The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial On average people conformed one third of the time \n A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious \n After his first test Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects \"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to persons \" \n The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject the subject became more likely to conform However the increasing majority was only influential up to a point from three or more opponents there is more than 30% of conformity \n Varieties \n Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three major types of conformity \n Compliance \n is public conformity while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected \n Identification \n is conforming to someone who is liked and respected such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source \n and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance \n Internalization \n is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately if the source is credible It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time \n Although Kelman's distinction has been influential research in \n social psychology \n has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity These are \n informational \n conformity or \n informational social influence \n and \n normative \n conformity also called \n normative social influence \n In Kelman's terminology these correspond to internalization and compliance respectively There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human \n psychology \n and conformity the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context \n For Deutsch and Grard conformity results from a motivational conflict between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct that leads to the normative influence and a cognitive conflict others create doubts in what we think which leads to the informational influence \n Informational influence \n Informational social influence \n Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations when a situation is ambiguous people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary in spite of panic Looking to other people can help ease fears but unfortunately they are not always right The more knowledgeable a person is the more valuable they are as a resource Thus people often turn to \n experts \n for help But once again people must be careful as experts can make mistakes too Informational social influence often results in \n internalization \n or \n private acceptance \n where a person genuinely believes that the information is right \n Normative influence \n Normative social influence \n Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans \n In addition to this we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants they are less liked and even punished by the group \n Normative influence usually results in \n public compliance \n doing or saying something without believing in it The experiment of Asch in is one example of normative influence \n In a reinterpretation of the original data from these \n experiments \n Hodges and Geyer \n found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants They include truth i e expressing one's own view accurately trust i e taking seriously the value of others' claims and social solidarity i e a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either In addition to these epistemic values there are multiple moral claims as well These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants the experimenter themselves and the worth of scientific research \n Deutsch & Grard designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately they were giving the correct one \n Normative influence a function of \n social impact theory \n has three components \n The \n number of people \n in the group has a surprising effect As the number increases each person has less of an impact A group's \n strength \n is how important the group is to a person Groups we value generally have more social influence \n Immediacy \n is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy \n Baron and his colleagues conducted a second \n eyewitness study \n that focused on normative influence In this version the task was easier Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second Once again there were both high and low motives to be accurate but the results were the reverse of the first study The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time similar to Asch's findings The high motivation group conformed less at 16% These results show that when accuracy is not very important it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval \n An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of \n friends \n as compared to six-person groups of strangers \n Because friends already know and accept each other there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse however generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other \n Minority influence \n Minority influence \n Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them This is known as \n minority influence \n a special case of informational influence Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty the chance of influence is small However a minority that makes a strong convincing case increases the probability of changing the majority's beliefs and behaviors \n Minority members who are perceived as experts are high in status or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed \n Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics A review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" an inconsiderate or negligent group member can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction \n Specific predictors \n Culture \n Stanley Milgram \n found that individuals in Norway from a collectivistic culture exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France from an individualistic culture \n Similarly Berry studied two different populations the Temne collectivists and the Inuit individualists and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task \n Bond and Smith compared studies in a meta-analysis and found that Japan and Brazil were two nations that conformed a lot whereas Europe and the United States of America did not as much \n Bond and Smith also reported that conformity has declined in the United States over time \n Gender \n Societal norms often establish gender differences and researchers have reported differences in the way men and women conform to social influence \n For example Alice Eagly and Linda Carli performed a meta-analysis of studies of influenceability They found that women are more persuadable and more conforming than men in group pressure situations that involve surveillance \n Eagly has proposed that this sex difference may be due to different sex roles in society \n Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent \n The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well In a study by Reitan and Shaw it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments \n Sistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias \n They argued that because stereotypes used in studies are generally male ones sports cars more than female ones cooking fashion women are feeling uncertain and conformed more which was confirmed by their results \n Age \n Research has noted age differences in conformity For example research with Australian children and adolescents ages to discovered that conformity decreases with age \n Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages to \n The results revealed a similar trend older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants \n In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status age has also been argued to have status implications Berger Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students Younger students such as those in their first year in college are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals \n Therefore given these status roles it would be expected that younger individuals low status conform to the majority whereas older individuals high status would be expected not to conform \n Researchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity \n Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age under years vs years and older gender and surveillance anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs not anticipating responses being shared on conformity to group opinions They discovered that among participants that were years or older females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance i e anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members However there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under years of age and in surveillance conditions There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance In a subsequent research article Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society She suggests that more submissive roles i e conforming are expected of individuals that hold low status roles \n Still Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals \n Size of the group \n Although conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number \n Moreover a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating \n This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong conformity will be motivated by normative influence the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response However conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response \n Different stimuli \n In Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines he conducted his study in Norway and France \n He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli and that in the case of tones there was a high degree of conformity \n Neural correlates \n Evidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex pMFC in conformity \n an area associated with memory and decision-making For example Klucharev et al \n revealed in their study that by using repetitive \n transcranial magnetic stimulation \n on the pMFC participants reduced their tendency to conform to the group suggesting a causal role for the brain region in social conformity In another study the mPFC was linked to \n normative social influence \n whilst the activity in the \n caudate \n was regarded as an index of \n informational influence \n The \n amygdala \n and \n hippocampus \n have also been found to be recruited when individuals participated in a social manipulation experiment involving long-term memory \n Several other areas have further been suggested to play a role in conformity including the \n insula \n the \n temporoparietal junction \n the \n ventral striatum \n and the anterior and posterior \n cingulate cortices \n More recent work \n stresses the role of \n orbitofrontal cortex \n OFC in conformity not only at the time of social influence \n but also later on when participants are given an opportunity to conform by selecting an action In particular Charpentier et al found that the OFC mirrors the exposure to social influence at a subsequent time point when a decision is being made without the social influence being present The tendency to conform has also been observed in the structure of the OFC with a greater \n grey matter \n volume in high conformers \n Psychology portal \n Sociology portal \n Authoritarian personality \n Countersignaling \n Cultural assimilation \n Milieu control \n

modified by his successor \n John Stuart Mill \n who popularized the word 'Utilitarianism' \n In Mill acknowledged in a footnote that though \"believing himself to be the first person who brought the word 'utilitarian' into use he did not invent it Rather he adopted it from a passing expression in\" \n John Galt \n 's novel \n Annals of the Parish \n Mill seems to have been unaware that Bentham had used the term 'utilitarian' in his letter to George Wilson and his letter to \n tienne Dumont \n Historical background \n Chinese philosophy \n In \n Chinese philosophy \n the \n Mohists \n and their successors the \n \"Chinese Legalists\" \n citation needed \n might be considered utilitarians or at least the \"earliest form of \n consequentialism \n \" The fourth century witnessed the emergence of particular concerns for them including discussions polarizing the concepts of self and private commonly used in conjunction with profit and associated with fragmentation division partiality and one-sidelines with that of the state and \"public\" represented by the duke and referring to what is official or royal that is the ruler himself associated with unity wholeness objectivity and universality The later denotes the \"universal Way\" \n However the Mohists did not focus on emotional happiness but promoted objective public goods material wealth a large population or family and social order \n On the other hand the \"Legalist\" \n Han Fei \n \"is motivated almost totally from the ruler's point of view \" \n Western philosophy \n Hedonism \n The importance of \n happiness \n as an end for humans has long been recognized Forms of \n hedonism \n were put forward by \n Aristippus \n and \n Epicurus \n Aristotle \n argued that \n eudaimonia \n is the highest human good and \n Augustine \n wrote that \"all men agree in desiring the last end which is happiness \" Happiness was also explored in depth by \n Aquinas \n Different varieties of consequentialism also existed in the ancient and medieval world like the \n state consequentialism \n of \n Mohism \n or the political philosophy of \n Niccol Machiavelli \n Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods including political stability population growth and wealth but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness \n Machiavelli was also an exponent of consequentialism He believed that the actions of a state however cruel or ruthless they may be must contribute towards the common good of a society \n Utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the eighteenth century \n Although utilitarianism is usually thought to start with \n Jeremy Bentham \n there were earlier writers who presented theories that were strikingly similar In \n An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals \n David Hume \n writes \n In all determinations of \n morality \n this circumstance of public utility is ever principally in view and wherever disputes arise either in philosophy or common life concerning the bounds of duty the question cannot by any means be decided with greater certainty than by ascertaining on any side the true interests of mankind If any false opinion embraced from appearances has been found to prevail as soon as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions of human affairs we retract our first sentiment and adjust anew the boundaries of moral good and evil \n Hume studied the works of and corresponded with \n Francis Hutcheson \n and it was he who first introduced a key utilitarian phrase In \n An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue \n Hutcheson says \n when choosing the most moral action virtue is in proportion to the number of people a particular action brings happiness to In the same way moral evil or vice is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness of the greatest numbersand the worst is the one that causes the most misery \n In the first three editions of the book Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms \" to compute the Morality of any Actions \" In this he pre-figured the \n hedonic calculus \n of Bentham \n Some claim that \n John Gay \n developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics \n In \n Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality \n Gay argues that \n happiness private happiness is the proper or ultimate end of all our actions each particular action may be said to have its proper and peculiar end but they still tend or ought to tend to something farther as is evident from hence viz that a man may ask and expect a reason why either of them are pursued now to ask the reason of any action or pursuit is only to enquire into the end of it but to expect a reason i e an end to be assigned for an ultimate end is absurd To ask why I pursue happiness will admit of no other answer than an explanation of the terms \n This pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis \n Now it is evident from the nature of God viz his being infinitely happy in himself from all eternity and from his goodness manifested in his works that he could have no other design in creating mankind than their happiness and therefore he wills their happiness therefore the means of their happiness therefore that my behaviour as far as it may be a means of the happiness of mankind should be suchthus the will of God is the immediate criterion of Virtue and the happiness of mankind the criterion of the wilt of God and therefore the happiness of mankind may be said to be the criterion of virtue but once removed and I am to do whatever lies in my power towards promoting the happiness of mankind \n Modern Utilitarianism \n by \n Thomas Rawson Birks \n Gay's theological utilitarianism was developed and popularized by \n William Paley \n It has been claimed that Paley was not a very original thinker and that the philosophical part of his treatise on ethics is \"an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues \" \n Nevertheless his book \n The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy \n was a required text at Cambridge \n and Smith says that Paley's writings were \"once as well known in American colleges as were the readers and spellers of William McGuffey and Noah Webster in the elementary schools \" \n Although now largely missing from the philosophical canon Schneewind writes that \"utilitarianism first became widely known in England through the work of William Paley \" \n The now forgotten significance of Paley can be judged from the title of \n Thomas Rawson Birks \n 's work \n Modern Utilitarianism or the Systems of Paley Bentham and Mill Examined and Compared \n Apart from restating that happiness as an end is grounded in the nature of God Paley also discusses the place of rules He writes \n actions are to be estimated by their tendency Whatever is expedient is right It is the utility of any moral rule alone which constitutes the obligation of it \n But to all this there seems a plain objection viz that many actions are useful which no man in his senses will allow to be right There are occasions in which the hand of the assassin would be very useful The true answer is this that these actions after all are not useful and for that reason and that alone are not right \n To see this point perfectly it must be observed that the bad consequences of actions are twofold particular and general The particular bad consequence of an action is the mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions The general bad consequence is the violation of some necessary or useful general rule \n You cannot permit one action and forbid another without showing a difference between them Consequently the same sort of actions must be generally permitted or generally forbidden Where therefore the general permission of them would be pernicious it becomes necessary to lay down and support the rule which generally forbids them \n Classical utilitarianism \n Jeremy Bentham \n Jeremy Bentham \n Jeremy Bentham \n Bentham's book \n An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation \n was printed in but not published until It is possible that Bentham was spurred on to publish after he saw the success of Paley's \n The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy \n Bentham's book was not an immediate success \n but his ideas were spread further when \n Pierre tienne Louis Dumont \n translated edited selections from a variety of Bentham's manuscripts into French \n Trait de legislation civile et pnale \n was published in and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as \n The Theory of Legislation \n although by this time significant portions of Dumont's work had already been retranslated and incorporated into \n Sir John Bowring's \n edition of Bentham's works which was issued in parts between and \n Bentham's work opens with a statement of the principle of utility \n Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters pain and pleasure It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question or what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness I say of every action whatsoever and therefore not only of every action of a private individual but of every measure of government \n In Chapter IV Bentham introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain considered by itself can be measured according to its intensity duration certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness In addition it is necessary to consider \"the tendency of any act by which it is produced\" and therefore to take account of the act's fecundity or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind Finally it is necessary to consider the extent or the number of people affected by the action \n Perhaps aware that Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they \"appear'd useless and were disagreeable to some readers\" \n Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method for \"in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest is perfectly conformable to \" \n Rosen warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear \"little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and \n J S Mill \n \" and can be more \"a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a \n straw man \n to be attacked and rejected \" \n It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words \"Pleasures then and the avoidance of pains are the ends that the legislator has in view \" In Chapter VII Bentham says \"The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society by punishing and rewarding In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious will be the demand it creates for punishment \" \n The question then arises as to when if at all it might be legitimate to break the law This is considered in \n The Theory of Legislation \n where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second orders Those of the first order are the more immediate consequences those of the second are when the consequences spread through the community causing \"alarm\" and \"danger\" \n It is true there are cases in which if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil Were the offence considered only under this point of view it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime and which makes punishment necessary Let us take for example the physical desire of satisfying hunger Let a beggar pressed by hunger steal from a rich man's house a loaf which perhaps saves him from starving can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself with the evil which the rich man suffers? It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences but on account of the evil of the second order \n John Stuart Mill \n John Stuart Mill \n Mill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism \n Mill's book \n Utilitarianism \n first appeared as a series of three articles published in \n Fraser's Magazine \n in and was reprinted as a single book in \n citation needed \n Higher and lower pleasures \n Mill rejects a purely quantitative measurement of utility and says \n It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognize the fact that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others It would be absurd that while in estimating all other things quality is considered as well as quantity the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone \n The word utility is used to mean general well-being or happiness and Mill's view is that utility is the consequence of a good action Utility within the context of utilitarianism refers to people performing actions for social utility With social utility he means the well-being of many people Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work Utilitarianism is that people really do desire happiness and since each individual desires their own happiness it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone contributing to a larger social utility Thus an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action or as Jeremy Bentham the founder of early Utilitarianism put it as the greatest happiness of the greatest number \n Mill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility but as the directive rule of moral human conduct The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society This view of pleasure was hedonistic as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life This concept was adopted by Jeremy Bentham the founder of Utilitarianism and can be seen in his works According to Mill good actions result in pleasure and that there is no higher end than pleasure Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good character Better put the justification of character and whether an action is good or not is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct In the last chapter of Utilitarianism Mill concludes that justice as a classifying factor of our actions being just or unjust is one of the certain moral requirements and when the requirements are all regarded collectively they are viewed as greater according to this scale of \"social utility\" as Mill puts it \n He also notes that contrary to what its critics might say there is \"no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation \" However he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages i e \"greater permanency safety uncostliness &c \" Instead Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others \n The accusation that hedonism is \"doctrine worthy only of swine\" has a long history In \n Nicomachean Ethics \n Book Chapter \n Aristotle \n says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence Mill's approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures \n Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool no instructed person would be an ignoramus no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base even though they should be persuaded that the fool the dunce or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy is capable probably of more acute suffering and certainly accessible to it at more points than one of an inferior type but in spite of these liabilities he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied better to be \n Socrates \n dissatisfied than a fool satisfied And if the fool or the pig are of a different opinion it is because they only know their own side of the question \n Mill argues that if people who are \"competently acquainted\" with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and \"would not resign it for any quantity of the other\" then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality Mill recognizes that these \"competent judges\" will not always agree and states that in cases of disagreement the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final Mill also acknowledges that \"many who are capable of the higher pleasures occasionally under the influence of temptation postpone them to the lower But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher \" Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure for there is no other way of measuring \"the acutest of two pains or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations \" \"It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for as the world is constitute is imperfect \" \n Mill's 'proof' of the principle of utility \n In Chapter Four of \n Utilitarianism \n Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility He says \n The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible is that people actually see it The only proof that a sound is audible is that people hear it In like manner I apprehend the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable is that people do actually desire it No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable except that each person so far as he believes it to be attainable desires his own happiness we have not only all the proof which the case admits of but all which it is possible to require that happiness is a good that each person's happiness is a good to that person and the general happiness therefore a good to the aggregate of all persons \n It is usual \n to say that Mill is committing a number of fallacies He is accused of committing the \n naturalistic fallacy \n because he is trying to deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do the \n fallacy of equivocation \n because he moves from the fact that something is desirable i e is capable of being desired to the claim that it is desirable i e that it ought to be desired and the \n fallacy of composition \n because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness \n Such allegations began to emerge in Mill's lifetime shortly after the publication of \n Utilitarianism \n and persisted for well over a century though the tide has been turning in recent discussions \n A defence of Mill against all three charges with a chapter devoted to each can be found in Necip Fikri Alican's \n Mill's Principle of Utility A Defense of John Stuart Mill's Notorious Proof \n This is the first and remains the only book-length treatment of the subject matter Yet the alleged fallacies in the proof continue to attract scholarly attention in journal articles and book chapters \n Hall \n and Popkin \n defend Mill against this accusation pointing out that he begins Chapter Four by asserting that \"questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof in the ordinary acceptation of the term\" and that this is \"common to all first principles \" According to Hall and Popkin therefore Mill does not attempt to \"establish that what people do desire is desirable but merely attempts to make the principles acceptable \" \n The type of \"proof\" Mill is offering \"consists only of some considerations which Mill thought might induce an honest and reasonable man to accept utilitarianism \" \n Having claimed that people do in fact desire happiness Mill now has to show that it is the \n only \n thing they desire Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a \n means \n to happiness eventually it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself \n The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure as music for instance or any given exemption from pain as for example health are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness and to be desired on that account They are desired and desirable in and for themselves besides being means they are a part of the end Virtue according to the utilitarian doctrine is not naturally and originally part of the end but it is capable of becoming so and in those who love it disinterestedly it has become so and is desired and cherished not as a means to happiness but as a part of their happiness \n We may give what explanation we please of this unwillingness we may attribute it to pride a name which is given indiscriminately to some of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which is mankind are capable we may refer it to the love of liberty and personal independence an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective means for the inculcation of it to the love of power or the love of excitement both of which do really enter into and contribute to it but its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity which all humans beings possess in one form or other and in some though by no means in exact proportion to their higher faculties and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong that nothing which conflicts with it could be otherwise than momentarily an object of desire to them \n Twentieth-century developments \n Ideal utilitarianism \n The description of ideal utilitarianism was first used by \n Hastings Rashdall \n in \n The Theory of Good and Evil \n but it is more often associated with \n G E Moore \n In \n Ethics \n Moore rejected a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argued that there is a range of values that might be maximized Moore's strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good He says that such an assumption \n involves our saying for instance that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existedno knowledge no love no enjoyment of beauty no moral qualitiesmust yet be intrinsically betterbetter worth creatingprovided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure \n It involves our saying that even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter \n Moore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world He adds that if a person was to take the contrary view then \"I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong \" \n Act and rule utilitarianism \n In the mid-twentieth century a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thinking \n It was already accepted that it is necessary to use rules to help you choose the right action because the problems of calculating the consequences on each and every occasion would almost certainly result in you frequently choosing something less than the best course of action Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says \n It is truly a whimsical supposition that if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young and enforced by law and opinion to consider the rules of morality as improvable is one thing to pass over the intermediate generalisations entirely and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle is another The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack Being rational creatures they go to sea with it ready calculated and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong \n However rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping Throughout the 1950s and 1960s articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism and through this debate the theory we now call rule utilitarianism was created In an introduction to an anthology of these articles the editor was able to say \"The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation criticism reply and reformulation the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory \" \n Smart \n and McCloskey \n initially used the terms 'extreme' and 'restricted' utilitarianism but eventually everyone settled on the terms 'act' and 'rule' utilitarianism \n The essential difference is in what determines whether or not an action is the right action \n Act utilitarianism \n maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility rule utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility \n In Urmson published an influential article \n arguing that Mill justified rules on utilitarian principles From then on articles have debated this interpretation of Mill In all probability it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed A collection of Mill's writing published in includes a letter in which he says \n I agree with you that the right way of testing actions by their consequences is to test them by the natural consequences of the particular action and not by those which would follow if everyone did the same But for the most part the consideration of what would happen if everyone did the same is the only means we have of discovering the tendency of the act in the particular case \n This seems to tip the balance in favour of saying that Mill is best classified as an act utilitarian \n Some school level textbooks and at least one UK examination board \n make a further distinction between strong and weak rule utilitarianism However it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature \n It has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism because for any given rule in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception \n This process holds for all cases of exceptions and so the \"rules\" have as many \"sub-rules\" as there are exceptional cases which in the end makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility \n Two-level utilitarianism \n Two-level utilitarianism \n In \n Principles \n R M Hare \n accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be \"as specific and un-general as we please \" He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that \"a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules i e by increasing their generality \" \n This distinction between a \"specific rule utilitarianism\" which collapses into act utilitarianism and \"general rule utilitarianism\" forms the basis of Hare's two-level utilitarianism \n When we are \"playing God or the ideal observer\" we use the specific form and we will need to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow When we are \"inculcating\" or in situations where the biases of our human nature are likely to prevent us doing the calculations properly then we should use the more general rule utilitarianism \n Hare argues that in practice most of the time we should be following the general principles \n One ought to abide by the general principles whose general inculcation is for the best harm is more likely to come in actual moral situations from questioning these rules than from sticking to them unless the situations are very extra-ordinary the results of sophisticated felicific calculations are not likely human nature and human ignorance being what they are to lead to the greatest utility \n In \n Moral Thinking \n Hare illustrated the two extremes The \"archangel\" is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do the \"prole\" is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and of necessity has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation \n It is not that some people are archangels and others proles but rather that \"we all share the characteristics of both to limited and varying degrees and at different times \" \n Hare does not specify when we should think more like an \"archangel\" and more like a \"prole\" as this will in any case vary from person to person However the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking It is responsible for formulating and if necessary reformulating the general moral rules We also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice \n Preference utilitarianism \n Preference utilitarianism \n The concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in by \n John Harsanyi \n in \n Morality and the theory of rational behaviour \n but preference utilitarianism is more commonly associated with \n R M Hare \n Peter Singer \n and \n Richard Brandt \n Harsanyi claimed that his theory is indebted to \n Adam Smith \n who equated the moral point of view with that of an impartial but sympathetic observer to \n Kant \n who insisted on the criterion of universality which may also be described as a criterion of reciprocity to the classical utilitarians who made maximizing social utility the basic criterion of morality and to \"the modern theory of rational behaviour under risk and uncertainty usually described as Bayesian \n decision theory \n \" \n Harsanyi rejects hedonistic utilitarianism as being dependent on an outdated psychology saying that it is far from obvious that everything we do is motivated by a desire to maximize pleasure and minimize pain He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because \"it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people's only purpose in life is to have 'mental states of intrinsic worth' \" \n According to Harsanyi \"preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy By this I mean the principle that in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences \" \n Harsanyi adds two caveats People sometimes have irrational preferences To deal with this Harsanyi distinguishes between \"manifest\" preferences and \"true\" preferences The former are those \"manifested by his observed behaviour including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs \n clarification needed \n or on careless logical analysis or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice\" whereas the latter are \"the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information always reasoned with the greatest possible care and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice \" \n It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy \n The second caveat is that antisocial preferences such as sadism envy and resentment have to be excluded Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community \n Utilitarian ethics makes all of us members of the same moral community A person displaying ill will toward others does remain a member of this community but not with his whole personality That part of his personality that harbours these hostile antisocial feelings must be excluded from membership and has no claim for a hearing when it comes to defining our concept of social utility \n More varieties of utilitarianism \n Negative utilitarianism \n Negative utilitarianism \n In \n The Open Society and its Enemies \n Karl Popper \n argued that the principle \"maximize pleasure\" should be replaced by \"minimize pain\" He thought \"it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism \" \n He claimed that \n there is from the ethical point of view no symmetry between suffering and happiness or between pain and pleasure In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal namely the appeal for help while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula \"Maximize pleasure\" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure But from the moral point of view pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number one should demand more modestly the least amount of avoidable suffering for all \n The actual term \n negative utilitarianism \n was introduced by \n R N Smart \n as the title to his reply to Popper \n in which he argued that the principle would entail seeking the quickest and least painful method of killing the entirety of humanity \n Negative \n total \n utilitarianism in contrast tolerates suffering that can be compensated within the same person \n Negative \n preference \n utilitarianism avoids the problem of moral killing with reference to existing preferences that such killing would violate while it still demands a justification for the creation of new lives \n A possible justification is the reduction of the average level of preference-frustration \n Others see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness \n The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a \"compassionate\" utilitarian metric so that the result is the same as in \n prioritarianism \n Pessimistic representatives of negative utilitarianism can be found in the environment of \n Buddhism \n Motive utilitarianism \n Motive utilitarianism was first proposed by \n Robert Merrihew Adams \n in \n Whereas act utilitarianism requires us to choose our actions by calculating which action will maximize \n utility \n and rule utilitarianism requires us to implement rules which will on the whole maximize utility motive utilitarianism \"has the utility calculus being used to select motives and dispositions according to their general felicific effects and those motives and dispositions then dictate our choices of actions \" \n The arguments for moving to some form of motive utilitarianism at the personal level can be seen as mirroring the arguments for moving to some form of rule utilitarianism at the social level \n Adams refers to Sidgwick's observation that \"Happiness general as well as individual is likely to be better attained if the extent to which we set ourselves consciously to aim at it be carefully restricted \" \n Trying to apply the utility calculation on each and every occasion is likely to lead to a sub-optimal outcome Applying carefully selected rules at the social level and encouraging appropriate motives at the personal level is so it is argued likely to lead to a better overall outcome even if on some individual occasions it leads to the wrong action when assessed according to act utilitarian standards \n Adams concludes that \"right action by act-utilitarian standards and right motivation by motive-utilitarian standards are incompatible in some cases \" \n The necessity of this conclusion is rejected by \n Fred Feldman \n who argues that \"the conflict in question results from an inadequate formulation of the utilitarian doctrines motives play no essential role in it and that Precisely the same sort of conflict arises even when MU is left out of consideration and AU is applied by itself \" \n Instead \n Feldman \n proposes a variant of act utilitarianism that results in there being no conflict between it and motive utilitarianism \n Criticisms \n Because utilitarianism is not a single theory but a cluster of related theories that have been developed over two hundred years criticisms can be made for different reasons and have different targets \n Quantifying utility \n The main objection to utilitarianism is the inability to quantify compare or measure happiness or well-being Ray Briggs writes in the \n Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n One objection to this interpretation of utility is that there may not be a single good or indeed any good which rationality requires us to seek But if we understand utility broadly enough to include all potentially desirable endspleasure knowledge friendship health and so onit's not clear that there is a unique correct way to make the tradeoffs between different goods so that each outcome receives a utility There may be no good answer to the question of whether the life of an ascetic monk contains more or less good than the life of a happy libertinebut assigning utilities to these options forces us to compare them \n Utility understood this way is a \n personal preference \n in the absence of any objective measurement \n Utility ignores justice \n As Rosen \n has pointed out claiming that act utilitarians are not concerned about having rules is to set up a \"straw man\" Similarly \n Hare \n refers to \"the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with \" \n Given what Bentham says about second order evils \n it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good Nevertheless whether they would agree or not this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory A classic version of this criticism was given by H J McCloskey \n Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guilty and thus preventing serious anti-Negro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroesor of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the anti-Negro riots to occur while doing the best he can to combat them In such a case the sheriff if he were an extreme utilitarian would appear to be committed to framing the Negro \n By \"extreme\" utilitarian McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called \"act\" utilitarianism He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule \"do not punish an innocent person\" Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities \n In a later article McCloskey says \n Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be it is logically possible that an 'unjust' system of punishmente g a system involving collective punishments retroactive laws and punishments or punishments of parents and relations of the offendermay be more useful than a 'just' system of punishment? \n Predicting consequences \n Some argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable \n Daniel Dennett \n describes this as the \n Three Mile Island \n effect \n Dennett \n points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident it is impossible to know whether ultimately the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents \n Russell Hardin rejects such arguments He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism which is \"to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these\" from our ability to correctly apply rational principles which will among other things \"depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment \" \n The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected \"If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends it does not follow that we then must change our ethics The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding \" \n From the beginning utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the \n tendencies \n of actions to bring about consequences \n G E Moore \n writing in said \n We certainly cannot hope directly to compare their effects except within a limited future and all the arguments which have ever been used in Ethics and upon which we commonly act in common life directed to shewing that one course is superior to another are apart from theological dogmas confined to pointing out such probable immediate advantages \n An ethical law has the nature not of a scientific law but of a scientific \n prediction \n and the latter is always merely probable although the probability may be very great \n Demandingness objection \n Act utilitarianism not only requires everyone to do what they can to maximize utility but to do so without any favouritism Mill said \"As between his own happiness and that of others utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator \" \n Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends family or self \"What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them \" \n As Shelly Kagan says \"Given the parameters of the actual world there is no question that maximally promoting the good would require a life of hardship self-denial and austeritya life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed \" \n Hooker describes two aspects to the problem act utilitarianism requires \n huge \n sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only \n slightly \n increased \n Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism \"there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty \" \n Mill was quite clear about this \"A sacrifice which does not increase or tend to increase the sum total of happiness it considers as wasted \" \n One response to the problem is to accept its demands This is the view taken by Peter Singer who says \"No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us Few could stand by and watch a child drown many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India The question however is not what we usually do but what we ought to do and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance or community membership makes a crucial difference to our obligations \" \n Others argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified \n There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements \n One approach is to drop the demand that utility be maximized In \n Satisficing Consequentialism \n Michael Slote argues for a form of utilitarianism where \"an act might qualify as morally right through having good enough consequences even though better consequences could have been produced \" \n One advantage of such a system is that it would be able to accommodate the notion of supererogatory actions \n Samuel Scheffler takes a different approach and amends the requirement that everyone be treated the same \n In particular Scheffler suggests that there is an \"agent-centered prerogative\" such that when the overall utility is being calculated it is permitted to count our own interests more heavily than the interests of others Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that \"a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements\" and secondly that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that \"the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view \" \n Robert Goodin takes yet another approach and argues that the demandingness objection can be \"blunted\" by treating utilitarianism as a guide to public policy rather than one of individual morality He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share \n Harsanyi argues that the objection overlooks the fact that \"people attach considerable utility to freedom from unduly burdensome moral obligations most people will prefer a society with a more relaxed moral code and will feel that such a society will achieve a higher level of average utilityeven if adoption of such a moral code should lead to some losses in economic and cultural accomplishments so long as these losses remain within tolerable limits This means that utilitarianism if correctly interpreted will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard \" \n Aggregating utility \n The objection that \"utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons\" \n came to prominence in with the publication of \n John Rawls \n ' \n A Theory of Justice \n The concept is also important in \n animal rights \n advocate \n Richard Ryder \n 's rejection of utilitarianism in which he talks of the \"boundary of the individual\" through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass \n However a similar objection was noted in by \n Thomas Nagel \n who claimed that consequentialism \"treats the desires needs satisfactions and dissatisfactions of distinct persons as if they were the desires etc of a mass person\" \n and even earlier by David Gauthier who wrote that utilitarianism supposes \"that mankind is a super-person whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action But this is absurd Individuals have wants not mankind individuals seek satisfaction not mankind A person's satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction \" \n Thus the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals \n A response to this criticism is to point out that whilst seeming to resolve some problems it introduces others Intuitively there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account As Alastair Norcross has said \"suppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the buildingit is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number precisely because it is a larger number Can anyone who really considers the matter seriously honestly claim to believe that it is worse that one person die than that the entire sentient population of the universe be severely mutilated? Clearly not \" \n It may be possible to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility if it accepted that people can be influenced by \n empathy \n This position is advocated by \n Iain King \n who has \n suggested \n the evolutionary basis of empathy means humans can take into account the interests of other individuals but only on a one-to-one basis \"since we can only imagine ourselves in the mind of one other person at a time \" \n King uses this insight to \n adapt utilitarianism \n and it may help reconcile Bentham's philosophy with deontology and virtue ethics \n The philosopher John Taurek also argued that the idea of adding happiness or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant \n Taurek's basic concern comes down to this we cannot explain what it means to say that things would be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies \"I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind \" he wrote p He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures There isn't five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? \"Each person's potential loss has the same significance to me only as a loss to that person alone because by hypothesis I have an equal concern for each person involved I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss\" p \n Parfit \n and others \n have criticized Taurek's line and it continues to be discussed \n Calculating utility is self-defeating \n An early criticism which was addressed by Mill is that if time is taken to calculate the best course of action it is likely that the opportunity to take the best course of action will already have passed Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects \n namely the whole past duration of the human species During all that time mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions on which experience all the prudence as well as all the morality of life are dependentIt is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment \n More recently Hardin has made the same point \"It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense Lord Devlin notes 'if the reasonable man \" \n worked to rule \n \" by perusing to the point of comprehension every form he was handed the commercial and administrative life of the country would creep to a standstill \n ' \n \" \n It is such considerations that lead even act utilitarians to rely on \"rules of thumb\" as \n Smart \n has called them \n Karl Marx's criticism \n Karl Marx \n in \n Das Kapital \n criticises Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that different people have different joys \n Not even excepting our philosopher \n Christian Wolff \n in no time and in no country has the most homespun commonplace ever strutted about in so self-satisfied a way The principle of utility was no discovery of Bentham He simply reproduced in his dull way what \n Helvtius \n and other Frenchmen had said with esprit in the 18th century To know what is useful for a dog one must study dog-nature This nature itself is not to be deduced from the principle of utility Applying this to man he who would criticize all human acts movements relations etc by the principle of utility must first deal with human nature in general and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch Bentham makes short work of it With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper especially the English shopkeeper as the normal man Whatever is useful to this queer normal man and to his world is absolutely useful This yard-measure then he applies to past present and future The Christian religion e g is \"useful \" \"because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law \" Artistic criticism is \"harmful \" because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of \n Martin Tupper \n etc With such rubbish has the brave fellow with his motto \"nulla dies sine linea no day without a line \" piled up mountains of books \n John Paul II's personalist criticism \n Pope John Paul II \n following his \n personalist philosophy \n argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons just as much as things the object of use \"Utilitarianism \" he wrote \"is a civilization of production and of use a civilization of things and not of persons a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used \" \n Additional considerations \n Average v total happiness \n Average and total utilitarianism \n In \n The Methods of Ethics \n Henry Sidgwick \n asked \"Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?\" \n He noted that aspects of the question had been overlooked and answered the question himself by saying that what had to be maximized was the average multiplied by the number of people living \n He also argued that if the \"average happiness enjoyed remains undiminished Utilitarianism directs us to make the number enjoying it as great as possible \" \n This was also the view taken earlier by Paley He notes that although he speaks of the happiness of communities \"the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients or the pleasure of their perceptions\" and that if extreme cases such as people held as slaves are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people Consequently \"the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer and the improvement of it the object which ought in all countries to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever \" \n A similar view was expressed by Smart who argued that all other things being equal a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people \n Since Sidgwick raised the question it has been studied in detail and philosophers have argued that using either total or average happiness can lead to objectionable results \n According to \n Derek Parfit \n using total happiness falls victim to the \n repugnant conclusion \n whereby large numbers of people with very low but non-negative utility values can be seen as a better goal than a population of a less extreme size living in comfort In other words according to the theory it is a moral good to breed more people on the world for as long as total happiness rises \n On the other hand measuring the utility of a population based on the average utility of that population avoids \n Parfit's \n repugnant conclusion but causes other problems For example bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act aside from this the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average as this would raise the average happiness \n William Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people who need not concern us and actual future people who should concern us He says \"utilitarianism values the happiness of people not the production of units of happiness Accordingly one has no positive obligation to have children However if you have decided to have a child then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can \" \n Motives intentions and actions \n Utilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from intention and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain He adds that \"from every kind of motive may proceed actions that are good others that are bad and others that are indifferent \" \n Mill makes a similar point \n and explicitly says that \"motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action though much with the worth of the agent He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right whether his motive be duty or the hope of being paid for his trouble \" \n However with intention the situation is more complex In a footnote printed in the second edition of \n Utilitarianism \n Mill says \"the morality of the action depends entirely upon the intentionthat is upon what the agent wills to do \" \n Elsewhere he says \"Intention and motive are two very different things But it is the intention that is the foresight of consequences which constitutes the moral rightness or wrongness of the act \" \n The correct interpretation of Mill's footnote is a matter of some debate The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why since it is consequences that matter intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not One possibility \"involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent and its rightness or wrongness another \" \n Jonathan Dancy \n rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent \n An interpretation given by \n Roger Crisp \n draws on a definition given by Mill in \n A System of Logic \n where he says that an \"intention to produce the effect is one thing the effect produced in consequence of the intention is another thing the two together constitute the action \" \n Accordingly whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not \n A third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy he recognizes that this might not have been Mill's own view for Mill \"would not even allow that 'p & q' expresses a complex proposition He wrote in his \n System of Logic \n I iv of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive' that 'we might as well call a street a complex house as these two propositions a complex proposition' \" \n Finally whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness \n Humans alone or other sentient beings? \n Nonhuman animals \n Further information \n Speciesism \n and \n Animal welfare \n Peter Singer \n In \n An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation \n Bentham wrote \"the question is not Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?\" \n Mill's distinction between \n higher and lower pleasures \n might suggest that he gave more status to humans but in \n The Methods of Ethics \n philosopher Henry Sidgwick \n says \"We have next to consider who the 'all' are whose happiness is to be taken into account Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill and I believe by the Utilitarian school generally and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end as so conceived any pleasure of any sentient being \" \n Moreover John Stuart Mill himself in \n Whewell on Moral Philosophy \n defends Bentham's advocacy for animal rights calling it a 'noble anticipation' and writing \"Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man is that practice moral or immoral? And if exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness they do not with one voice answer 'immoral' let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned \" \n The utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer and many other \n animal rights activists \n have continued to argue that the well-being of all \n sentient \n beings ought to be seriously considered Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature's self-awareness regardless of their species He adds that humans tend to be \n speciesist \n discriminatory against non-humans in ethical matters and argues that on utilitarianism speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals all suffering ought to be reduced Singer writes \"The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species The pattern is the same in each case Most human beings are speciesists \" \n In his edition of \n Animal Liberation \n Peter Singer said that he no longer ate oysters and mussels because although the creatures might not suffer they might it's not really known and it's easy enough to avoid eating them in any case \n and this aspect of seeking better alternatives is a prominent part of utilitarianism \n This view still might be contrasted with \n deep ecology \n which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature whether currently assumed to be sentient or not According to utilitarianism the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer Singer writes \n The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare A mouse on the other hand does have an interest in not being tormented because it will suffer if it is If a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration No matter what the nature of the being the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like sufferingin so far as rough comparisons can be madeof any other being If a being is not capable of suffering or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness there is nothing to be taken into account \n Thus the moral value of one-celled organisms as well as some multi-cellular organisms and natural entities like a river is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings Similarly utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on \n biodiversity \n although the benefits that biodiversity bring to sentient beings may mean that on utilitarianism biodiversity ought to be maintained in general \n In John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Nature\" \n he argues that the \n welfare of wild animals \n is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments \n Tyler Cowen \n argues that if individual animals are carriers of utility then we should consider limiting the predatory activity of carnivores relative to their victims \"At the very least we should limit current subsidies to nature's carnivores \" \n AI \n AI \n 's may \n develop feelings \n become \n self-aware \n and be legally regarded as sentient beings \n Application to specific issues \n World poverty \n An article in the American journal for Economics has addressed the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services \n Many utilitarian philosophers including Peter Singer and \n Toby Ord \n argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity Peter Singer for example argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort However Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number consistent with utilitarian thinking \n Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern \n effective altruist \n movement \n Altruism ethical

there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder them from the way of Allah And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah announce unto them a most grievous penalty On the Day when heat will be produced out of that wealth in the fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads their flanks and their backs their flanks and their backs - \"This is the treasure which ye buried for yourselves taste ye then the treasures ye buried!\" The Holy Qur'an \n Muslims of each era have agreed upon the obligatory nature of paying Zakat for gold and silver and from those the other kinds of currency \n Zakat is obligatory when a certain amount of money called the nisab is reached or exceeded Zakat is not obligatory if the amount owned is less than this nisab The nisab or minimum amount of gold and golden currency is mithqal approximately 85grams of pure gold One mithqal is approximately 25grams The nisab of silver and silver currency is dirhams which is approximately 595grams of pure silver The nisab of other kinds of money and currency is to be scaled to that of gold the nisab of money is equivalent to the price of 85grams of 999-type pure gold on the day in which Zakat is paid \n Zakat is obligatory after the money has been in the control of its owner for the span of one lunar year Then the owner needs to pay 5% or 1/40 of the money as Zakat A lunar year is approximately days The owner should deduct any amount of money he or she borrowed from others then check if the rest reaches the necessary nisab then pays Zakat for it \n If the owner had enough money to satisfy the nisab at the beginning of the year but his wealth in any form increased the owner needs to add the increase to the nisab amount owned at the beginning of the year then pay Zakat 5% of the total at the end of the lunar year There are minor differences between fiqh school on how this is to be calculated Each Muslim calculates his or her own Zakat individually For most purposes this involves the payment each year of two and a half percent of one's capital \n A pious person may also give as much as he or she pleases as sadaqa and does so preferably in secret Although this word can be translated as 'voluntary charity' it has a wider meaning The Prophet said 'Even meeting your brother with a cheerful face is charity ' \n The Prophet said 'Charity is a necessity for every Muslim ' He was asked 'What if a person has nothing?' The Prophet replied 'He should work with his own hands for his benefit and then give something out of such earnings in charity ' The Companions asked 'What if he is not able to work?' The Prophet said 'He should help poor and needy persons ' The Companions further asked 'What if he cannot do even that?' The Prophet said 'He should urge others to do good ' The Companions said 'What if he lacks that also?' The Prophet said 'He should check himself from doing evil That is also charity ' \n Buddhism \n Dna \n Almsbowl as used by \n bhikkhus \n for going on almsround \n Three monks seeking alms in \n Lhasa \n Tibet \n In Buddhism alms or almsgiving is the respect given by a \n lay Buddhist \n to a Buddhist \n monk \n nun \n spiritually-developed person or other sentient being It is not charity as presumed by Western interpreters It is closer to a symbolic connection to the spiritual realm and to show humbleness and respect in the presence of the secular society \n note \n The act of alms giving assists in connecting the human to the monk or nun and what he/she represents As the Buddha has stated \n Householders & the homeless or charity monastics \n in mutual dependence \n both reach the true Dhamma \n Itivuttaka \n note \n In \n Theravada \n Buddhism nuns \n Pli \n bhikkhunis \n and monks \n Pli \n bhikkhus \n go on a daily almsround \n pindacara \n to collect food \n piapta \n This is often perceived as giving the laypeople the opportunity to make merit Pli \n pua \n Money cannot be accepted by a Theravadan Buddhist monk or nun in lieu of or in addition to food as the \n Patimokkha \n training rules make it an offence worth forfeiture and confession \n In countries that follow \n Mahayana \n Buddhism the practice of a daily alms round has mostly died out In China Korea and Japan local cultures resisted the idea of giving food to 'begging' clerics and there was no tradition of gaining 'merit' by donating to practitioners After periods of persecution monasteries

\n XXIV v \n note \n Christianity \n Alms bag taken from a \n tapestry \n in \n Orlans \n fifteenth century \n The giving of alms is an act of \n charity \n toward those less fortunate In the \n Apostolic age \n Christians were taught that giving alms was an expression of love which was first expressed by God to them in that Jesus sacrificed himself as an act of love for the salvation of believers \n The \n offertory \n is the traditional moment in \n Roman Catholic Mass \n Anglican Eucharist \n and \n Lutheran Divine Services \n when alms are collected Some Protestant groups such as \n Baptists \n or Methodists also engage in alms although it is more commonly referred to as \" \n tithes \n and offerings\" by the church Some fellowships practice regular giving for special purposes called \n Love Offerings \n for the poor destitute or victims of catastrophic loss such as home fires or medical expenses Traditionally Deacons and Deaconesses are responsible for distributing these gifts among widows orphans and others in need Many Christians support a plethora of charitable organizations not all of which claim a Christian religious affiliation Many American Educational and Medical Institutions were founded by Christian fellowships giving alms \n Collecting the Offering in a Scottish Kirk \n by \n John Phillip \n In the \n Eastern Orthodox Church \n and the \n Eastern Catholic Churches \n the collection of alms and tithes has not been formally united to the offertory in any liturgical action However either having a collection plate in the \n narthex \n or passing it unobtrusively during the service is not uncommon In \n Orthodox theology \n almsgiving is an important part of the spiritual life and \n fasting \n should always be accompanied by increased prayer and almsgiving \n Almsgiving in the name of the deceased also frequently accompanies \n prayer for the dead \n Those whose financial circumstances do not permit the giving of monetary alms may give alms in other ways such as \n intercessory prayer \n and \n acts of mercy \n In the majority of Christian forms of worship and denominations a collection of \"tithes and offerings\" is given for the support of the church's mission budget ministry and for its relief of the poor as an important act of Christian \n charity \n united to communal prayer In some churches the \"offering plate\" or \"offering basket\" is placed upon the \n altar \n as a sign that the offering is made to God and a sign of the bond of Christian love \n note \n In addition private acts of charity considered virtuous only if not done for others to admire are seen as a Christian duty \n Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' in front of others to be seen by them If you do you will have no reward from your Father in heaven \n Matthew \n The outward and an inward giving of alms \n Here Jesus places the primary focus on the motives behind such acts which should be love \n Rather give as alms what is inside and then everything will be clean for you! \n Luke \n Jesus commends this poor but generous woman \n Giving of the rich versus the poor \n Here Jesus contrasts the giving of the rich and the poor \n He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins And He said 'Truly I say to you this poor widow put in more than all of them for they all out of their surplus put into the offering but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on ' \n Luke \n Giving out of Love and not out of duty \n He will reply 'I tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me ' \n Matthew \n Hinduism \n Dna \n Lady giving alms at the Temple by \n Raja Ravi Varma \n Dna Sanskrit is an ancient concept of alms-giving dating to the \n Vedic period \n of Hinduism \n The word for alms in Vedic literature is \n Bhiksha \n The \n Rigveda \n has the earliest discussion of \n dna \n in the \n Vedas \n and offers reasons for the virtue of alms-giving \n The Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape \n The riches of the liberal never waste away while he who will not give finds none to comfort him \n The man with food in store who when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat \n Hardens his heart against him when of old finds not one to comfort him \n Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food and the feeble \n Success attends him in the shout of battle He makes a friend of him in future troubles \n No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food will offer nothing \n Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer and bend his eye upon a longer pathway \n Riches come now to one now to another and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling \n The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour that food I speak the truth shall be his ruin \n He feeds no trusty friend no man to love him All guilt is he who eats with no partaker \n Rigveda \n X \n The early \n Upanishads \n those composed before BCE also discuss the virtue of alms-giving \n Brihadaranyaka Upanishad \n in verse for example states that three characteristics of a good developed person are self-restraint damah compassion or love for all sentient life daya and charity dna \n Chandogya Upanishad \n Book III similarly states that a virtuous life requires \n tapas \n meditation asceticism \n dna \n charity \n arjava \n straightforwardness non-hypocrisy \n ahimsa \n non-violence non-injury to all sentinent beings and \n satyavacana \n truthfulness \n Bhagavad Gita \n describes the right and wrong forms of \n dna \n in verses through \n The \n Adi Parva \n of the Hindu Epic \n Mahabharata \n in Chapter states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means then embark on charity be hospitable to those who come to him never inflict pain on any living being and share a portion with others whatever he consumes \n In the \n Vana Parva \n Chapter the Mahabharata recommends that one must \"conquer the mean by charity the untruthful by truth the wicked by forgiveness and dishonesty by honesty\" \n The \n Bhagavata Purana \n discusses when dna is proper and when it is improper In Book Chapter verse it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of ones own Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the \n Puranas \n Dna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return \n While dna is typically given to one person or family Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit sometimes called \n utsarga \n This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house school drinking water or irrigation well planting trees and building care facility among others \n Ab Rayn al-Brn \n the 11th century Persian historian who visited and lived in India for years from about CE mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay He wrote \"It is obligatory with them Hindus every day to give alms as much as possible \" \n After the taxes there are different opinions on how to spend their income Some destine one-ninth of it for alms \n Others divide this income after taxes into four portions One fourth is destined for common expenses the second for liberal works of a noble mind the third for alms and the fourth for being kept in reserve \n Ab Rayn al-Brn Tarikh Al-Hind 11th century AD \n Alms-giving is held as a noble deed in Hinduism to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity \n Some texts reason referring to the nature of social life that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the \n reciprocity principle \n Other Hindu texts such as \n Vyasa Samhita \n state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dna is a virtue in itself as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives \n The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient Dna thus is a \n dharmic \n act requires idealistic-normative approach and has spiritual and philosophical context \n Some medieval era authors state that \n dna \n is best done with \n shraddha \n faith which is defined as being in good will cheerful welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without \n anasuya \n finding faults in the recipient \n These scholars of Hinduism states Kohler suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight a sense of \"unquestioning hospitality\" where the \n dna \n ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view \n Satrams \n also called \n Dharamsala \n or \n Chathrams \n in parts of India have been one means of alms-giving in Hinduism Satrams are shelters rest house for travelers and the poor with many serving water and free food These were usually established along the roads connecting major \n Hindu temple \n sites in south Asia as well as near major temples \n Hindu temples \n have served as institutions for alms-giving \n The \n dna \n the temples received from Hindus were used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation \n Other forms of alms-giving in Hinduism includes donating means of economic activity and food source For example Go Dna donation of a cow \n Bhu Dna donation of land and \n Vidya Dna \n or \n Jana \n Dna gift of knowledge and skills \n Aushadh Dna \n Charity of care for the sick and diseased \n Abhay Dna \n Giving freedom from fear asylum protection to someone facing imminent injury and \n Anna Dna \n Giving food to the poor needy and all visitors \n Between giving food and giving knowledge Hindu texts suggest the gift of knowledge is superior \n Bhiksha \n Freegan \n Mendicant \n Meshulach \n Qard al-Hassan \n Notes \n ^ \n Indicative of the mutual nature of the almsgiving exchange in some Theravada countries if a monk were to refuse alms from someonea gesture known as \"turning over the rice bowl\"this would be interpreted as an act of

evolution \n Level of support \n Evolutionary biology portal \n Category \n Book \n Related topics \n v \n t \n e \n In \n evolutionary biology \n inclusive fitness is one of two metrics of evolutionary success as defined by \n W D Hamilton \n in \n Personal fitness \n is the number of offspring than an individual begets regardless of who rescues/rears/supports them \n Inclusive fitness \n is the number of offspring equivalents that an individual rears rescues or otherwise supports through its behaviour regardless of who begets them \n An individual's own child who carries one half of the individual's genes is defined as one offspring equivalent A sibling's child who will carry one-quarter of the individual's genes is 1/2 offspring equivalent Similarly a cousin's child who has 1/16 of the individual's genes is 1/8 offspring equivalent \n From the gene's point of view \n evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the \n population \n Prior to Hamilton's work it was generally assumed that genes only achieved this through the number of viable offspring produced by the individual organism they occupied However this overlooked a wider consideration of a gene's success most clearly in the case of the \n social insects \n where the vast majority of individuals do not produce offspring \n Overview \n Hamilton's rule \n Altruism \n Green-beard effects \n Parental care \n Parent offspring conflict and optimization \n Criticism \n Sources \n Overview \n Hamilton showed mathematically that because other members of a population may share one's genes a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by indirectly promoting the reproduction and survival of other individuals who also carry that gene This is variously called \"kin theory\" \"kin selection theory\" or \"inclusive fitness theory\" The most obvious category of such individuals is close genetic relatives and where these are concerned the application of inclusive fitness theory is often more straightforwardly treated via the narrower \n kin selection \n theory \n Hamilton's theory alongside \n reciprocal altruism \n is considered one of the two primary mechanisms for the evolution of social behaviors in natural species and a major contribution to the field of \n sociobiology \n which holds that some behaviors can be dictated by genes and therefore can be passed to future generations and may be selected for as the organism evolves \n Although described in seemingly anthropomorphic terms these ideas apply to all living things and can describe the evolution of innate and learned behaviors over a wide range of species including insects small mammals or humans \n Belding's ground squirrel \n provides an example The ground squirrel gives an alarm call to warn its local group of the presence of a predator By emitting the alarm it gives its own location away putting itself in more danger In the process however the squirrel may protect its relatives within the local group along with the rest of the group Therefore if the effect of the trait influencing the alarm call typically protects the other squirrels in the immediate area it will lead to the passing on of more copies of the alarm call trait in the next generation than the squirrel could leave by reproducing on its own In such a case \n natural selection \n will increase the trait that influences giving the alarm call provided that a sufficient fraction of the shared genes include the gene s predisposing to the alarm call \n Synalpheus regalis \n a \n eusocial \n shrimp \n also is an example of an organism whose social traits meet the inclusive fitness criterion The larger defenders protect the young juveniles in the colony from outsiders By ensuring the young's survival the genes will continue to be passed on to future generations \n Inclusive fitness is more generalized than strict \n kin selection \n which requires that the shared genes are \n identical by descent \n Inclusive fitness is not limited to cases where \"kin\" 'close genetic relatives' are involved \n Hamilton's rule \n In the context of sociobiology Hamilton proposed that inclusive fitness offers a mechanism for the evolution of altruism He claimed that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that behave in ways that correlate with maximizing their inclusive fitness If a gene or gene complex promoting altruistic behavior has copies of itself in others helping those others survive ensures that the genes will be passed on \n Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population \n c \n < \n r \n b \n { displaystyle c<rb } \n where \n r \n { displaystyle r } \n is the probability above the population average of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene commonly viewed as \"degree of relatedness\" \n b \n { displaystyle b } \n is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior and \n c \n { displaystyle c } \n is the reproductive cost to the altruist \n Gardner \n et al \n suggest that Hamilton's rule can be applied to multi-locus models but that it should be done at the point of interpreting theory rather than the starting point of enquiry \n They suggest that one should \"use standard population genetics game theory or other methodologies to derive a condition for when the social trait of interest is favored by selection and then use Hamilton's rule as an aid for conceptualizing this result\" \n Altruism \n Human inclusive fitness \n The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate \n altruism \n If there is an \"altruism gene\" or complex of genes that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to \n common descent \n In formal terms if such a complex of genes arises Hamilton's rule rb>c specifies the selective criteria in terms of cost benefit and relatedness for such a trait to increase in frequency in the population Hamilton noted that inclusive fitness theory \n does not by itself predict \n that a species will necessarily evolve such altruistic behaviors since an opportunity or context for interaction between individuals is a more primary and necessary requirement in order for any social interaction to occur in the first place As Hamilton put it \" \n Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start \n \" Hamilton \n In other words whilst inclusive fitness theory specifies a set of necessary criteria for the evolution of altruistic traits it does not specify a sufficient condition for their evolution in any given species More primary necessary criteria include the existence of gene complexes for altruistic traits in gene pool as mentioned above and especially that \"a suitable social object is available\" as Hamilton noted Paul Sherman who has contributed much research on the ground squirrels mentioned above gives a fuller discussion of Hamilton's latter point \n To understand any species' pattern of nepotism two questions about individuals' behavior must be considered what is reproductively ideal? and what is socially possible? With his formulation of \"inclusive fitness \" Hamilton suggested a mathematical way of answering Here I suggest that the answer to depends on demography particularly its spatial component dispersal and its temporal component mortality Only when ecological circumstances affecting demography consistently make it socially possible will nepotism be elaborated according to what is reproductively ideal For example if dispersing is advantageous and if it usually separates relatives permanently as in many birds Nice 180-187 Gross Robertson on the rare occasions when nestmates or other kin live in proximity they will not preferentially cooperate Similarly nepotism will not be elaborated among relatives that have infrequently coexisted in a population's or a species' evolutionary history If an animal's life history characteristics Stearns Warner this volume usually preclude the existence of certain relatives that is if kin are usually unavailable the rare coexistence of such kin will not occasion preferential treatment For example if reproductives generally die soon after zygotes are formed as in many temperate zone insects the unusual individual that survives to interact with its offspring is not expected to behave parentally Sherman underlining in original \n The occurrence of sibling cannibalism in several species \n underlines the point that inclusive fitness theory should not be understood to simply predict that genetically related individuals will inevitably recognize and engage in positive social behaviors towards genetic relatives Only in species that have the appropriate traits in their gene pool and in which individuals typically interacted with genetic relatives in the natural conditions of their evolutionary history will social behavior potentially be elaborated and consideration of the evolutionarily typical demographic composition of grouping contexts of that species is thus a first step in understanding how selection pressures upon inclusive fitness have shaped the forms of its social behavior Dawkins gives a simplified illustration \n If families genetic relatives happen to go around in groups this fact provides a useful rule of thumb for kin selection 'care for any individual you often see' \" Dawkins \n Evidence from a variety of species \n including \n humans \n primates \n and other social mammals \n suggests that contextual cues such as familiarity are often significant proximate mechanisms mediating the expression of altruistic behavior regardless of whether the participants are always in fact genetic relatives or not This is nevertheless evolutionarily stable since selection pressure acts on the \n typical conditions \n not on \n the rare occasions \n where actual genetic relatedness differs from that normally encountered \n see Sherman above \n Inclusive fitness theory thus does not imply that \n organisms evolve to direct altruism towards genetic relatives \n Many popular treatments do however promote this interpretation as illustrated in a recent review \n M any misunderstandings persist In many cases they result from conflating \"coefficient of relatedness\" and \"proportion of shared genes \" which is a short step from the intuitively appealingbut incorrectinterpretation that \"animals tend to be altruistic toward those with whom they share a lot of genes \" These misunderstandings don't just crop up occasionally they are repeated in many writings including undergraduate psychology textbooksmost of them in the field of social psychology within sections describing evolutionary approaches to altruism Park p860 \n Such misunderstandings of inclusive fitness' implications for the study of altruism even amongst professional biologists utilizing the theory are widespread prompting prominent theorists to regularly attempt to highlight and clarify the mistakes \n Here is one recent example of attempted clarification from West et al \n In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two wayskin discrimination or limited dispersal Hamilton There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt & Bever and West et al 2002a as well as experimental evolution tests of these models Diggle et al Griffin et al Kmmerli et al However despite this it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination Oates & Wilson Silk Furthermore a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives T here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination misconception despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory Hamilton Hamilton Hamilton Hamilton West et al p and supplement \n Green-beard effects \n Kin recognition \n As well as interactions in reliable contexts of genetic relatedness altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them As Dawkins points out in \n The Selfish Gene \n Chapter and \n The Extended Phenotype \n this must be distinguished from the \n green-beard effect \n The green-beard effect is the act of a gene or several closely linked gene that \n Produces a phenotype \n Allows recognition of that phenotype in others \n Causes the individual to preferentially treat other individuals with the same gene \n The green-beard effect was originally a thought experiment by Hamilton in his publications on inclusive fitness in \n although it hadn't yet been observed As of today it has been observed in few species Its rarity is probably due to its susceptibility to 'cheating' whereby individuals can gain the trait that confers the advantage without the altruistic behavior This normally would occur via the crossing over of chromosomes which happens frequently often rendering the green-beard effect a transient state However Wang et al \n has shown in one of the species where the effect is common fire ants recombination cannot occur due to a large genetic transversion essentially forming a supergene This along with homozygote inviability at the green-beard loci allows for the extended maintenance of the green-beard effect \n Equally cheaters may not be able to invade the green-beard population if the mechanism for preferential treatment and the phenotype are intrinsically linked In budding yeast \n Saccharomyces cerevisiae \n the dominant allele FLO1 is responsible for flocculation self-adherence between cells which helps protect them against harmful substances such as ethanol While 'cheater' yeast cells occasionally find their way into the biofilm-like substance that is formed from FLO1 expressing yeast they cannot invade as the FLO1 expressing yeast will not bind to them in return and thus the phenotype is intrinsically linked to the preference \n Parental care \n This section \n possibly contains \n original research \n Please \n improve it \n by \n verifying \n the claims made and adding \n inline citations \n Statements consisting only of original research should be removed \n August \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n In \n The Selfish Gene \n Dawkins reported that some question the idea that parental investment parental care contributes to inclusive fitness The distinctions between the kind of beneficiaries nurtured collateral versus descendant relatives and the kind of fitnesses used inclusive versus personal in the parsing of nature are independent concepts This orthogonality can best be understood in a thought experiment Consider a model of a population of animals such as \n crocodiles \n or \n tangle web spiders \n Some species or populations of these spiders and reptiles exhibit parental care while closely related species or populations lack it Assume that in these animals a gene called a codes for parental care and its other allele called A codes for an absence thereof The aa homozygotes care for their young and AA homozygotes don't and the heterozygotes behave like aa homozygotes if a is dominant and like AA homozygotes if A is dominant or exhibit some kind of intermediate behavior if there is partial dominance Other kinds of animals could be considered in which all individuals exhibit parental care but variation among them would be in the quantity and quality thereof \n If one considers a life cycle as extending from conception to conception and an animal is an offspring of parents with poor parental care then the higher mortality with poor care could be considered a diminution of the offspring's expected fitness \n Alternatively if one considers the life cycle as extending from weaning to weaning the same mortality would be considered a diminution in the parents' fecundity and therefore a diminution of the parent's fitness \n In Hamilton's paradigm fitnesses calculated according to in the weaning-to-weaning perspective are inclusive fitnesses and fitnesses calculated in the conception-to-conception perspective are personal fitnesses This distinction is independent of whether the altruism involved in child rearing is toward descendants or toward collateral relatives as when aunts and uncle rear their nieces and nephews \n Inclusive fitness theory was developed in order to better understand collateral altruism but this does not mean that it is limited to collateral altruism It applies just as well to parental care Which perspective one chooses does not affect the animals but just one's understanding \n Parent offspring conflict and optimization \n Early writings on inclusive fitness theory including Hamilton used K in place of B/C Thus Hamilton's rule was expressed as \n K \n > \n / \n r \n { displaystyle K>1/r} \n is the necessary and sufficient condition for selection for altruism \n Where B is the gain to the beneficiary C is the cost to the actor and r is the number of its own offspring equivalents the actor expects in one of the offspring of the beneficiary r is either called the coefficient of relatedness or coefficient of relationship depending on how it is computed The method of computing has changed over time as has the terminology It is not clear whether or not changes in the terminology followed changes in computation \n Robert L Trivers defined \"parent-offspring conflict\" as any case where \n < \n K \n < \n { displaystyle 1<K<2} \n i e K is between and The benefit is greater than the cost but is less than twice the cost \n In this case the parent would wish the offspring to behave as if r is between siblings although it is actually presumed to be 1/2 or closely approximated by 1/2 \n In other words a parent would wish its offspring to give up ten offspring in order to raise nieces and nephews The offspring when not manipulated by the parent would require at least nieces and nephews to justify the sacrifice of of its own offspring \n The parent is trying to maximize its number of grandchildren while the offspring is trying to maximize the number of its own offspring equivalents via offspring and nieces and nephews it produces If the parent cannot manipulate the offspring and therefore loses in the conflict the grandparents with the fewest grandchildren seem to be selected for In other words if the parent has no influence on the offspring's behavior grandparents with fewer grandchildren increase in frequency in the population \n By extension parents with the fewest offspring will also increase in frequency \n This seems to go against Ronald A Fisher's \"Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection\" which states that the change in fitness over the course of a generation equals the variance in fitness at the beginning of the generation Variance is defined as the square of a quantity standard deviation and as a square must always be positive or zero That would imply that e fitness could never decrease as time passes This goes along with the intuitive idea that you can't select for lower fitness \n During parent-offspring conflict the number of stranger equivalents reared per offspring equivalents reared is going down \n It is considerations of this phenomenon that have caused Orlove and Grafen to say that nothing is being maximized \n According to Trivers if Freud had tried to explain intra-family conflict after Hamilton instead of before him he would have attributed the motivation for the conflict and for the <castration complex> to resource allocation issues rather than sexual jealousy \n Incidentally when k=1 or k=2 the average number of offspring per parent stays constant as time goes by When k<1 or k>2 then the average number of offspring per parent increases as time goes by \n The term \"gene\" can refer to a locus location on an organism's DNAa section that codes for a particular trait Alternative versions of the code at that location are called \"alleles \" If there are two alleles at a locus one of which codes for altruism and the other for selfishness an individual who has one of each is said to be a heterozygote at that locus If the heterozygote uses half of its resources raising its own

\n Cows on \n Selsley Common \n The \"tragedy of the commons\" is one way of accounting for \n overexploitation \n The \n tragedy of the commons \n is a term used in \n social science \n to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action The concept and phrase originated in an essay written in by the British economist \n William Forster Lloyd \n who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on \n common land \n also known as a \"common\" in the British Isles \n The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher \n Garrett Hardin \n in \n In this modern economic context \n commons \n is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as \n atmosphere \n oceans \n rivers \n fish stocks \n or even an office refrigerator \n It has been argued that the very term 'tragedy of the Commons' is a misnomer since 'the commons' referred to land resources with rights jointly owned by members of a community and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource However the term is now used in social science and economics when describing a problem where \n all \n individuals have equal and open access to a resource Hence 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms \n ' \n The 'tragedy of the commons' is often cited in connection with \n sustainable development \n meshing economic growth and environmental protection as well as in the \n debate over global warming \n It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of \n economics \n evolutionary psychology \n anthropology \n game theory \n politics \n taxation \n and \n sociology \n Although common resource systems have been known to collapse due to overuse such as in \n over-fishing \n many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with access to a common resource co-operate or regulate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse \n Expositions \n Lloyd's pamphlet \n Garrett Hardin's article \n The \"Commons\" as a modern resource concept \n Application \n Metaphoric meaning \n Modern commons \n Examples \n

Forster Lloyd \n published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze as was the custom in English villages He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common \n overgrazing \n could result For each additional animal a herder could receive additional benefits but the whole group shared damage to the commons If all herders made this individually rational economic decision the common could be depleted or even destroyed to the detriment of all \n Garrett Hardin's article \n The Tragedy of the Commons \n Presented \n December \n Location \n Science \n Author s \n Garrett Hardin \n Media type \n Article \n In \n ecologist \n Garrett Hardin \n explored this \n social dilemma \n in his article \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" published in the journal \n Science \n The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by Lloyd which he cites on the over-grazing of common land \n Hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means as distinct from those with solutions that require \"a change only in the techniques of the \n natural sciences \n demanding little or nothing in the way of change in \n human values \n or ideas of \n morality \n \" Hardin focused on human population growth the use of the Earth's \n natural resources \n and the welfare state \n Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone and not on the relationship of society and man then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom \n Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death if overbreeding was its own punishment then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families \n Hardin blamed the \n welfare state \n for allowing the tragedy of the commons where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right \n Malthusian catastrophe \n is inevitable Consequently in his article Hardin lamented the following proposal from the \n United Nations \n The \n Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society Article \n It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself and cannot be made by anyone else \n U Thant \n Statement on Population by the \n Secretary-General of the United Nations \n In addition Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others all resources would still eventually be depleted Overall Hardin argued against relying on \n conscience \n as a means of policing commons suggesting that this favors \n selfish \n individuals often known as \n free riders \n over those who are more altruistic \n In the context of avoiding \n over-exploitation \n of \n common resources \n Hardin concluded by restating \n Hegel \n 's \n maxim \n which was quoted by \n Engels \n \"freedom is the recognition of necessity\" He suggested that \"freedom\" completes the tragedy of the commons By recognizing resources as commons in the first place and by recognizing that as such they require management Hardin believed that humans \"can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms\" \n The \"Commons\" as a modern resource concept \n Hardin's article was the start of the modern use of \"Commons\" as a term connoting a shared resource As Frank van Laerhoven & Elinor Ostrom have stated \"Prior to the publication of Hardins article on the tragedy of the commons titles containing the words 'the commons' 'common pool resources ' or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature \" They go on to say \"In Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology They report that Hardins article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited\" \n Application \n Metaphoric meaning \n Like Lloyd and \n Thomas Malthus \n before him Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of \n human population growth \n But in his essay he also focused on the use of larger though finite resources such as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans as well as pointing out the \"negative commons\" of pollution i e instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource a \"negative commons\" deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost pollution \n As a \n metaphor \n the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally The \"tragedy\" is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it Similarly Hardin's use of \"commons\" has frequently been misunderstood leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work \"The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons\" \n The metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through \n over-exploitation \n temporarily or permanently This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it This in turn causes demand for the resource to increase which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses even if it retains a capacity to recover The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors the number of users wanting to consume the common in question the consumptiveness of their uses and the relative robustness of the common \n The same concept is sometimes called the \"tragedy of the fishers\" because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet \n Modern commons \n The \n tragedy of the commons \n can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as \n sustainability \n The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today such as water forests \n fish and \n non-renewable energy \n sources such as oil and coal \n Situations exemplifying the \"tragedy of the commons\" include the overfishing and destruction of the \n Grand Banks \n the destruction of \n salmon \n runs on rivers that have been dammed most prominently in modern times on the \n Columbia River \n in the \n Northwest United States \n and historically in \n North Atlantic \n rivers the devastation of the sturgeon fishery in modern Russia but historically in the United States as well and in terms of water supply the limited water available in arid regions e g the area of the \n Aral Sea \n and the \n Los Angeles \n water system supply especially at \n Mono Lake \n and \n Owens Lake \n In economics an \n externality \n is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the \"tragedy of the commons\" For example driving cars has many negative externalities these include \n pollution \n carbon emissions \n and traffic accidents Every time 'Person A' gets in a car it becomes more likely that 'Person Z' and millions of others will suffer in each of those areas \n Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that \"internalize\" an externality \n Examples \n More general examples some alluded to by Hardin of potential and actual tragedies include \n Clearing rainforest for agriculture in southern Mexico \n Planet \n Earth \n ecology \n Uncontrolled human \n population growth \n leading to \n overpopulation \n A preference for sons made people abort \n foetal \n girls This results in an imbalanced gender ratio \n Air \n whether ambient air polluted by industrial emissions and cars among other sources of \n air pollution \n or \n indoor air \n Water \n Water pollution \n water crisis \n of over-extraction of groundwater and wasting water due to \n overirrigation \n Forests \n Frontier \n logging \n of \n old growth forest \n and \n slash and burn \n Energy resources \n and \n climate \n Environmental residue of mining and drilling Burning of \n fossil fuels \n and consequential \n global warming \n Animals \n Habitat destruction \n and \n poaching \n leading to the \n Holocene mass extinction \n Human and wildlife conflict \n Oceans \n Overfishing \n Antibiotics \n Antibiotic Resistance \n Mis-use of antibiotics anywhere in the world will eventually result in antibiotic resistance developing at an accelerated rate The resulting antibiotic resistance has spread and will likely continue to do so in the future to other bacteria and other regions hurting or destroying the Antibiotic Commons that is shared on a worldwide basis \n Publicly shared resources \n Spam email \n degrades the usefulness of the email system and increases the cost for all users of the Internet while providing a benefit to only a tiny number of individuals \n Vandalism \n and \n littering \n in public spaces such as \n parks \n recreation areas \n and \n public restrooms \n Knowledge commons \n encompass immaterial and collectively owned goods in the information age \n Including for example \n source code \n and \n software \n documentation \n in software projects that can get \"polluted\" with messy code or inaccurate information \n Skills acquisition and training when all parties involved \n pass the buck \n on implementing it \n Application to evolutionary biology \n A parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host \n The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of \n virulence \n or \n sexual conflict \n where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings \n It is also raised as a question in studies of social insects where scientists wish to understand why insect workers do not undermine the \"common good\" by laying eggs of their own and causing a breakdown of the society \n The idea of \n evolutionary suicide \n where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven \n extinct \n can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons \n From an evolutionary point of view the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide us with advanced therapeutic methods \n Commons dilemma \n The \n commons dilemma \n is a specific class of \n social dilemma \n in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the \n common good \n In academia a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it including \n resource dilemma \n take-some dilemma \n and \n common pool resource \n Commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or \n over-harvest \n common resources in both the laboratory and field Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational strategic and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons \n In \n game theory \n which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations the corresponding \"game\" developed by Hardin is known as the Commonize Costs Privatize Profits Game \n CCPP game \n Psychological factors \n Kopelman Weber & Messick in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas social motives gender payoff structure uncertainty power and status group size communication causes and frames They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences stable personality traits and situational factors the environment Situational factors include both the task social and decision structure and the perception of the task \n Empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables \n Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework \n An expanded four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness \n suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question \"What does a person like me identity do rules in a situation like this recognition given this culture group ?\" \n Strategic factors \n Strategic \n factors also matter in commons dilemmas One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource In simultaneous play all people harvest at the same time whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence first second third etc There is a clear order effect in the latter games the harvests of those who come first the leaders are higher than the harvest of those coming later the followers The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more With sequential play individuals adopt a first come-first served rule whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations Research \n by whom? \n found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations Moreover those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group \n Structural factors \n Much research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that \"Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all \" \n One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task Groups prefer leaders who are elected democratic and prototypical of the group and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation A general aversion to autocratic \n leadership \n exists although it may be an effective solution possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption \n The provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation for example through installing water and electricity meters in houses Selective rewards work provided that they are open to everyone An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool \n The rewards do not have to be tangible In Canada utilities considered putting \"smiley faces\" on electricity bills of customers below the average consumption of that customer`s neighborhood \n Solutions \n Externality Possible solutions \n Articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of \n political philosophy \n In many situations locals implement often complex social schemes that work well The best governmental solution may be to do nothing When these fail there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization internalizing the externalities and regulation \n Non-governmental solution \n Sometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing \n Robert Axelrod \n contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests \n Anthropologist G N Appell criticized those who cited Hardin to \"impos e their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge \" \n Political scientist \n Elinor Ostrom \n who was awarded 2009's \n Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \n for her work on the issue and others revisited Hardin's work in \n They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves \n For example it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland In general it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency \n Similarly geographer Douglas L Johnson remarks that many \n nomadic pastoralist \n societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact \"balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound\" reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit in spite of this it was often the case that \"the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces \" \n Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as \n Ibn Khaldun \n as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples \n governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual \n sedentarization \n of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis Examining relations between historically nomadic \n Bedouin \n Arabs and the \n Syrian \n state in the 20th century \n Dawn Chatty \n notes that \"Hardin's argument was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the \n steppe \n land\" in development schemes for the arid interior of the country downplaying the larger role of agricultural \n overexploitation \n in \n desertification \n as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful \n Elinor Ostrom \n and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources such as fisheries land irrigation systems and farmlands and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management One factor is the resource itself resources with definable boundaries e g land can be preserved much more easily A second factor is resource dependence there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion and it must be difficult to find substitutes The third is the presence of a community small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better \n A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse When the commons is taken over by non-locals those solutions can no longer be used \n Governmental solutions \n Governmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network Examples of government regulation include privatization regulation and internalizing the externalities \n Privatization \n One solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability \n Libertarians \n and \n classical liberals \n cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when \n Lockean \n property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government \n They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource that is to privatize it \n Regulation \n In a typical example governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining fishing hunting livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach Similarly limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons This idea is used by the \n United Nations \n Moon Treaty \n Outer Space Treaty \n and \n Law of the Sea Treaty \n as well as the \n UNESCO \n World Heritage Convention \n which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the \n Common Heritage of Mankind \n In Hardin's essay he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on \"mutual coercion mutually agreed upon\" and result in \"relinquishing the freedom to breed\" Hardin discussed this topic further in a book \n Managing the Commons \n co-written with \n John A Baden \n He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the \" \n reproductive right \n \" to safeguard all other \n rights \n Several countries have a variety of \n population control laws \n in place \n German historian \n Joachim Radkau \n thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies \n An asserted impending \"tragedy of the commons\" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict \n private property \n and espouse expansion of public property \n Internalizing externalities \n Privatization works when the person who owns the property or rights of access to that property pays the full price of its exploitation As discussed above negative externalities negative results such as air or water pollution that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons \n Internalizing the externalities \n in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed \n Criticism \n The environmentalist \n Derrick Jensen \n claims the tragedy of the commons is used as \n propaganda \n for \n private ownership \n He says it has been used by the political \n right wing \n to hasten the final enclosure of the \"common resources\" of \n third world \n and indigenous people worldwide as a part of the \n Washington Consensus \n He argues that in true situations those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them He says that rather than being called \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" it should be called \"the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons\" \n Hardin's work was also criticised \n as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the \n demographic transition \n and for failing to distinguish between \n common property \n and \n open access \n resources \n In a similar vein Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing \n Likewise Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground and misrepresents what she terms was actually the \"triumph of the commons\" the successful common usage of land for many centuries She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation and not the behaviour of the commoners led to the demise of the commons \n Some authors like \n Yochai Benkler \n say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation an economics system based on commons becomes possible again He wrote in his book \n The Wealth of Networks \n in that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction \"as human beings and as social beings rather than as market actors through the price system\" He uses the term 'networked \n information economy \n ' to describe a \"system of production distribution and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies \" \n He also coined the term ' \n commons-based peer production \n ' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information \n Examples of commons-based peer production are \n free and open source software \n and \n open-source hardware \n Comedy of the Commons \n In certain cases exploiting a resource more may be a good thing Carol M Rose in an article discussed the concept of the \"comedy of the commons\" where the public property in question exhibits \"increasing returns to scale\" in usage hence the phrase \"the more the merrier\" in that the more people use the resource the higher the benefit to each one Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities According to Rose public resources with the \"comedic\" characteristic

\n is a standard example of a game analyzed in \n game theory \n that shows why two completely \n rational \n individuals might not cooperate even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so It was originally framed by \n Merrill Flood \n and \n Melvin Dresher \n while working at \n RAND \n in \n Albert W Tucker \n formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it \"prisoner's dilemma\" Poundstone presenting it as follows \n Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge They hope to get both sentenced to a year in prison on a lesser charge Simultaneously the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent The offer is \n If A and B each betray the other each of them serves years in prison \n If A betrays B but B remains silent A will be set free and B will serve years in prison and vice versa \n If A and B both remain silent both of them will only serve year in prison on the lesser charge \n It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other \n The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent In reality humans display a \n systemic bias \n towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of \"rational\" self-interested action \n Another model based on a different kind of rationality exists in which people forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then maximized their forecasts This model has been shown to make better predictions concerning the rate of cooperation in this and similar games given only the payoffs of the game \n An extended \"iterated\" version of the game also exists In this version the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players then by \n backward induction \n two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly for the same reasons as the single-shot variant In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases \n The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many \n real world situations \n involving cooperative behavior In casual usage the label \"prisoner's dilemma\" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games for instance those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so but find it difficult or expensivenot necessarily impossibleto coordinate their activities \n Strategy for

Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma \n Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other The normal game is shown below \n Prisoner B \n Prisoner A \n Prisoner B stays silent \n cooperates \n Prisoner B betrays \n defects \n Prisoner A stays silent \n cooperates \n Each serves year \n Prisoner A years \n Prisoner B goes free \n Prisoner A betrays \n defects \n Prisoner A goes free \n Prisoner B years \n Each serves years \n It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game have no loyalty to each other and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game Regardless of what the other decides each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other \"defecting\" The reasoning involves an argument by \n dilemma \n B will either cooperate or defect If B cooperates A should defect because going free is better than serving year If B defects A should also defect because serving years is better than serving So either way A should defect Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect \n Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice it is a \n dominant strategy \n Mutual defection is the only strong \n Nash equilibrium \n in the game i e the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy The dilemma then is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate from a self-interested perspective is irrational \n Generalized form \n The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors red and blue and that each player chooses to either \"Cooperate\" or \"Defect\" \n If both players cooperate they both receive the reward \n R \n for cooperating If both players defect they both receive the

an apple to the orange-grower X is \n b \n which is higher than the marginal utility \n c \n of an orange since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples Similarly for apple-grower Y the marginal utility of an orange is \n b \n while the marginal utility of an apple is \n c \n If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange and each fulfills their end of the deal then each receive a payoff of \n b \n - \n c \n If one \"defects\" and does not deliver as promised the defector will receive a payoff of \n b \n while the cooperator will lose \n c \n If both defect then neither one

succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma \n In addition to the general form above the iterative version also requires that \n R \n > \n T \n + \n S \n to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation \n The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player iterated version of the game It has consequently fascinated many scholars over the years In Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the \" \n Peace-War game \n \" \n If the game is played exactly \n N \n times and both players know this then it is always game theoretically optimal to defect in all rounds The only possible \n Nash equilibrium \n is to always defect The proof is \n inductive \n one might as well defect on the last turn since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate Therefore both will defect on the last turn Thus the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done and so on The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit \n Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players Within standard economic theory though this is the only correct answer The \n superrational \n strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed \n N \n is to cooperate against a superrational opponent and in the limit of large \n N \n experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version not the game-theoretic rational one \n For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players the total number of rounds \n N \n must be unknown to the players In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy only a Nash equilibrium Amongst results shown by \n Robert Aumann \n in a paper rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome \n Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma \n Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma IPD was kindled by \n Robert Axelrod \n in his book \n The Evolution of Cooperation \n In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the \n N \n step prisoner's dilemma with \n N \n fixed in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again and have memory of their previous encounters Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity initial hostility capacity for forgiveness and so forth \n Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players each with different strategies greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more \n altruistic \n strategies did better as judged purely by self-interest He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish by \n natural selection \n The winning \n deterministic \n strategy was \n tit for tat \n which \n Anatol Rapoport \n developed and entered into the tournament It was the simplest of any program entered containing only four lines of \n BASIC \n and won the contest The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game after that the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move Depending on the situation a slightly better strategy can be \"tit for tat with forgiveness\" When the opponent defects on the next move the player sometimes cooperates anyway with a small probability around 15% This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents \n By analysing the top-scoring strategies Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful \n Nice \n The most important condition is that the strategy must be \"nice\" that is it will not defect before its opponent does this is sometimes referred to as an \"optimistic\" algorithm Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice therefore a purely selfish strategy will not \"cheat\" on its opponent for purely self-interested reasons first \n Retaliating \n However Axelrod contended the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist It must sometimes retaliate An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate This is a very bad choice as \"nasty\" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players \n Forgiving \n Successful strategies must also be forgiving Though players will retaliate they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge maximizing points \n Non-envious \n The last quality is being non-envious that is not striving to score more than the opponent \n The optimal points-maximizing strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection as explained above this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be However in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents and how they will react to defections and cooperations For example consider a population where everyone defects every time except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn In such a population the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage and on the length of the game \n In the strategy called Pavlov \n win-stay lose-switch \n faced with a failure to cooperate the player switches strategy the next turn \n citation needed \n In certain circumstances \n specify \n Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy \n Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways \n Bayesian Nash Equilibrium \n If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined e g 50% tit for tat 50% always cooperate an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically \n Monte Carlo \n simulations of populations have been made where individuals with low scores die off and those with high scores reproduce a \n genetic algorithm \n for finding an optimal strategy The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population The introduction of mutation random variation during reproduction lessens the dependency on the initial population empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players see for instance Chess \n clarification needed \n but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur \n Although tit for tat is considered to be the most \n robust \n basic strategy a team from \n Southampton University \n in England led by \n Professor Nicholas Jennings \n and consisting of Rajdeep Dash Sarvapali Ramchurn Alex Rogers Perukrishnen Vytelingum introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition which proved to be more successful than tit for tat This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program The university submitted programs to the competition which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start \n Once this recognition was made one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect assuring the maximum number of points for the defector If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program As a result \n this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition as well as a number of positions towards the bottom \n This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of \n minmaxing \n In a competition where one has control of only a single player tit for tat is certainly a better strategy Because of this new rule this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament However it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks especially in the presence of noise In fact long before this new-rules tournament was played \n Richard Dawkins \n in his book \n The Selfish Gene \n pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening \"ten move dance\" to recognize one another this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game \n Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma \n In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game strategies are specified by in terms of \"cooperation probabilities\" \n In an encounter between player \n X \n and player \n Y \n X \n 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities \n P \n of cooperating with \n Y \n P \n is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof If \n P \n is a function of only their most recent \n n \n encounters it is called a \"memory-n\" strategy A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities \n P \n = \n { \n P \n c \n c \n P \n c \n d \n P \n d \n c \n P \n d \n d \n } \n { displaystyle P= {P {cc} P {cd} P {dc} P {dd} }} \n where \n P \n a \n b \n { displaystyle P {ab}} \n is the probability that \n X \n will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by ab For example if the previous encounter was one in which \n X \n cooperated and \n Y \n defected then \n P \n c \n d \n { displaystyle P {cd}} \n is the probability that \n X \n will cooperate in the present encounter If each of the probabilities are either or the strategy is called deterministic An example of a deterministic strategy is the \" \n tit for tat \n \" strategy written as \n P \n ={1 0} in which \n X \n responds as \n Y \n did in the previous encounter Another is the \n winstay loseswitch \n strategy written as \n P \n ={1 1} in which \n X \n responds as in the previous encounter if it was a \"win\" i e cc or dc but changes strategy if it was a loss i e cd or dd It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered \n If we define \n P \n as the above 4-element strategy vector of \n X \n and \n Q \n = \n { \n Q \n c \n c \n Q \n c \n d \n Q \n d \n c \n Q \n d \n d \n } \n { displaystyle Q= {Q {cc} Q {cd} Q {dc} Q {dd} }} \n as the 4-element strategy vector of \n Y \n a transition matrix \n M \n may be defined for \n X \n whose \n ij \n th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between \n X \n and \n Y \n will be \n j \n given that the previous encounter was \n i \n where \n i \n and \n j \n are one of the four outcome indices \n cc \n cd \n dc \n or \n dd \n For example from \n X \n 's point of view the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is \n cd \n given that the previous encounter was \n cd \n is equal to \n M \n c \n d \n c \n d \n = \n P \n c \n d \n Q \n d \n c \n { displaystyle M {cd cd}=P {cd} 1-Q {dc} } \n Note that the indices for \n Q \n are from \n Y \n 's point of view a \n cd \n outcome for \n X \n is a \n dc \n outcome for \n Y \n Under these definitions the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a \n stochastic process \n and \n M \n is a \n stochastic matrix \n allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied \n One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector \n v \n for the matrix \n M \n such that \n v \n M \n = \n v \n { displaystyle v cdot M=v} \n Without loss of generality it may be specified that \n v \n is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity The \n ij \n th entry in \n M \n n \n { displaystyle M^{n}} \n will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between \n X \n and \n Y \n will be \n j \n given that the encounter \n n \n steps previous is \n i \n In the limit as \n n \n approaches infinity \n M \n will converge to a matrix with fixed values giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing \n j \n which will be independent of \n i \n In other words the rows of \n M \n { displaystyle M^{ infty }} \n will be identical giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions It can be seen that \n v \n is a stationary vector for \n M \n n \n { displaystyle M^{n}} \n and particularly \n M \n { displaystyle M^{ infty }} \n so that each row of \n M \n { displaystyle M^{ infty }} \n will be equal to \n v \n Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for \n X \n Defining \n S \n x \n = \n { \n R \n S \n T \n P \n } \n { displaystyle S {x}= {R S T P }} \n and \n S \n y \n = \n { \n R \n T \n S \n P \n } \n { displaystyle S {y}= {R T S P }} \n as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc cd dc dd} outcomes From \n X \n 's point of view the equilibrium payoffs for \n X \n and \n Y \n can now be specified as \n s \n x \n = \n v \n S \n x \n { displaystyle s {x}=v cdot S {x}} \n and \n s \n y \n = \n v \n S \n y \n { displaystyle s {y}=v cdot S {y}} \n allowing the two strategies \n P \n and \n Q \n to be compared for their long term payoffs \n Zero-determinant strategies \n The relationship between zero-determinant ZD cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma IPD Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies under both strong and weak selection The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating defecting and ZD strategies \n In \n William H Press \n and \n Freeman Dyson \n published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called \"zero-determinant\" ZD strategies \n The long term payoffs for encounters between \n X \n and \n Y \n can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors \n s \n x \n = \n D \n P \n Q \n S \n x \n { displaystyle s {x}=D P Q S {x} } \n and \n s \n y \n = \n D \n P \n Q \n S \n y \n { displaystyle s {y}=D P Q S {y} } \n which do not involve the stationary vector \n v \n Since the determinant function \n s \n y \n = \n D \n P \n Q \n f \n { displaystyle s {y}=D P Q f } \n is linear in \n f \n it follows that \n s \n x \n + \n s \n y \n + \n = \n D \n P \n Q \n S \n x \n + \n S \n y \n + \n U \n { displaystyle alpha s {x}+ beta s {y}+ gamma =D P Q alpha S {x}+ beta S {y}+ gamma U } \n where \n U \n ={1 1} Any strategies for which \n D \n P \n Q \n S \n x \n + \n S \n y \n + \n U \n = \n { displaystyle D P Q alpha S {x}+ beta S {y}+ gamma U =0} \n is by definition a ZD strategy and the long term payoffs obey the relation \n s \n x \n + \n s \n y \n + \n = \n { displaystyle alpha s {x}+ beta s {y}+ gamma =0} \n Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is \"fair\" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player However the ZD space also contains strategies that in the case of two players can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff Thus extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of \n ultimatum game \n Specifically \n X \n is able to choose a strategy for which \n D \n P \n Q \n S \n y \n + \n U \n = \n { displaystyle D P Q beta S {y}+ gamma U =0} \n unilaterally setting \n s \n y \n { displaystyle s {y}} \n to a specific value within a particular range of values independent of \n Y \n 's strategy offering an opportunity for \n X \n to \"extort\" player \n Y \n and vice versa It turns out that if \n X \n tries to set \n s \n x \n { displaystyle s {x}} \n to a particular value the range of possibilities is much smaller only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection \n An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change with more successful strategies relatively increasing This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies or by eliminating less successful players from the game while multiplying the more successful ones It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not \n evolutionarily stable \n The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population which extortionary ZD strategies can do but must also perform well against other players of the same type which extortionary ZD players do poorly because they reduce each other's surplus \n Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies and as a result the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger In addition there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and \n winstay loseswitch \n agents \n While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations another ZD class called \"generous\" strategies \n is \n both stable and robust In fact when the population is not too small these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma including winstay loseswitch This was proven specifically for the \n donation game \n by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in \n Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players and in the face of defection the generous player loses more utility than its rival Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called \"good\" strategies which were defined by Akin \n to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff Among good strategies the generous ZD subset performs well when the population is not too small If the population is very small defection strategies tend to dominate \n Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma \n Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case in which players either cooperate or defect because this model is relatively simple to analyze However some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player Le and Boyd \n found that in such situations cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma The basic intuition for this result is straightforward in a continuous prisoner's dilemma if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from \n assorting \n with one another By contrast in a discrete prisoner's dilemma tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium relative to non-cooperators Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature ex Hammerstein \n even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models \n Emergence of stable strategies \n Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection In this way iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies \n Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies which have implications to complex social interaction One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy that is if you can get away with cheating repeat that behavior however if you get caught switch \n The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating As a result of this the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction \n Real-life examples \n The prisoner setting may seem contrived but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the \n social sciences \n such as \n economics \n politics \n and \n sociology \n as well as to the biological sciences such as \n ethology \n and \n evolutionary biology \n Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance \n In environmental studies \n In \n environmental studies \n the PD is evident in crises such as global \n climate-change \n It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate but any single country is often hesitant to curb \n CO \n emissions The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in \n An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma \n Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the lines of \n Michael Porter \n 's hypothesis in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial \n In animals \n Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma Often animals engage in long term partnerships which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma For example \n guppies \n inspect predators cooperatively in groups and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors \n Vampire bats are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior \n C/C \"Reward I get blood on my unlucky nights which saves me from starving I have to give blood on my lucky nights which doesn't cost me too much \" \n D/C \"Temptation You save my life on my poor night But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night \" \n C/D \"Sucker's Payoff I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death \" \n D/D \"Punishment I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights \" \n In psychology \n In \n addiction \n research / \n behavioral economics \n George Ainslie \n points out \n that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict In this case \n defecting \n means \n relapsing \n and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been \"wasted\" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over which is quite demoralizing and makes starting over more difficult Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly \"better\" outcome because while the addict is still addicted they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop The final case where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining \"tomorrow\" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction The problem here is that as in other PDs there is an obvious benefit to defecting \"today\" but tomorrow one will face the same PD and the same obvious benefit will be present then ultimately leading to an endless string of defections \n John Gottman \n in his research described in \"the science of trust\" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the D D cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop \n In economics \n Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoners dilemma When \n cigarette advertising \n was legal in the United States competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising The effectiveness of Firm As advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B Likewise the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period then the advertising cancels out receipts remain constant and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising However should Firm B choose not to advertise Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising Nevertheless the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma The outcome is similar though in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations For instance cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry \n citation needed \n This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising \n citation needed \n Without enforceable agreements members of a \n cartel \n are also involved in a multi-player prisoner's dilemma \n 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level instantly taking business and profits from other cartel members \n Anti-trust \n authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect ensuring the lowest possible prices for \n consumers \n In sport \n Doping in sport \n has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma \n Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance If neither athlete takes the drug then neither gains an advantage If only one does then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug If both athletes take the drug however the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping \n Multiplayer dilemmas \n Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players \n Although metaphorical \n Hardin's \n tragedy of the commons \n may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint The collective reward for unanimous or even frequent defection is very low payoffs representing the destruction of the \"commons\" A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone \n The commons are not always exploited \n William Poundstone \n in a book about the prisoner's dilemma see References below describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked It is possible for people to \n take a paper without paying \n defecting \n but very few do feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others destroying the system Subsequent research by \n Elinor Ostrom \n winner of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel hypothesized that the \n tragedy of the commons \n is oversimplified with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences Without complicating pressures groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD \n In international politics \n In \n international political theory \n the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of \n strategic realism \n which holds that in international relations all states regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology will act in their rational self-interest given \n international anarchy \n A classic example is an arms race like the \n Cold War \n and similar conflicts \n During the Cold War the opposing alliances of \n NATO \n and the \n Warsaw Pact \n both had the choice to arm or disarm From each side's point of view disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation Conversely arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority If both sides chose to arm neither could afford to attack the other but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal If both sides chose to disarm war would be avoided and there would be no costs \n Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm the rational course for both sides is to arm and this is indeed what happened Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a \n war of attrition \n for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost \n citation needed \n The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states \n Related games \n Closed-bag exchange \n The prisoner's dilemma as a briefcase exchange \n Douglas Hofstadter \n once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game or trade-off One of several examples he used was \"closed bag exchange\" \n Two people meet and exchange closed bags with the understanding that one of them contains money and the other contains a purchase Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag \n In this game defection is always the best course implying that rational agents will never play However in this case both players cooperating and both players defecting actually give the same result assuming no \n gains from trade \n exist so chances of mutual cooperation even in repeated games are few \n dubious \n discuss \n Friend or Foe? \n Friend or Foe? \n is a game show that aired from to on the \n Game Show Network \n in the \n USA \n It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people but in an artificial setting On the game show three pairs of people compete When a pair is eliminated they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split If they both cooperate Friend they share the winnings If one cooperates and the other defects Foe the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing If both defect both leave with nothing Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above as the rewards for the \"both defect\" and the \"cooperate while the opponent defects\" cases are identical This makes the \"both defect\" case a weak equilibrium compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote \"Foe\" then their own choice does not affect their own winnings In a specific sense \n Friend or Foe \n has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the \n game of Chicken \n The rewards matrix is \n Pair \n Pair \n \"Friend\" \n cooperate \n \"Foe\" \n

University of Lausanne \n and the \n University of Edinburgh \n have suggested that the \"Iterated Snowdrift Game\" may more closely reflect real-world social situations Although this model is actually a \n chicken game \n it will be described here In this model the risk of being exploited through defection is lower and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a \n snowdrift \n each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path or remaining in their car A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work \n This may better reflect real world scenarios the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder \"But when your collaborator doesnt do any work its probably better for you to do

bee can be explained by kin selection \n Kin selection \n is the \n evolutionary \n strategy that favours the reproductive success of an organism's relatives even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction \n Kin altruism \n is \n altruistic behaviour \n whose evolution is driven by kin selection Kin selection is an instance of \n inclusive fitness \n which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others such as siblings \n Charles Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his book \n The Origin of Species \n where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects such as \n honey bees \n which leave reproduction to their mothers arguing that a selection benefit to related organisms the same \"stock\" would allow the evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the same time \n R A Fisher \n in and \n J B S Haldane \n in set out the mathematics of kin selection with Haldane famously joking that he would willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins In \n W D Hamilton \n popularised the concept and the major advance in the mathematical treatment of the phenomenon by \n George R Price \n which has become known as \n Hamilton's rule \n In the same year \n John Maynard Smith \n used the actual term kin selection for the first time \n According to Hamilton's rule kin selection causes genes to increase in frequency when the genetic relatedness of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient is greater than the reproductive cost to the actor The rule is difficult to test but studies of \n red squirrels \n appear to confirm it Hamilton proposed two mechanisms for kin selection First \n kin recognition \n allows individuals to be able to identify their relatives Second in viscous populations populations in which the movement of organisms from their place of birth is relatively slow local interactions tend to be among relatives by default The viscous population mechanism makes kin selection and social cooperation possible in the absence of kin recognition In this case \n nurture kinship \n the treatment of individuals as kin as a result of living together is sufficient for kin selection given reasonable assumptions about population dispersal rates Note that kin selection is not the same thing as \n group selection \n where \n natural selection \n acts on the group as a whole \n In humans altruism is both more likely and on a larger scale with kin than with unrelated individuals for example humans give presents according to how closely related they are to the recipient In other species \n vervet monkeys \n use \n allomothering \n where related females such as older sisters or grandmothers often care for young according to their relatedness The social shrimp \n Synalpheus regalis \n protects juveniles within highly related colonies \n Historical overview \n Hamilton's rule \n Mechanisms \n Kin selection and human social patterns \n Examples \n In humans \n Experimental studies interviews and surveys \n Observational studies \n In non-human species \n Objections \n Historical overview \n Charles Darwin \n was the first to discuss the concept of kin selection In \n The Origin of Species \n he wrote clearly about the conundrum represented by \n altruistic \n sterile \n social insects \n that \n This difficulty though appearing insuperable is lessened or as I believe disappears when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family as well as to the individual and may thus gain the desired end Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together An animal thus characterised has been slaughtered but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has succeeded \n Darwin \n In this passage \"the family\" and \"stock\" stand for a kin group These passages and others by Darwin about \"kin selection\" are highlighted in \n D J Futuyma's \n textbook of reference \n Evolutionary Biology \n and in \n E O Wilson \n 's \n Sociobiology \n The earliest mathematically formal treatments of kin selection were by \n R A Fisher \n in \n and \n J B S Haldane \n in \n and \n J B S Haldane fully grasped the basic quantities and considerations in kin selection famously writing \"I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight \n cousins \n \" \n Haldane's remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life to save two siblings four nephews or eight cousins it is a \"fair deal\" in evolutionary terms as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent nephews 25% and cousins 5% in a \n diploid \n population that is randomly mating and previously \n outbred \n But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to save more than a single identical twin of his or more than two full siblings \n In he clarified \n Let us suppose that you carry a rare gene that affects your behaviour so that you jump into a flooded river and save a child but you have one chance in ten of being drowned while I do not possess the gene and stand on the bank and watch the child drown If the child's your own child or your brother or sister there is an even chance that this child will also have this gene so five genes will be saved in children for one lost in an adult If you save a grandchild or a nephew the advantage is only two and a half to one If you only save a first cousin the effect is very slight If you try to save your first cousin once removed the population is more likely to lose this valuable gene than to gain it It is clear that genes making for conduct of this kind would only have a chance of spreading in rather small populations when most of the children were fairly near relatives of the man who risked his life \n W D Hamilton \n in \n and especially in popularised the concept and the more thorough mathematical treatment given to it by \n George Price \n John Maynard Smith \n may have coined the actual term \"kin selection\" in \n These processes I will call kin selection and group selection respectively Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by Hamilton By kin selection I mean the evolution of characteristics which favour the survival of close relatives of the affected individual by processes which do not require any discontinuities in the population breeding structure \n Kin selection causes changes in \n gene \n frequency across generations driven by interactions between related individuals This dynamic forms the conceptual basis of the theory of \n social evolution \n Some cases of \n evolution \n by \n natural selection \n can only be understood by considering how biological relatives influence each other's \n fitness \n Under natural selection a gene encoding a \n trait \n that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase in frequency within the \n population \n and conversely a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated However a hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behaviour may nonetheless increase in frequency because relatives often carry the same gene According to this principle the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour making kin selection possible This is a special case of a more general model \" \n inclusive fitness \n \" \n This analysis has been challenged \n Wilson writing that \"the foundations of the general theory of inclusive fitness based on the theory of kin selection have crumbled\" \n and that he now relies instead on the theory of \n eusociality \n and \"gene-culture co-evolution\" for the underlying mechanics of \n sociobiology \n \"Kin selection\" should not be confused with \" \n group selection \n \" according to which a genetic trait can become prevalent within a group because it benefits the group as a whole regardless of any benefit to individual organisms All known forms of group selection conform to the principle that an individual behaviour can be evolutionarily successful only if the genes responsible for this behaviour conform to Hamilton's Rule and hence on balance and in the aggregate benefit from the behaviour \n Hamilton's rule \n Further information \n Biological rules \n Formally genes should increase in frequency when \n r \n B \n > \n C \n { displaystyle rB>C} \n where \n r \n =the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor often defined as the probability that a gene picked randomly from each at the same \n locus \n is identical by descent \n B \n =the additional reproductive benefit gained by the recipient of the \n altruistic \n act \n C \n =the reproductive cost to the individual performing the act \n This inequality is known as \n Hamilton's rule \n after W D Hamilton who in published the first formal quantitative treatment of kin selection \n The \n relatedness \n parameter r in Hamilton's rule was introduced in by \n Sewall Wright \n as a \n coefficient of relationship \n that gives the \n probability \n that at a random \n locus \n the \n alleles \n there will be \n identical by descent \n Subsequent authors including Hamilton sometimes reformulate this with a \n regression \n which unlike probabilities can be negative A regression analysis producing statistically significant negative relationships indicates that two individuals are less genetically alike than two random ones Hamilton Nature & Grafen Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology This has been invoked to explain the evolution of \n spiteful \n behaviour consisting of acts that result in harm or loss of fitness to both the actor and the recipient \n Several scientific studies have found that the kin selection model can be applied to nature For example in researchers used a wild population of \n red squirrels \n in Yukon Canada to study kin selection in nature The researchers found that surrogate mothers would adopt related orphaned squirrel pups but not unrelated orphans The researchers calculated the cost of adoption by measuring a decrease in the survival probability of the entire litter after increasing the litter by one pup while benefit was measured as the increased chance of survival of the orphan The degree of relatedness of the orphan and surrogate mother for adoption to occur depended on the number of pups the surrogate mother already had in her nest as this affected the cost of adoption The study showed that females always adopted orphans when rB > C but never adopted when rB < C providing strong support for Hamilton's rule \n Mechanisms \n Altruism \n occurs where the instigating individual suffers a fitness loss while the receiving individual experiences a fitness gain The sacrifice of one individual to help another is an example \n Hamilton outlined two ways in which kin selection altruism could be favoured \n The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious It may be for instance that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to \n inclusive fitness \n would at once appear Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected In fact the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to or far from his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind \" \n Kin recognition \n theory predicts that bearers of a trait like the fictitious \n 'green beard' \n will behave altruistically towards others with the same trait \n Kin recognition \n First if individuals have the \n capacity to recognise kin \n and to discriminate positively on the basis of \n kinship \n then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough for kin selection Because of the facultative nature of this mechanism kin recognition and discrimination are expected to be unimportant except among 'higher' forms of life such as the fish \n Neolamprologus pulcher \n although there is some evidence for it among \n protozoa \n Note also that kin recognition may be selected for inbreeding avoidance and little evidence indicates that 'innate' kin recognition plays a role in mediating altruism A thought experiment on the kin recognition/discrimination distinction is the hypothetical \n 'green beard' \n where a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome there would be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed making common ancestry the most likely form of inclusive fitness \n Viscous populations \n Secondly even indiscriminate altruism may be favoured in \"viscous\" populations with low rates or short ranges of dispersal Here social partners are typically genealogically close kin and so altruism can flourish even in the absence of kin recognition and kin discrimination facultiesspatial proximity and circumstantial cues serving as a rudimentary form of discrimination This suggests a rather general explanation for altruism Directional selection always favours those with higher rates of fecundity within a certain population Social individuals can often enhance the survival of their own kin by participating in and following the rules of their own group \n Hamilton later modified his thinking to suggest that an innate ability to recognise actual genetic relatedness was unlikely to be the dominant mediating mechanism for kin altruism \n But once again we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation used for social behaviour other than mating for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees Hamilton \n Hamilton's later clarifications often go unnoticed and because of the long-standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin recognition some theorists have tried to clarify the position in recent work \n In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways kin discrimination or limited dispersal Hamilton There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt & Bever and West et al 2002a as well as experimental evolution tests of these models Diggle et al Griffin et al Kmmerli et al However despite this it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination Oates & Wilson Silk Furthermore a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives T here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination misconception despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory Hamilton Hamilton Hamilton Hamilton West et al p and supplement \n The assumption that kin recognition must be innate and that cue-based mediation of social cooperation based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context are not sufficient has obscured significant progress made in applying kin selection and inclusive fitness theory to a wide variety of species including humans \n on the basis of cue-based mediation of \n social bonding and social behaviours \n Kin selection and human social patterns \n Families \n are important in human behaviour but kin selection may be based on closeness and other cues \n Human inclusive fitness \n and \n Nurture kinship \n Evolutionary psychologists \n following \n early human sociobiologists' \n interpretation \n of kin selection theory initially attempted to explain human altruistic behaviour through kin selection by stating that \"behaviors that help a genetic relative are favored by natural selection \" However most Evolutionary psychologists recognise that this common shorthand formulation is inaccurate \n M any misunderstandings persist In many cases they result from conflating \"coefficient of relatedness\" and \"proportion of shared genes \" which is a short step from the intuitively appealingbut incorrectinterpretation that \"animals tend to be altruistic toward those with whom they share a lot of genes \" These misunderstandings dont just crop up occasionally they are repeated in many writings including undergraduate psychology textbooksmost of them in the field of social psychology within sections describing evolutionary approaches to altruism Park p860 \n As with the earlier sociobiological forays into the cross-cultural data typical approaches are not able to find explanatory fit with the findings of ethnographers insofar that human kinship patterns are not necessarily built upon blood-ties However as Hamilton's later refinements of his theory make clear it does not simply predict that genetically related individuals will inevitably recognise and engage in positive social behaviours with genetic relatives rather indirect context-based mechanisms may have evolved which in historical environments have met the inclusive fitness criterion see above section Consideration of the demographics of the typical evolutionary environment of any species is crucial to understanding the evolution of social behaviours As Hamilton himself puts it \"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start \" Hamilton \n Under this perspective and noting the necessity of a reliable context of interaction being available the data on how altruism is mediated in social mammals is readily made sense of In social mammals primates and humans altruistic acts that meet the kin selection criterion are typically mediated by circumstantial cues such as shared developmental environment familiarity and social bonding \n That is it is the context that mediates the development of the bonding process and the expression of the altruistic behaviours not genetic relatedness \n per se \n This interpretation thus is compatible with the cross-cultural ethnographic data \n and has been called \n nurture kinship \n Examples \n Eusociality \n true sociality is used to describe social systems with three characteristics an overlap in generations between parents and their offspring cooperative brood care and specialised castes of non-reproductive individuals \n The social insects provide good examples of organisms with what appear to be kin selected traits The workers of some species are sterile a trait that would not occur if individual selection was the only process at work The relatedness coefficient \n r \n is abnormally high between the worker sisters in a colony of \n Hymenoptera \n due to \n haplodiploidy \n Hamilton's rule is presumed to be satisfied because the benefits in \n fitness \n for the workers are believed to exceed the costs in terms of lost reproductive opportunity though this has never been demonstrated empirically There are competing hypotheses as well which may also explain the evolution of social behaviour in such organisms \n Sun-tailed monkeys \n favour their own maternal kin \n In \n sun-tailed monkey \n communities maternal kin kin related to by mothers favour each other but that with relatives more distant than half-siblings this bias drops significantly \n Alarm calls in ground squirrels appear to confirm kin selection While calls may alert others of the same species to danger they draw attention to the caller and expose it to increased risk of predation The calls occur most frequently when the caller had relatives nearby \n Individual male prairie dogs followed through different stages of life modify their rate of calling when closer to kin These behaviours show that self-sacrifice is directed towards close relatives and that there is an indirect fitness gain \n Surrogate mothers adopt orphaned red squirrels in the wild only when the conditions of Hamilton's rule were met \n Alan Krakauer of \n University of California Berkeley \n has studied kin selection in the courtship behaviour of wild turkeys Like a teenager helping her older sister prepare for a party a subordinate turkey may help his dominant brother put on an impressive team display that is only of direct benefit to the dominant member \n Even certain plants can recognise and respond to kinship ties Using \n sea rocket \n Susan Dudley at \n McMaster University \n Canada \n compared the growth patterns of unrelated plants sharing a pot to plants from the same clone She found that unrelated plants competed for soil nutrients by aggressive root growth This did not occur with sibling plants \n In the \n wood mouse \n Apodemus sylvaticus \n aggregates of spermatozoa form mobile trains some of the spermatozoa undergo premature acrosome reactions that correlate to improved mobility of the mobile trains towards the female egg for fertilisation This association is thought to proceed as a result of a \"green beard effect\" in which the spermatozoa perform a kin-selective altruistic act after identifying genetic similarity with the surrounding spermatozoa \n In humans \n Human inclusive fitness \n Whether or not \n Hamilton's rule \n always applies relatedness is often important for human altruism in that humans are inclined to behave more altruistically toward kin than toward unrelated individuals \n Many people choose to live near relatives exchange sizeable gifts with relatives and favour relatives in wills in proportion to their relatedness \n Experimental studies interviews and surveys \n Interviews of several hundred women in Los Angeles showed that while non-kin friends were willing to help one another their assistance was far more likely to be reciprocal The largest amounts of non-reciprocal help however were reportedly provided by kin Additionally more closely related kin were considered more likely sources of assistance than distant kin \n Similarly several surveys of American college students found that individuals were more likely to incur the cost of assisting kin when a high probability that relatedness and benefit would be greater than cost existed Participants feelings of helpfulness were stronger toward family members than non-kin Additionally participants were found to be most willing to help those individuals most closely related to them Interpersonal relationships between kin in general were more supportive and less Machiavellian than those between non-kin \n In one experiment the longer participants from both the UK and the South African Zulus held a painful skiing position the more money or food was presented to a given relative Participants repeated the experiment for individuals of different relatedness parents and siblings at r= grandparents nieces and nephews at r= etc The results showed that participants held the position for longer intervals the greater the degree of relatedness between themselves and those receiving the reward \n Observational studies \n A study of food-sharing practices on the West Caroline islets of Ifaluk determined that food-sharing was more common among people from the same islet possibly because the degree of relatedness between inhabitants of the same islet would be higher than relatedness between inhabitants of different islets When food was shared between islets the distance the sharer was required to travel correlated with the relatedness of the recipienta greater distance meant that the recipient needed to be a closer relative The relatedness of the individual and the potential inclusive fitness benefit needed to outweigh the energy cost of transporting the food over distance \n Humans may use the inheritance of material goods and wealth to maximise their inclusive fitness By providing close kin with inherited wealth an individual may improve his or her kins reproductive opportunities and thus increase his or her own inclusive fitness even after death A study of a thousand wills found that the beneficiaries who received the most inheritance were generally those most closely related to the wills writer Distant kin received proportionally less inheritance with the least amount of inheritance going to non-kin \n A study of childcare practices among Canadian women found that respondents with children provide childcare reciprocally with non-kin The cost of caring for non-kin was balanced by the benefit a woman receivedhaving her own offspring cared for in return However respondents without children were significantly more likely to offer childcare to kin For individuals without their own offspring the inclusive fitness benefits of providing care to closely related children might outweigh the time and energy costs of childcare \n Family investment in offspring among black South African households also appears consistent with an inclusive fitness model \n A higher degree of relatedness between children and their caregivers frequently correlated with a higher degree of investment in the children with more food health care and clothing being provided Relatedness between the child and the rest of the household also positively associated with the regularity of a childs visits to local medical practitioners and with the highest grade the child had completed in school Additionally relatedness negatively associated with a childs being behind in school for his or her age \n Observation of the Dolgan hunter-gatherers of northern Russia suggested that while reciprocal food-sharing occurs between both kin and non-kin there are larger and more frequent asymmetrical transfers of food to kin Kin are also more likely to be welcomed to non-reciprocal meals while non-kin are discouraged from attending Finally even when reciprocal food-sharing occurs between families these families are often very closely related and the primary beneficiaries are the offspring \n Other research indicates that violence in families is more likely to occur when step-parents are present and that \"genetic relationship is associated with a softening of conflict and people's evident valuations of themselves and of others are systematically related to the parties' reproductive values\" \n Numerous other studies suggest how inclusive fitness may work amongst different peoples such as the Yekwana of southern Venezuela the Gypsies of Hungary and the doomed Donner Party of the United States \n In non-human species \n Vervet monkeys

developmental system of many \"individuals\" performing different tasks like a colony of bees or the cells of multicellular organisms which are the focus of selection They also argue that the genes

rules and conforming to socially accepted behaviors such as stopping at a \"Stop\" sign or paying for groceries are also regarded as prosocial behaviors \n These actions may be motivated by \n empathy \n and by concern about the welfare and rights of others \n as well as for egoistic or practical concerns such as one's social status or reputation hope for direct or indirect \n reciprocity \n or adherence to one's perceived system of fairness \n It may also be motivated by \n altruism \n though the existence of pure altruism is somewhat disputed and some have argued that this falls into philosophical rather than psychological realm of debate \n Evidence suggests that pro sociality is central to the well-being of social groups across a range of scales including schools Prosocial behavior in \n the classroom \n can have a significant impact on a students motivation for learning and contributions to the classroom and larger community \n Empathy is a strong motive in eliciting prosocial behavior and has deep evolutionary roots \n Prosocial behavior fosters positive traits that are beneficial for children and society Evolutionary psychologists use theories such as kin-selection theory and inclusive fitness as an explanation for why prosocial behavioral tendencies are passed down generationally according to the evolutionary fitness displayed by those who engaged in prosocial acts \n Encouraging prosocial behavior may also require decreasing or eliminating undesirable social behaviors \n Although the term \"prosocial behavior\" is often associated with developing desirable traits in children \n the literature on the topic has grown since the late 1980s to include adult behaviors as well \n Origin of the term \n Reciprocity vs altruism in motivation

programming and video games on children \n Legislation \n Influence of observation \n Influence of perception of responsibility and guilt \n Social media in natural disasters \n Relation to mood and emotion \n Psychopathy and lack of prosocial behavior \n Helper's high \n Prosocial dissidence \n Labor market outcomes \n Further reading \n Origin of the term \n According to the psychology researcher C Daniel Batson the term \"was created by social scientists as an antonym for antisocial \" \n Reciprocity vs altruism in motivation \n The purest forms of prosocial behavior are motivated by \n altruism \n an unselfish interest in helping another person According to Santrock \n the circumstances most likely to evoke altruism are empathy for an individual in need or a close relationship between the benefactor and the recipient However many prosocial behaviors that appear altruistic are in fact motivated by the norm of reciprocity which is the obligation to return a favor with a favor People feel \n guilty \n when they do not reciprocate and they may feel angry when someone else does not reciprocate Reciprocal altruism suggests that \"such helping is driven by a genetic tendency\" \n Thus some professionals argue that altruism may not exist and is completely motivated by reciprocity \n Either reciprocity or altruism may motivate many important prosocial behaviors including sharing \n Situational and individual factors \n Prosocial behavior is mediated by both situational and individual factors \n Situational factors \n One of the most common situation factors is the occurrence of the \n bystander effect \n The bystander effect is the phenomenon that an individuals likelihood of helping decreases when passive bystanders are present in a critical situation For example when someone drops a stack of papers on a crowded sidewalk most people are likely to continue passing him/her by This example can be extended to even more urgent situations such as a car crash or natural disaster \n The decision model of bystander intervention noted that whether or not an individual gives aid in a situation depends upon their analysis of the situation An individual will consider whether or not the situation requires their assistance if the assistance is the responsibility of the individual and how to help \n This model proposed by \n describes five things that must occur in order for a person to intervene \n Notice the situation \n Construe it as an emergency \n Develop feelings of responsibility \n Believe they have skills to succeed \n Reach a conscious decision to help \n The number of individuals present in the situation requiring help is also a mediating factor in ones decision to give aid where the more individuals are present the less likely it is for one particular individual to give aid due to a reduction in perceived personal responsibility \n This is known as diffusion of responsibility where the responsibility one feels for the person s in need is divided by the number of bystanders Another factor that comes into play is evaluation apprehension which simply refers to the fear of being judged by other bystanders Finally pluralistic ignorance may also lead to someone not intervening This refers to relying on the reaction of others before reacting yourself \n Additionally Piliavin et al noted that individuals are likely to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs when determining whether or not to give aid in a situation that is that people are rationally self-motivated Prosocial behavior is more likely to occur if the cost of helping is low i e minimal time or minimal effort if helping would actually benefit the individual providing the help in some way and if the rewards of providing the help are large If it is in an individuals interest to help they will most likely do so especially if the cost of not providing the help is great \n People are also more likely to help those in their social group or their \"in group\" With a sense of shared identity with the individual requiring assistance the altruist is more likely to provide help on the basis that one allocates more time and energy towards helping behavior within individuals of their own group The labeling of another individual as a member of ones \"in-group\" leads to greater feelings of closeness emotional arousal and a heightened sense of personal responsibility for the others welfare all of which increase the motivation to act prosocially \n Researchers have also found that social exclusion decreases the likelihood of prosocial behavior occurring In a series of seven experiments conducted by Twenge et al researchers manipulated social inclusion or exclusion by telling research participants that other participants had purposefully excluded them or that they would probably end up alone later in life They found that this preliminary social exclusion caused prosocial behavior to drop significantly noting that \"Socially excluded people donated less money to a student fund were unwilling to volunteer for further lab experiments were less helpful after a mishap and cooperated less in a mixed-motive game with another student \" \n This effect is thought to be due to the fact that prosocial behavior again is motivated by a sense of responsibility in caring for and sharing resources with members of one's own group \n Individual factors \n Individuals can be compelled to act prosocially based on learning and socialization during childhood Operant conditioning and social learning positively reinforces discrete instances of prosocial behaviors Helping skills and a habitual motivation to help others is therefore socialized and reinforced as children understand why helping skills should be used to help others around them \n Social and individual standards and ideals also motivate individuals to engage in prosocial behavior Social responsibility norms and social reciprocity norms reinforce those who act prosocially As an example consider the child who is positively reinforced for \"sharing\" during their early childhood years \n When acting prosocially individuals reinforce and maintain their positive self-images or personal ideals as well as help to fulfill their own personal needs \n Another important psychological determinant of pro-social behavior is someone's personal or moral norm For example in a study on charitable giving van der Linden found that in contrast to social norms moral norms were the single most important predictor of intentions to donate to charity \n The author argues that pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving are often driven by personal feelings of what the 'right thing' to do is in a given situation in this view pro-social behavior is believed to be determined by intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivations A possible explanation is that when pro-social behaviors such as donating take place in a private setting in the absence of any exogenous social pressure the behavior is more likely to be guided by internal moral considerations It should be noted however that social and moral norms are closely related because social groups deliver standards for what is viewed as right or wrong it is over time when social norms have been internalized that they become a personal moral norm - operating independently of any immediate social context \n Emotional arousal is an additional important motivator for prosocial behavior in general Batson's empathy-altruism model examines the emotional and motivational component of prosocial behavior Feeling empathy towards the individual needing aid increases the likelihood that the aid will be given This empathy is called \"empathetic concern\" for the other individual and is characterized by feelings of tenderness compassion and sympathy \n Agreeableness is thought to be the personality trait most associated with inherent prosocial motivation Prosocial thoughts and feelings may be defined as a sense of responsibility for other individuals and a higher likelihood of experiencing empathy \"other-oriented empathy\" both affectively emotionally and cognitively These prosocial thoughts and feelings correlate with dispositional empathy and dispositional agreeableness \n Other factors \n In addition to situational and individualistic factors there are some categorical characteristics that can impact prosocial behavior Several studies have indicated a positive relationship between prosocial behavior and religion \n In addition there may be sex differences in prosocial behavior particularly as youths move into adolescence \n Research suggests that while women and men both engage in prosocial behaviors women tend to engage in more communal and relational prosocial behaviors whereas men tend to engage in more agentic prosocial behaviors \n A recent study examining workplace charitable giving looked at the role of both sex and ethnicity Results showed that women gave significantly more than men and Caucasians gave significantly more than minority groups However the percent of minority individuals in the workplace was positively associated with workplace charitable giving by minorities \n Culture sex and religion are important factors to consider in understanding prosocial behavior on an individual and group level \n In childhood through early adolescence \n Prosocial behavior in childhood often begins with questions of sharing and fairness From age months children begin to display prosocial behavior in presenting and giving their toys to their parents without promoting or being reinforced by praise \n The development of prosocial behavior continues throughout the second year of life as children begin to gain a moral understanding of the world \n As obedience to societal standards becomes important childrens ability to exhibit prosocial behavior strengthens with occurrence and diversity of these behaviors increasing with age and cognitive maturity \n What is important developmentally is that the child has developed a belief that sharing is an obligatory part of a social relationship and involves a question of right and wrong \n So as children move through childhood their reasoning changes from being hedonistic and needs-oriented to becoming more concerned with approval and more involved in complex cognitive forms of perspective taking and reciprocity reasoning \n Additionally children's prosocial behavior is typically more centered around interest in friends and concern for approval whereas adolescents begin to develop reasoning that is more concerned with abstract principles such as guilt and positive affect \n Parents can set examples that children carry into their interactions and communication with peers but parents are not present during all of their children's peer exchanges The day-to-day constructions of fairness standards is done by children in collaboration and negotiation with each other \n Recent research demonstrates that invoking the self using subtle linguistic cues e g identifying someone as a \"helper\" versus labeling the action \"helping\" fosters the perception that a behavior reflects identity and increases helping or prosocial behaviors in children significantly across tasks \n Another study by Nantel-Vivier et al used a multi-informant model to investigate the development of prosocial behaviour in both Canadian and Italian adolescents aged \n Their findings have indicated that in early adolescence although empathy and moral reasoning continue to advance the development of prosocial behaviors reaches a plateau Theories for this change in development suggest that it is the result of more individualized and selective prosocial behaviors During adolescence youth begin to focus these behaviors toward their peer groups and/or affiliations \n Consistent with previous analyses this study also found a tendency toward higher prosocial behaviors in young adolescent girls compared to their male classmates The earlier maturation in females may be a possible explanation for this disparity A more recent study that focused on the effects of pubertal timing found that early maturation in adolescents has a positive impact on prosocial behaviors While their findings apply to both genders this study found a much more pronounced effect in males This suggests that earlier onset of puberty has a positive correlation with the development of prosocial behaviors \n In many \n Indigenous American communities \n prosocial behavior is a valued means of learning and child rearing Such behaviors are seen as contributing in an eagerly \n collaborative \n and flexible environment aimed at teaching consideration responsibility and skills with the guidance and support of adults \n Culturally valued developmental goals are integrally tied to \n children's participation \n in these contexts \n It is also helpful for children to learn cultural mores in addition to individual personality development Children learn functional life skills through real-time observation of adults and interactive participation of these learned skills within their community \n Prosocial development in school \n Prosocial behavior can act as a strong motivator in education for it provides students with a purpose beyond themselves and the classroom This purpose beyond the self or self-transcendence \n is an innate human need to be a part of something bigger than themselves When learning in isolation the way Western academics are traditionally designed students struggle to make connections to the material and its greater overarching purpose This disconnection harms student learning motivation and attitudes about education \n If teachers make space for prosocial behavior in education and \n social learning \n then they can illustrate that what students are learning will have a direct impact on the world that they live in This would be considered a mutually constituting relationship \n or a relationship in which both individuals and culture develop interdependently In other words what students are learning in a classroom could be intimately connected with a purpose towards a greater cause deepening the learning itself \n Studies by Yeager et al \n test the effects of having a self-transcendent purpose for learning with the results showing that such a purpose for learning led to fewer future college dropouts increased high school math and science GPAs and persistence on boring tasks This self transcendent purpose may not only encourage persistence on boring tasks but may help to make boring tasks more meaningful and engaging \n A person's ideas and opinions are largely shaped by the world that they grow up in which in turn determines what sort of change they want to instill in the world For example a girl who grew up in poverty becoming a social worker The environment she grew up in gave her an awareness of the workings of poverty motivating her to instill change in either the institutions that cause it or help those affected by poverty \n There aren't many opportunities to make prosocial contributions in school which makes school feel isolated and irrelevant By encouraging students to find a self-transcendent purpose in their learning we enable them to enjoy their learning and make connections to community contributions \n Influence of media programming and video games on children \n Studies have shown that different types of media programming may evoke prosocial behaviors in children \n The channels aimed at younger viewers like \n Nickelodeon \n and \n Disney Channel \n had significantly more acts of altruism than the general-audience demographic channels like \n A&E \n and or \n TNT \n according to one large-scale study This study examined the programming of different channels including more than entertainment shows during a randomly selected week on television The study revealed that nearly three quarters percent of programs contained at least one act of \n altruism \n and on average viewers saw around three acts of altruism an hour Around one-third of those behaviors were explicitly rewarded in the plot potentially sending the message that these acts of prosocial behavior can come with positive consequences \n Another study on the topic was conducted by \n University at Buffalo \n Iowa State University \n and \n University of Minnesota \n professors They studied children for two years for the purpose of investigating the role of media exposure on prosocial behavior for young boys and girls The study concluded that media exposure could possibly predict outcomes related to prosocial behavior \n Other experimental research has suggested that prosocial video games may increase prosocial behavior in players \n although some of this work has proven difficult to replicate \n However other scholars have been critical of this work for tending to falsely dichotomize video games into prosocial/violent categories despite significant overlap as well as methodological flaws in the experimental studies \n For instance a study by Ferguson and Garza found that exposure to violent video games was associated with increased prosocial behavior both on-line as well as volunteering in the real world The authors speculated this may be due to the prosocial themes common in many violent games as well as team oriented play in many games \n Legislation \n In the United States in an effort to get stations to air education and prosocial programming for children the \n Children's Television Act \n was adopted in It states that channels must produce and air programming developed specifically for children as a condition to renew broadcast licenses After discussions as to what the definition of \"specifically designed for children\" really means in guidelines were passed to correct this ambiguity \n Influence of observation \n People are generally much more likely to act pro-socially in a public setting rather than in a private setting One explanation for this finding has to do with perceived status being publicly recognized as a pro-social individual often enhance one's self-image and desirability to be considered for inclusion in social groups \n Other research has shown that merely given people the \"illusion\" that they are being observed e g by hanging up posters of \"staring\" human eyes can generate significant changes in pro-social acts such as charitable giving and less littering Pictures of human eyes trigger an involuntary neural gaze detection mechanism which primes people to act pro-socially \n Influence of perception of responsibility and guilt \n Guilt \n has long been regarded as a motivator for prosocial behavior \n Extensive data from a study conducted by de Hooge \n demonstrates that when a secondary individual repairs a transgressors damage caused to victims the transgressors guilt feelings reparative intentions and prosocial behavior drastically diminish Thus reduction of guilt may have more to do with reparative actions broadly rather than necessarily prosocial behaviors taken on by oneself \n Social media in natural disasters \n Social media \n can also be a catalyst for prosocial behavior One example occurred during the relief efforts in the wake of the \n Thoku earthquake and tsunami \n off the coast of \n Japan \n when users turned to \n Facebook \n and \n Twitter \n to provide financial and emotional support via their social networks Direct donations to Japanese relief were possible on \n The Red Cross \n fan page on Facebook \n and via online discount sites like \n Groupon \n and \n LivingSocial \n Relation to mood and emotion \n Mood and prosocial behavior are closely linked People often experience the \"feel good-do good\" phenomena where being in a good mood increases helping behaviors Being in a good mood helps us to see the \"good\" in other people and prolongs our own good mood For example mood and work behaviors have frequently been examined in research studies show that positive mood at work is associated with more positive work-related behaviors e g helping co-workers \n Similarly prosocial behaviors increase positive mood \n Several studies have shown the benefits of volunteering and other prosocial behaviors on self-esteem \n life satisfaction \n and overall mental health \n Additionally negative mood can also impact prosocial behavior Research has shown that guilt often leads to prosocial behaviors whereas other negative mood states such as fear do not lead to the same prosocial behaviors \n A recent pilot study examined whether an intervention increasing prosocial behavior kind acts in young adults with social anxiety would both increase positive affect and decrease social anxiety in participants Participants randomly assigned to a 4-week Kind Acts intervention where individuals were instructed to engage in three kind acts each day twice a week over the week period showed both higher self-reported positive mood and increased satisfaction with relationships at the end of the intervention This intervention demonstrates ways in which prosocial behavior may be beneficial in improving mood and mental health \n Other research suggests that cultivating positive emotions such as \n gratitude \n may also facilitate prosocial behavior A study by Bartlett & DeSteno examined the ability of gratitude to shape costly prosocial behavior demonstrating that gratitude increases efforts to assist a benefactor even when such efforts are costly i e hedonically negative and that this increase is qualitatively different from efforts given from just general positive affective state They also show that gratitude can increase assistance provided to strangers not just close social ties \n Awe \n is another positive emotional state that has been closely linked to inspiring generosity and prosocial behavior Piff et al \n studied this phenomenon through experiments using economic and ethical-decision making games and explain \"When people experience awe they really want to share that experience with other people suggesting that it has this particularly viral component to it awe binds people togetherby causing people to want to share their positive experiences collectively with one another \" \n Psychopathy and lack of prosocial behavior \n Psychopathy \n In \n Hervey Cleckley \n described psychopathy as a disorder in which individuals often initially appear intelligent \n charming \n and even kind but are in fact \n egocentric \n grandiose \n and impulsive He described individuals who would on a whim leave their families to cross the country gambling drinking and fighting only to return and act as if nothing was out of the ordinary \n Today psychopathy is described as a \n personality disorder \n that is characterized by decreased \n anxiety \n fear and social closeness as well as increased \n impulsivity \n manipulativeness \n interpersonal dominance and \n aggression \n These traits lead to numerous types of antisocial behavior including high rates of substance abuse \n serial short term relationships \n and various forms of criminal behavior \n One common misconception about psychopathy though is that all psychopaths are serial killers or other vicious criminals In reality many researchers do not consider criminal behavior to be a criterion for the disorder although the role of criminality in the disorder is strongly debated \n Additionally psychopathy is being researched as a dimensional construct that is one extreme of normal range personality traits instead of a categorical disorder \n In regards to the lack of prosocial behavior in psychopathy there are several theories that have been proposed in the literature One theory suggests that psychopaths engage in less prosocial behavior and conversely more antisocial behavior because of a deficit in their ability to recognize fear in others particularly fearful facial expressions \n Because they are unable to recognize that their actions are causing another distress they continue that behavior in order to obtain some goal that benefits them A second theory proposes that psychopaths have a sense of \"altruistic punishment\" \n where they are willing to punish other individuals even if it means they will be harmed in some way There has also been an evolutionary theory proposed \n stating that psychopaths lack of prosocial behavior is an adaptive mating strategy in that it allows them to spread more of their genes while taking less responsibility for their offspring Finally there is some evidence that in some situations psychopaths behavior may not be antisocial but instead it may be more utilitarian \n than other individuals In a recent study Bartels & Pizarro found that when making decisions about traditional moral dilemmas such as the \n trolley problem \n individuals high in psychopathic traits actually make more utilitarian and therefore more moral in some views choices This finding is particularly interesting because it suggests that psychopaths who are often considered immoral or even evil may actually make better moral decisions than non-psychopaths The authors of this study conclude that individuals high in psychopathic traits are less influenced by their emotions and therefore make more \"mathematical\" decisions and choose the option that leads to the lowest number of deaths \n The theories discussed above are not intended to be a comprehensive list but instead to provide a sense of how psychopaths differ in their approach to social interactions As with most psychological/social phenomenon it is likely a combination of these factors that lead to psychopaths lack of prosocial behavior Further research is needed to determine the causal nature of any one of these individual deficits as well as if there is any way to help these individuals develop more prosocial patterns of behavior \n Helper's high \n Psychologists have shown that helping others can produce \"feel-good\" neurotransmitters such as \n oxytocin \n and that similar to any other pleasurable activity the act of volunteering giving and behaving pro-socially can become addictive \n Some work has been done on utilizing this principle through the concept of \n helper therapy \n in which therapeutic benefits are gleaned from assisting others Community health workers have been found to gain helper benefits that include positive feelings about self a sense of belonging valuable work experience and access to health information and skills through their prosocial vocation which may buffer against the various stressors inherent in this line of work \n In addition Helper therapy may also be highly beneficial for distressed adolescents experiencing suicidal thoughts Studies indicate that when help-seeking youth use online community forums the help-seekers often begin to provide support for other help seekers and develop a reciprocal prosocial community battling depression together \n Prosocial dissidence \n Stefano Passini and Davide Morselli argue that groups will obey authority so long as its system basis and demands are viewed as legitimate Passini and Morselli distinguish between \n anti-social \n disobedience which they see as destructive and prosocial disobedience which they see as constructive \"Disobedience becomes prosocial when it is enacted for the sake of the whole society including all its different levels and groups In contrast anti-social disobedience is enacted mainly in favour of one's own group in order to attain individual rights \" A main difference between anti-social and pro-social dissidence is the way that they relate to authority anti-social dissidents reject authority and disobey its norms and laws while pro-social dissidents understand the important roles that societal laws play in maintaining order but also recognize and address the flaws in authoritative reasoning Pro-social protests if viewed in a positive manner can increase freedoms and equality for the general public and improve democratic institutions \n Labor market outcomes \n Recent scientific research shows that individuals who volunteer have better labor market outcomes in terms of hiring opportunities and wages

individualspeople feel connected through similar work educational and religious training and lifestyle Mechanical solidarity normally operates in \"traditional\" and small scale societies \n In simpler societies e g \n tribal \n solidarity is usually based on \n kinship \n ties of familial networks Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between peoplea development which occurs in \"modern\" and \"industrial\" societies \n Definition it is \n social cohesion \n based upon the dependence individuals have on each other in more advanced societies \n Although individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interest the order and very solidarity of society depends on their reliance on each other to perform their specified tasks Organic here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts Thus social solidarity is maintained in more complex societies through the interdependence of its component parts e g farmers produce the food to feed the factory workers who produce the tractors that allow the farmer to produce the food \n Peter Kropotkin \n Tributes to the victims of \n Charlie Hebdo shooting \n at the \n Royal Villa of Monza \n Italy \n on January \n A connection between the biological and the social was of principal importance for the idea of solidarity as expressed by the anarchist ideologist and former Prince \n Peter Kropotkin \n In his most famous book \n Mutual Aid A Factor of Evolution \n written partly in response to Huxleyan Social Darwinism Kropotkin studied the use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies at their various stages as well as with animals According to him \n mutual aid \n or cooperation within a species has been an important factor in the evolution of social institutions Solidarity is essential for mutual aid supportive activity towards other people does not result from the expectation of reward but rather from instinctive feelings of solidarity \n In his introduction to the book Kropotkin wrote \"The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the next village-community period and the immense influence which these early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of mankind down to the present times induced me to extend my researches to the later historical periods as well especially to study that most interesting period the free medieval city republics whose universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet been duly appreciated And finally I have tried to indicate in brief the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts inherited by mankind from its extremely long evolution play even now in our modern society which is supposed to rest upon the principle \"every one for himself and the State for all \" but which it never has succeeded nor will succeed in realizing\" \n Kropotkin advocated an alternative economic and social system which would be coordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations with goods distributed in compliance with the physical needs of the individual rather than according to labour \n Use in philosophy \n Solidarity is an emerging concept in contemporary philosophy it is subject to ongoing studies in various subfields of \n ethics \n and \n political philosophy \n One notable approach in \n bioethics \n is to identify solidarity primarily as a three-tiered practice enacted at the interpersonal communal and contractual and legal levels \n This approach is driven by the quest to differentiate between the diverse applications of the concept and to clarify its meaning both historically and in terms of its potential as a fruitful concept for contemporary moral social and political issues \n Catholic social teaching \n Solidarity is an integral element of \n Catholic social teaching \n According to \n Pope Francis \n No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world the Brazilian people particularly the humblest among you can offer the world a valuable lesson in solidarity a word that is too often forgotten or silenced because it is uncomfortable I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice never tire of working for a more just world marked by greater solidarity \n The Church's teaching on solidarity is explained in the \n Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \n and briefly summarised in the \n Catechism of the Catholic Church \n The principle of solidarity also articulated in terms of \"friendship\" or \"social charity \" is a direct demand of human and Christian brotherhood \n Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of goods and remuneration for work \n Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of all the forms of solidarity solidarity of the poor among themselves between rich and poor of workers among themselves between employers and employees in a business solidarity among nations and peoples International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order world peace depends in part upon this \n The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods In spreading the spiritual goods of the faith the Church has promoted and often opened new paths for the development of temporal goods as well And so throughout the centuries has the Lord's saying been verified \"Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be yours as well \" \n Sociology

people's \n thoughts \n feelings \n and \n behaviors \n are influenced by the actual imagined or implied presence of others \n In this definition \n scientific \n refers to the \n empirical \n investigation using the \n scientific method \n The terms \n thoughts \n feelings \n and \n behaviors \n refer to \n psychological \n variables that can be measured in humans The statement that others' presence may be \n imagined \n or \n implied \n suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone such as when watching television or following internalized \n cultural norms \n Social psychologists typically explain \n human behavior \n as a result of the interaction of \n mental states \n and social \n situations \n Social psychologists examine factors that cause behaviors to unfold in a given way in the presence of others They study conditions under which certain behavior actions and feelings occur Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings thoughts beliefs intentions and goals are cognitively constructed and how these mental representations in turn influence our interactions with others \n Social psychology traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology During the years immediately following \n World War II \n there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists \n The two disciplines however have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years with sociologists focusing on \"macro variables\" e g social structure to a much greater extent than psychologists \n citation needed \n Nevertheless \n sociological approaches \n to psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area \n In addition to the split between psychology and sociology there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and \n European \n social psychologists As a generalization American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena see \n group dynamics \n Intrapersonal phenomena \n Attitudes \n Persuasion \n Social cognition \n Self-concept \n Interpersonal phenomena \n Social influence \n Group dynamics \n Interpersonal attraction \n Research \n Methods \n Ethics \n Replication crisis \n Famous experiments \n Academic journals \n Although there were some older treatises about social psychology such as those by Islamic philosopher \n Al-Farabi \n Alpharabius \n the discipline of social psychology as its modern-day definition began in the United States at the dawn of the 20th century By that time though the discipline had already developed a significant foundation Following the 18th century those in the emerging field of social psychology were concerned with developing concrete explanations for different aspects of human nature \n citation needed \n They desired to discover concrete cause and effect relationships that explained the social interactions in the world around them In order to do so they believed that the \n scientific method \n an empirically based scientific measure could be applied to human behavior \n The first published study in this area was an experiment in by \n Norman Triplett \n on the phenomenon of \n social facilitation \n During the 1930s many \n Gestalt \n psychologists most notably \n Kurt Lewin \n fled to the United States from Nazi Germany They were instrumental in developing the field as something separate from the \n behavioral \n and \n psychoanalytic \n schools that were dominant during that time and social psychology has always maintained the legacy of their interests in \n perception \n and \n cognition \n Attitudes \n and \n small group \n phenomena were the most commonly studied topics in this era \n citation needed \n During World War II social psychologists studied \n persuasion \n and \n propaganda \n for the U S military After the war researchers became interested in a variety of social problems including \n gender \n issues and \n racial prejudice \n Most notable revealing and contentious of these were the \n Stanley Milgram shock experiments \n on \n obedience to authority \n In the sixties there was growing interest in new topics such as \n cognitive dissonance \n bystander intervention \n and \n aggression \n By the 1970s however social psychology in America had reached a crisis There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior and how much science could be done in a cultural context \n This was also the time when a radical \n situationist \n approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology \n Throughout the 1980s and 1990s social psychology reached a more mature level Two of the areas social psychology matured in were theories and methods \n Careful \n ethical standards \n now regulate research \n Pluralistic \n and \n multicultural \n perspectives have emerged Modern researchers are interested in many phenomena but \n attribution \n social cognition \n and the self-concept are perhaps the greatest areas of growth in recent years Social psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in the social psychology of health education law and the workplace \n Intrapersonal phenomena \n Attitudes \n Attitude psychology \n In social psychology attitudes are defined as learned global evaluations of a person object place or issue that influence thought and action \n pageneeded \n Put more simply attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval favorability or unfavorability or as Bem put it likes and dislikes \n Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream or endorsing the values of a particular political party \n Social psychologists have studied attitude formation the structure of attitudes attitude change the function of attitudes and the relationship between attitudes and behavior Because people are influenced by the situation general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior For example for a variety of reasons a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day \n In recent times research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional self-reported attitude measures and \"implicit\" or unconscious attitudes For example experiments \n using the \n Implicit Association Test \n have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races even when their explicit responses reveal equal mindedness One study found that explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior in interracial interactions whereas implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior \n One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed first advanced by \n Abraham Tesser \n in is that strong likes and dislikes are rooted in our \n genetic make-up \n Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes as a result of inborn physical sensory and \n cognitive skills \n temperament and \n personality traits \n Whatever disposition nature elects to give us our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects our history of rewards and punishments the attitude that our parents friends and enemies express the social and cultural context in which we live and other types of experiences we have Obviously attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and negative attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli \n Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline such as \n conformity \n interpersonal attraction \n social perception and \n prejudice \n Persuasion \n Persuasion \n The topic of persuasion has received a great deal of attention in recent years Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude idea or behavior by rational or emotive means Persuasion relies on \"appeals\" rather than strong pressure or \n coercion \n Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process these are normally presented in five major categories \n who \n said \n what \n to \n whom \n and \n how \n The \n Communicator \n including \n credibility \n expertise \n trustworthiness \n and \n attractiveness \n The \n Message \n including varying degrees of \n reason \n emotion \n such as fear one-sided or two sided arguments and other types of informational content \n The \n Audience \n including a variety of \n demographics \n personality traits \n and \n preferences \n The Channel or \n Medium \n including the printed word radio television the internet or face-to-face interactions \n The Context including the environment group dynamics and preamble to the message \n clarification needed \n Dual-process theories \n of persuasion such as the \n elaboration likelihood model \n maintain that the persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes central and peripheral The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change but requires motivation to process The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change but does not require as much motivation to process An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin smiling and wearing a crisp clean shirt Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive but should not last as long as persuasion based on the central route If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed and their previous voting record this would be using the central route and would result in longer lasting change but would require a good deal of motivation to process \n Social cognition \n Social cognition \n Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive think about and remember information about others \n citation needed \n Much research rests on the assertion that people think about other people differently from non-social targets \n This assertion is supported by the social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism \n Person perception \n is the study of how people form impressions of others The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as \n interpersonal perception \n A major research topic in social cognition is attribution \n Attributions are the explanations we make for people's behavior either our own behavior or the behavior of others We can ascribe the locus of a behavior to either internal or external factors An \n internal \n or dispositional attribution assigns behavior to causes related to inner traits such as personality disposition character or ability An \n external \n or situational attribution involves situational elements such as the weather \n A second element attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to either stable or unstable factors whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances Finally we also attribute causes of behavior to either controllable or uncontrollable factors how much control one has over the situation at hand \n Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered For instance the \n fundamental attribution error \n is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations \n The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own \n The \n self-serving bias \n is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes and situational causes for failure particularly when self-esteem is threatened This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits and one's failures are due to situations including other people \n Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by \n believing in a just world \n blaming victims for their suffering and making \n defensive attributions \n which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality \n Researchers have found that mildly \n depressed \n individuals often lack this bias and actually have \n more realistic perceptions of reality \n as measured by the opinions of others \n Heuristics \n are cognitive short cuts Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision people rely on heuristics to save time and energy The \n availability heuristic \n occurs when people estimate the \n probability \n of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine As such vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias \n contradictory \n The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of \n Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers The \n hindsight bias \n is a \n false memory \n of having predicted events or an exaggeration of actual predictions after becoming aware of the outcome The \n confirmation bias \n is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions \n citation needed \n Another key concept in social cognition is the assumption that reality is too complex to easily discern As a result we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality \n Schemas \n are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing Schemas often operate \n automatically \n and unintentionally and can lead to biases in perception and memory Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man \n This type of schema is actually a \n stereotype \n a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people when incorrect an \n ultimate attribution error \n Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes prejudice and behavior \n discrimination \n Schemas for behaviors e g going to a restaurant doing laundry are known as \n scripts \n citation needed \n Self-concept \n Self-concept \n Self-concept is a term referring to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves However what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus the self-concept is made up of cognitive molecules called \n self-schemas \n beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information For example an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self the student would be one \"self \" who would process information pertinent to a student taking notes in class completing a homework assignment etc the athlete would be the \"self\" who processes information about things related to being an athlete recognizing an incoming pass aiming a shot etc These \"selves\" are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper \"self\" to process and react on it If a \"self\" is not part of one's identity then it is much more difficult for one to react For example a civilian may not know how to handle a hostile threat as a trained Marine would The Marine contains a \"self\" that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly whereas a civilian may not contain that self disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and furthermore debilitating them from acting accordingly Self-schemas are to an individuals total selfconcept as a hypothesis is to a theory or a book is to a library A good example is the body weight self-schema people who regard themselves as over or underweight or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect are considered \n schematics \n with respect to weight For these people a range of otherwise mundane events grocery shopping new clothes eating out or going to the beach can trigger thoughts about the self In contrast people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are \n a-schematic \n on that attribute \n It is rather clear that the self is a special object of our \n attention \n Whether one is mentally focused on a \n memory \n a \n conversation \n a foul smell the song that is stuck in one's head or this sentence \n consciousness \n is like a spotlight This \n spotlight \n can shine on only one object at a time but it can switch rapidly from one object to another and process the information out of \n awareness \n clarification needed \n In this spotlight the self is front and center things relating to the self have the spotlight more often \n citation needed \n The self's ABCs are affect behavior and cognition An affective or emotional question How do people evaluate themselves enhance their self-image and maintain a secure sense of identity? A behavioral question How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands? A \n cognitive \n question How do individuals become themselves build a self-concept and uphold a stable sense of identity? \n Affective forecasting is the process of \n predicting \n how one would feel in response to future \n emotional \n events Studies done by \n Timothy Wilson \n and \n Daniel Gilbert \n in have shown that people overestimate the strength of reaction to anticipated positive and negative life events that they actually feel when the event does occur \n There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior Daryl Bem's self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior \n Leon Festinger \n 's \n social comparison theory \n is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions \n There is also the \n facial feedback hypothesis \n that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion \n The fields of social psychology and \n personality \n have merged over the years and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena In contrast with traditional personality theory however social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits Much research focuses on the \n self-concept \n which is a person's understanding of his or her self The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component known as the \n self-schema \n and an evaluative component the \n self-esteem \n The need to maintain a healthy \n self-esteem \n is recognized as a central human \n motivation \n in the field of social psychology \n citation needed \n Self-efficacy \n beliefs are associated with the self-schema These are expectations that performance on some task will be effective and successful Social psychologists also study such self-related processes as \n self-control \n and \n self-presentation \n citation needed \n People develop their self-concepts by varied means including \n introspection \n feedback from others \n self-perception \n and social comparison By comparing themselves to relevant others people gain information about themselves and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem Social comparisons can be either \"upward\" or \"downward \" that is comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability or lower in status or ability \n Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem \n citation needed \n Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior Psychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards e g money tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process a phenomenon known as \n overjustification \n People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered \n This is an important exception to \n reinforcement \n theory \n Interpersonal phenomena \n Social influence \n Social influence \n Social influence is an overarching term given to describe the persuasive effects people have on each other It is seen as a fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion The three main areas of social influence include \n conformity \n compliance \n and \n obedience \n Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups \n The first major area of social influence is conformity Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group The identity of members within a group i e status similarity expertise as well as cohesion prior commitment and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual Individual variation among group members plays a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform \n Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations as is nonconformity in other situations \n Which line matches the first line A B or C? In the \n Asch conformity experiments \n people frequently followed the majority judgment even when the majority was objectively wrong \n The second major area of social influence research is compliance \n Compliance \n refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person The \n foot-in-the-door technique \n is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor e g asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars A related trick is the \n bait and switch \n The third major form of social influence is \n obedience \n this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the \n Milgram study \n wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command \n An unusual kind of social influence is the \n self-fulfilling prophecy \n This is a prediction that in being made actually causes itself to become true For example in the \n stock market \n if it is widely believed that a \n crash \n is imminent investors may lose confidence sell most of their stock and thus actually cause the crash Similarly people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior \n Group dynamics \n Group dynamics \n A \n group \n can be defined as two or more individuals that are connected to each another by \n social relationships \n Groups tend to interact influence each other and share a common identity They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from \n aggregates \n Norms \n Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow e g saying thank you shaking hands \n Roles \n Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group e g the oldest sibling who may have additional responsibilities in the family \n Relations \n Patterns of liking within the group and also differences in prestige or status e g leaders popular people \n Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features and do not qualify as true social groups People waiting in line to get on a bus for example do not constitute a group \n citation needed \n Groups are important not only because they offer social support resources and a feeling of belonging but because they supplement an individual's self-concept To a large extent humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their \n social identity \n The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group \n On the other hand such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society \n Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping while the processes of social facilitation and \n group polarization \n encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group \n Groups often moderate and improve \n decision making \n citation needed \n and are frequently relied upon for these benefits such as in committees and juries A number of group biases however can interfere with effective decision making For example group polarization formerly known as the \"risky shift \" occurs when people polarize their views in a more extreme direction after group discussion More problematic is the phenomenon of \n groupthink \n This is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus caused by members of a group failing to promote views which are not consistent with the views of other members Groupthink occurs in a variety of situations including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader Janis offered the \n Bay of Pigs Invasion \n as a historical case of groupthink \n Groups also affect performance and \n productivity \n Social facilitation for example is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others Social facilitation increases the \n dominant response \n ' \n s likelihood which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks \n citation needed \n In contrast \n social loafing \n is the tendency of individuals to \n slack off \n when working in a group Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see \n unreliable source? \n Social psychologists study group-related collective phenomena such as the behavior of \n crowds \n An important concept in this area is \n deindividuation \n a reduced state of \n self-awareness \n that can be caused by feelings of anonymity Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior It is common in crowds and mobs but it can also be caused by a disguise a uniform alcohol dark environments or online anonymity \n citation needed \n Social psychologists study interactions within \n groups \n and between both groups and individuals \n Interpersonal attraction \n Interpersonal attraction \n A major area in the study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction This refers to all forces that lead people to like each other establish relationships and in some cases fall in \n love \n Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists but many still continue to experiment and do research to find out more One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are The more similar two people are in general attitudes backgrounds environments worldviews and other traits the more probable an attraction is possible \n full citation needed \n Physical attractiveness \n is an important element of romantic relationships particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of \n passion \n Later on similarity and other compatibility factors become more important and the type of love people experience shifts from \n passionate \n to \n companionate \n Robert Sternberg \n has suggested that there are actually three components of love intimacy passion and commitment \n When two or more people experience all three they are said to be in a state of consummate love \n According to \n social exchange theory \n relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis If one partner's costs begin to outweigh his or her benefits that person may leave the relationship especially if there are good alternatives available This theory is similar to the \n minimax principle \n proposed by mathematicians and economists despite the fact that human relationships are not \n zero-sum games \n With time long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange \n citation needed \n Research \n Methods \n Social psychology is an \n empirical \n science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses both in the laboratory and in the field Careful attention to sampling research design and \n statistical analysis \n is important results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the \n Journal of Experimental Social Psychology \n Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin \n and the \n Journal of Personality and Social Psychology \n Social psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as \n Psychological Science \n and \n Science \n Experimental methods \n involve the researcher altering a variable in the environment and measuring the effect on another variable An example would be allowing two groups of children to play violent or nonviolent videogames and then observing their subsequent level of aggression during free-play period A valid experiment is controlled and uses \n random assignment \n Correlational methods \n examine the statistical association between two naturally occurring variables For example one could correlate the amount of violent television children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at school Note that this study would \n not \n prove that violent TV causes aggression in children it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV \n Observational methods \n are purely descriptive and include \n naturalistic observation \n \"contrived\" observation participant observation and archival analysis These are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenon An example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground with a videocamera perhaps and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayed \n Whenever possible social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation Controlled experiments require the manipulation of one or more \n independent variables \n in order to examine the effect on a \n dependent variable \n Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in \n internal validity \n meaning that they are free from the influence of \n confounding \n or extraneous variables and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship However the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in \n external validity \n or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population There is usually a trade-off between experimental control \n internal validity \n and being able to generalize to the population \n external validity \n Because it is usually impossible to test everyone research tends to be conducted on a \n sample \n of persons from the wider \n population \n Social psychologists frequently use \n survey \n research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity Surveys use various forms of \n random sampling \n to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables However new statistical methods like \n structural equation modeling \n are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data \n citation needed \n Some psychologists including Dr David Sears have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole \n Regardless of which method has been chosen to be used the results are of high importance Results need to be used to evaluate the hypothesis of the research that is done These results should either confirm or reject the original hypothesis that was predicted There are two different types of testing social psychologists use in order to test their results Statistics and probability testing define a \n significant \n finding that can be as low as 5% or less likely to be due to chance \n Replications \n are important to ensure that the result is valid and not due to chance or some feature of a particular sample \n False positive \n conclusions often resulting from the \n pressure to publish \n or the author's own \n confirmation bias \n are a hazard in the field \n Ethics \n The goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior For this reason many social psychology experiments utilize \n deception \n to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study Deception may include false cover stories false participants known as confederates or stooges false feedback given to the participants and so on \n clarification needed \n The practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical and that other research strategies e g \n role-playing \n should be used instead Unfortunately research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity \n citation needed \n In addition to deception experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations e g the \n Milgram experiment \n and \n Stanford prison experiment \n and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons \n To protect the rights and well-being of research participants and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior virtually all social psychology research must pass an \n ethical \n review process At most colleges and universities this is conducted by an ethics committee or \n Institutional Review Board \n This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study \n Furthermore a process of \n informed consent \n is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment \n clarification needed \n and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time A \n debriefing \n is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures \n clarification needed \n Today most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities \n citation needed \n Replication crisis \n replication crisis \n Social psychology has recently found itself at the center of a \" \n replication crisis \n \" due to some research findings proving difficult to replicate Replication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in all fields of science However several factors have combined to put social psychology at the center of the current controversy \n Firstly \n questionable research practices \n QRP have been identified as common in the field Such practices while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses sample size or data management typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones \n Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent \n One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the \n feeling the future controversy \n has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this study could at least in part be attributed to QRP \n Secondly social psychology has found itself at the center of several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research Most notably the admitted data fabrication by \n Diederik Stapel \n as well as allegations against others However most scholars acknowledge that fraud is perhaps the lesser contribution to replication crises \n citation needed \n Third several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis For example the scientific journal \n Judgment and Decision Making \n has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the \n unconscious thought theory \n Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning \n These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by \n Daniel Kahneman \n Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate A recent special edition of the journal Social Psychology focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate \n A special edition of the journal \n Perspectives on Psychological Science \n also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology \n It is important to note that this replication crisis does not mean that social psychology is unscientific \n citation needed \n Rather this process is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned \n The consequence is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid such as social priming have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications \n Famous experiments \n The \n Milgram experiment \n The experimenter E persuades the participant T to give what the participant believes are painful electric shocks to another participant L who is actually an actor Many participants continued to give shocks despite pleas for mercy from the actor \n The \n Asch conformity experiments \n demonstrated the power of conformity in small groups with a line length estimation task that was designed to be extremely easy \n In well over a third of the trials participants conformed to the majority who had been instructed to provide incorrect answers even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment Additional manipulations to the experiment showed participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experiment \n Also participant conformity increased substantially as the number of incorrect individuals increased from one to three and remained high as the incorrect majority grew Participants with three incorrect opponents made mistakes 8% of the time while those with one or two incorrect opponents made mistakes only 6% and 6% of the time respectively \n Muzafer Sherif \n 's \n Robbers' Cave Experiment \n divided boys into two competing groups to explore how much hostility and aggression would emerge Sherif's explanation of the results became known as realistic group conflict theory because the intergroup conflict was induced through competition over resources \n Inducing cooperation and \n superordinate goals \n later reversed this effect \n In \n Leon Festinger \n 's cognitive dissonance experiment participants were asked to perform a boring task They were divided into groups and given two different pay scales At the study's end some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie The first group $1 later reported liking the task better than the second group $20 Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task Being paid $20 provides a reason for doing the boring task therefore no dissonance \n One of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the \n Milgram experiment \n which studied how far people would go to obey an \n authority \n figure Following the events of \n The Holocaust \n in World War II the experiment showed that most normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer \n Albert Bandura \n 's \n Bobo doll experiment \n demonstrated how aggression is learned by \n imitation \n This set of studies fueled debates regarding \n media violence \n which continue to be waged among scholars \n In the \n Stanford prison study \n by \n Philip Zimbardo \n a simulated exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role In just a few days the \"guards\" became brutal and cruel and the prisoners became miserable and compliant This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits \n However to this day it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study For example it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour \n and that the participants' personality influenced their reactions in a variety of ways including how long they chose to remain in the study \n citation needed \n One of the

ethics \n of \n altruism \n derived from the \n human condition \n Humanity differs from mere \n justice \n in that there is a level of altruism towards individuals included in humanity more so than the fairness found in justice \n That is humanity and the acts of love altruism and social intelligence are typically individual strengths while fairness is generally expanded to all Peterson & Seligman in \n Character Strengths and Virtues A Handbook and Classification \n class humanity as one of six virtues that are consistent across all cultures \n The concept goes back to the development of \"humane\" or \" \n humanist \n \" philosophy during the \n Renaissance \n with predecessors in 13th-century \n scholasticism \n stressing a concept of basic \n human dignity \n inspired by \n Aristotelianism \n and the concept of \n humanitarianism \n in the \n early modern period \n and resulted in modern notions such as \" \n human rights \n \" \n Historical perspectives \n Confucian philosophy \n Greek philosophy \n Abrahamic religion \n Strengths of humanity \n Love \n Kindness \n Social Intelligence \n Psychological research on humanity virtue \n Virtue and wellbeing \n Notes \n Historical perspectives \n Confucian philosophy \n Confucius \n said that humanity or \n Ren \n is a love of people stating if you want to make a stand help others make a stand \n That is the Confucian theory of humanity exemplifies the golden rule It is so central to Confucian thought that it appears times in the \n Analects \n Similar to the Christian process of seeking God Confucius teaches seeking Ren to a point of seemingly divine mastery until you are equal to or better than your teacher \n The Confucian concept of Ren encompasses both love and altruism \n Greek philosophy \n Plato \n and \n Aristotle \n both wrote extensively on the subject of virtues though neither ever wrote on humanity as a virtue despite highly valuing love and kindness two of the strengths of humanity Plato and Aristotle considered \"courage justice temperance\" and \"generosity wit friendliness truthfulness magnificence and greatness of soul\" to be the sole virtues respectively \n Abrahamic religion \n Humanity is one of \n Thomas Aquinas \n ' \"Seven Heavenly Virtues \" \n Beyond that humanity was so important in some positivist Christian cultures that it was to be capitalized like God \n Kindness altruism and love are all mentioned in the bible Proverbs \"states the desire of a man is his kindness \" On the topic of altruism emphasis is placed on helping strangers Hebrews and the biblical adage \"it is better to give than to receive\" Acts \n Strengths of humanity \n Love \n Love has many different definitions ranging from a set of purely biological and chemical processes to a religious concept As a character strength love is a mutual feeling between two people characterized by attachment comfort and generally positive feelings It can be broken down into categories love between a child and their parents love for your friends and romantic love \n Having love as a strength is not about the capacity to love as such it is about being involved in a loving relationship \n Love in the psychological sense is most often studied in terms of attachment to others A degree of controversy surrounds defining and researching love in this way as it takes away the mystery of love \n Because love is mysterious to an extent it is most often studied in terms of attachment theory because it can be studied in the way across ages In infants attachment is studied through the Strange Situation Test Attachment to an individual usually the mother is determined by how distressed the infant becomes when the mother is taken out of the experimental setting \n There are several models of adult attachment including the Adult Attachment Interviews Kaplan & Main Adult Attachment Prototypes Hazan & Shaver and more Generally adult attachment models focus on the \n mental representation \n of the visible signs of attachment seen in infants \n Evidence in support of the benefits of love are seen in the negative affect states that result from lacking love Orphaned children have been targeted in studies about negative attributes resulting from lack of attachment Smyke \n et al \n found that children raised in an environment that didnt allow children to become attached to their preferred caregivers experienced \n attachment disorders \n Additionally individuals who develop securely attached have a lower likelihood of depression high-self esteem and less likelihood of divorce \n Kindness \n The strength kindness encompasses most related terms that evoke feelings of altruism generosity helpfulness and a general desire to help people That is a disposition for helping humanity The following statements are from the \n Values in Action \n VIA psychological assessment aimed at determining people's strengths in kindness others are just as important to me giving is more important than receiving I care for the ungrateful as well as the grateful \n Kindness as a part of humanity is deeply rooted in philosophical and religious traditions each having words for the altruistic love aspect of kindness such as \n agape \n in Greek \n chesed \n in Hebrew and the Latin word \n philantropia \n the root of the word \"philanthropy \" \n Kindness is so valued as a strength beyond religious and theoretical concepts that it is advocated through school community service programs and national programs like AmeriCorps Additionally while gender differences in kindness are statistically significant they are minimal and the methods of testing used may not always have construct validity \n Kindness is most often measured on a case by case measure and not usually as a trait The Self-Report Altruism Scale and the Altruism Facet Scale for Agreeableness Measure of the \n Revised NEO Personality Inventory \n NEO-PI-R psychological assessment are often used to ask people how often they engage in altruistic behaviors and gauge their concern for others \n The former however only asks about specific altruistic acts leaving out a wide range of altruistic behaviors \n There are numerous benefits from kindness and altruism on both sides of the action For some the motivation to be kind comes from a place of egoistic motivation and thus the benefit to them is the positive affect state they receive from the action \n Another study found that the process of being kind develops pro-social skills in children which positively effects their attachments and relationships \n Additionally volunteerism in the elderly has shown to lead to decreased risk of early death and mental health benefits \n One thing to note is the difference between altruism as a trait and as an act \n A good example of kindness is a program founded by Bahadur Chand Gupta which provides free airplane ride experience to the underprivileged and poor Indians for just \n USD \n Social Intelligence \n Social intelligence is the most modern of the three strengths associated with humanity The Character Strengths and Virtues CSV psychological assessment defines social intelligence as the ability to understand relationships with other people including the social relationships involved in intimacy and trust persuasion group membership and political power \n Intelligence has many psychological definitions from Weschlers intelligence to the various theories of multiple intelligence The CSV divides intelligence into hot and cold hot intelligence being those intelligences related to active emotional processes Individuals with high social intelligence are very self-aware and effective organizers and leaders \n Additionally it combines elements of the other two hot intelligences personal and emotional intelligence Personal intelligence being the internal counterpart to social intelligence and emotional intelligence being the capacity to understand emotions The CSV highlights three social intelligence measurement scales Factor Based Social Intelligence Tasks Psychological Mindedness Assessment Procedure and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional intelligence Test \n Social Intelligence research is limited however there is much literature on the characteristics associated with social intelligence Zaccaro \n et al \n found social intelligence and perceptiveness to be integral to effective leadership that is good leaders are social experts \n Emotional intelligence too plays a role in leadership Another study found that emotional intelligence enables leaders to better understand their followers thereby enhancing their ability to influence them \n Psychological research on humanity virtue \n Virtue and wellbeing \n Although only a relatively new field of inquiry for psychological researchers \n character strengths \n and \n virtues \n have been consistently measured in psychometric surveys and have been shown to be positively associated with psychological and subjective wellbeing \n What is more even among those who endorse a spiritual/theistic worldview these salutary associations appear to be better explained by humanity/civility rather than endorsing a faith in a supernatural being \n Notes \n ^ \n Peterson & Seligman p \n ^ \n Peterson & Seligman p \n ^ \n a \n b \n Peterson & Seligman p

possible \n Early group selection models were flawed because they assumed that genes acted independently but genetically-based interactions among individuals are ubiquitous in group formation because genes must cooperate for the benefit of association in groups to enhance the fitness of group members \n Additionally group selection on the level of the species is flawed because it is difficult to see how selective pressures would be applied selection in social species of groups against other groups rather than the species entire seems to be the level at which selective pressures are plausible On the other hand kin selection is accepted as an explanation of altruistic behavior \n Since the 1990s group selection models have seen a resurgence \n Some biologists argue that kin selection and multilevel selection are both needed to \"obtain a complete understanding of the evolution of a social behavior system\" \n In three authors including \n E O Wilson \n argued for multi-level selection including group selection to correct what they saw as deficits in the explanatory power of \n inclusive fitness \n The response was a back-lash from other evolutionary biologists who argued \"that their arguments are based upon a misunderstanding of evolutionary theory and a misrepresentation of the empirical literature\" \n Multilevel selection theory \n In \n David Sloan Wilson \n and \n Elliott Sober \n argued that the case against group selection had been overstated They considered whether groups can have functional organization in the same way as individuals and consequently whether groups can be \"vehicles\" for \n selection \n They do not posit evolution on the level of the species but selective pressures that winnow out small groups within a species e g groups of social insects or primates Groups that cooperate better might survive and reproduce more than those that did not Resurrected in this way Wilson & Sober's new group selection is called multilevel selection theory \n David Sloan Wilson \n and \n Elliott Sober \n 's Multilevel \n Selection \n Model illustrated by a nested set of Russian \n matryoshka dolls \n Wilson himself compared his model to such a set \n Wilson compared the layers of competition and evolution to nested sets of Russian \n matryoshka dolls \n The lowest level is the \n genes \n next come the \n cells \n then the \n organism \n level and finally the groups The different levels function cohesively to maximize fitness or reproductive success The theory asserts that selection for the group level involving competition between groups must outweigh the individual level involving individuals competing within a group for a group-beneficiating trait to spread \n Multilevel selection theory focuses on the phenotype because it looks at the levels that selection directly acts upon \n For humans social norms can be argued to reduce individual level variation and competition thus shifting selection to the group level Wilson ties the multilevel selection theory regarding humans to another theory \n gene-culture coevolution \n by acknowledging that culture seems to characterize a group-level mechanism for human groups to adapt to environmental changes \n MLS theory can be used to evaluate the balance between group selection and individual selection in specific cases \n An experiment by William Muir compared egg productivity in hens showing that a hyper-aggressive strain had been produced through individual selection leading to many fatal attacks after only six generations by implication it could be argued that group selection must have been acting to prevent this in real life \n Group selection has most often been postulated in humans and notably \n eusocial \n Hymenoptera \n that make cooperation a driving force of their adaptations over time and have a unique system of inheritance involving \n haplodiploidy \n that allows the colony to function as an individual while only the queen reproduces \n Wilson & Sober's work revived interest in multilevel selection In a article \n E O Wilson \n argued that kin selection could no longer be thought of as underlying the evolution of extreme sociality for two reasons First he suggested the argument that \n haplodiploid \n inheritance as in the Hymenoptera creates a strong selection pressure towards nonreproductive castes is mathematically flawed \n Second \n eusociality \n no longer seems to be confined to the hymenopterans increasing numbers of highly social taxa have been found in the years since Wilson's foundational text on sociobiology was published in \n including a variety of insect species as well as two rodent species the \n naked mole-rat \n and the \n Damaraland mole rat \n Wilson suggests the equation for \n Hamilton's rule \n rb > c \n where b represents the benefit to the recipient of altruism c the cost to the altruist and r their degree of relatedness should be replaced by the more general equation \n rb \n k \n + b \n e \n > c \n in which b \n k \n is the benefit to kin b in the original equation and b \n e \n is the benefit accruing to the group as a whole He then argues that in the present state of the evidence in relation to social insects it appears that b \n e \n >rb \n k \n so that altruism needs to be explained in terms of selection at the colony level rather than at the kin level However kin selection and group selection are not distinct processes and the effects of multi-level selection are already accounted for in Hamilton's rule \n rb \n > \n c \n provided that an expanded definition of \n r \n not requiring Hamilton's original assumption of direct genealogical relatedness is used as proposed by E O Wilson himself \n Other arguments \n Spatial populations of predators and prey show restraint of reproduction at equilibrium both individually \n and through social communication \n as originally proposed by Wynne-Edwards While these spatial populations do not have well-defined groups for group selection the local spatial interactions of organisms in transient groups are sufficient to lead to a kind of multi-level selection There is however as yet no evidence that these processes operate in the situations where Wynne-Edwards posited them Rauch et al 's analysis \n for example is of a host-parasite situation which was recognised as one where group selection was possible even by \n E O Wilson \n in a treatise broadly hostile to the whole idea of group selection \n Specifically the parasites do not individually moderate their transmission rather more transmissible variants \"continually arise and grow rapidly for many generations but eventually go extinct before dominating the system \" \n A variant of group selection theory rooted in the idea of population viscosity limited offspring dispersal first proposed by Hamilton is widely present in natural populations This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection kin selection kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level However early theoretical models by D S Wilson et al \n and Taylor \n showed that pure population viscosity cannot lead to cooperation and altruism This is because any benefit generated by kin cooperation is exactly cancelled out by kin competition additional offspring from cooperation are eliminated by local competition However this exact cancelling out also suggests that any additional benefit of local cooperation would be sufficient to allow cooperation to evolve \n Mitteldorf and D S Wilson later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of cooperation and altruism \n By assuming individual differences in adaptations Yang further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruism even if the population does not fluctuate This is because local competition among more individuals resulting from local altruism increases the average local fitness of the individuals that survive \n Gene-culture coevolution in humans \n Main articles \n Dual inheritance theory \n and \n cultural group selection \n Humanity has developed extremely rapidly arguably through \n gene-culture coevolution \n leading to complex \n cultural \n artefacts like the \n gopuram \n of the Sri Mariammam temple Singapore \n Gene-culture coevolution \n also called dual inheritance theory is a modern hypothesis applicable mostly to humans that combines evolutionary biology and modern sociobiology to indicate group selection \n It treats culture as a separate evolutionary system that acts in parallel to the usual genetic evolution to transform human traits It is believed that this approach of combining genetic influence with cultural influence over several generations is not present in the other hypotheses such as reciprocal altruism and kin selection making gene-culture evolution one of the strongest realistic hypotheses for group selection Fehr provides evidence of group selection taking place in humans presently with experimentation through logic games such as prisoners dilemma the type of thinking that humans have developed many generations ago \n Gene-culture coevolution allows humans to develop highly distinct adaptations to the local pressures and environments more quickly than with genetic evolution alone \n Robert Boyd \n and \n Peter J Richerson \n two strong proponents of cultural evolution postulate that the act of social learning or learning in a group as done in group selection allows human populations to accrue information over many generations \n This leads to cultural evolution of behaviors and technology alongside genetic evolution Boyd and Richerson believe that the ability to collaborate evolved during the Middle \n Pleistocene \n a million years ago in response to a rapidly changing climate \n In \n Herbert Gintis \n examined cultural evolution statistically offering evidence that societies that promote pro-social norms have higher survival rates than societies that do not \n Differing evolutionarily stable strategies ESSs \n The problem with group selection is that for a whole group to get a single trait it must spread through the whole group first by regular \n evolution \n But as \n J L Mackie \n suggested when there are many different groups each with a different \n Evolutionarily Stable Strategy \n ESS there is selection between the different ESSs since some are worse than others \n For example a group where altruism was universal would outcompete a group where every creature acted in its own interest but a mixed group of altruists and non-altruists would be vulnerable to cheating by non-altruists within the group \n Implications in population biology \n Social behaviors such as \n altruism \n and group relationships can impact many aspects of population dynamics such as \n intraspecific competition \n and \n interspecific \n interactions In Darwin argued that group selection occurs when the benefits of cooperation or altruism between subpopulations are greater than the individual benefits of egotism within a subpopulation \n This supports the idea of multilevel selection but kinship also plays an integral role because many subpopulations are composed of closely related individuals An example of this can be found in lions which are simultaneously cooperative and territorial \n Within a pride males protect the pride from outside males and females who are commonly sisters communally raise cubs and hunt However this cooperation seems to be density dependent When resources are limited group selection favors prides that work together to hunt When prey is abundant cooperation is no longer beneficial enough to outweigh the disadvantages of altruism and hunting is no longer cooperative \n Interactions between different species can also be affected by multilevel selection Predator-prey relationships can also be affected Individuals of certain monkey species howl to warn the group of the approach of a predator \n The evolution of this trait benefits the group by providing protection but could be disadvantageous to the individual if the howling draws the predator's attention to them By affecting these interspecific interactions multilevel and kinship selection can change the population dynamics of an ecosystem \n Multilevel selection attempts to explain the evolution of altruistic behavior in terms of \n quantitative genetics \n Increased frequency or \n fixation \n of altruistic alleles can be accomplished through kin selection in which individuals engage in altruistic behavior to promote the fitness of genetically similar individuals such as siblings However this can lead to \n inbreeding depression \n which typically lowers the overall fitness of a population However if altruism were to be selected for through an emphasis on benefit to the group as opposed to relatedness and benefit to kin both the altruistic trait and genetic diversity could be preserved However relatedness should still remain a key consideration in studies of multilevel selection Experimentally imposed multilevel selection on Japanese quail was more effective by an order of magnitude on closely related kin groups than on randomized groups of individuals \n Criticism \n The use of the \n Price equation \n to support group selection was challenged by van Veelen in arguing that it is based on invalid mathematical assumptions \n Richard Dawkins \n and other advocates of the \n gene-centered view of evolution \n remain unconvinced about group selection \n In particular Dawkins suggests that group selection fails to make an appropriate distinction between replicators and vehicles \n The psychologist \n Steven Pinker \n concluded that \"group selection has no useful role to play in psychology or social science\" as it \"is not a precise implementation of the theory of natural selection as it is say in \n genetic algorithms \n or \n artificial life \n simulations Instead it is a loose metaphor more like the struggle among kinds of tires or telephones \" \n The evolutionary biologist \n Jerry Coyne \n summarized the arguments in \n The New York Times \n in non-technical terms as follows \n Group selection isn't widely accepted by evolutionists for several reasons First it's not an efficient way to select for traits like altruistic behavior that are supposed to be detrimental to the individual but good for the group Groups divide to form other groups much less often than organisms reproduce to form other organisms so group selection for altruism would be unlikely to override the tendency of each group to quickly lose its altruists through natural selection favoring cheaters Further little evidence exists that selection on groups has promoted the evolution of any trait Finally other more plausible evolutionary forces like direct selection on individuals for reciprocal support could have made humans prosocial These reasons explain why only a few biologists like David Sloan Wilson and E O Wilson no relation advocate group selection as the evolutionary source of cooperation"},

Pledge should not obscure two important consequences resulting from increased charitable donations First the Giving Pledge erodes the federal tax base particularly the federal estate tax base Second the Giving Pledge can be satisfied by gifts and bequests to family-controlled private foundations While some private foundations are commendable institutions pursuing important charitable objectives others are not \n Warren Buffett and Bill Gates Sr have been vigorous supporters of the federal estate tax In this sense there is considerable irony in the fact that Giving Pledgers avoid all federal estate taxes on the money they leave to charity Indeed much of the Giving Pledgers wealth consists of appreciated stock for which they have paid no federal income tax \n Mr Buffett and Mr Gates Sr have spoken eloquently of the need for wealthy individuals to repay the public for the government services that made their wealth possible A Giving Pledger or other charitable donor who leaves

{"theme.id": 7, "title": "Charity (practice)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(practice)", "depth": 1, "text": "Charity practice \n Illustration of charity \n The practice of \n charity \n means the voluntary giving of help to those in need as a \n humanitarian \n act \n Etymology \n Practice \n Criticism \n Charity in Christianity \n Tzedakah in Judaism \n Zakat and Sadaqa in Islam \n Dna in Indian religions \n Further reading \n Etymology \n The word \n charity \n originated in late \n Old English \n to mean a \" \n Christian \n love of one's fellows \" \n and up until at least the beginning of the \n 20th century \n this meaning remained synonymous with \n charity \n Aside from this original meaning \n charity \n is etymologically linked to Christianity with the word originally entering into the \n English language \n through the \n Old French \n word \" \n charit \n \" which was derived from the \n Latin \n \" \n caritas \n \" a word commonly used in the \n Vulgate \n New Testament \n to translate the Greek word \n agape \n a distinct form of \" \n love \n \" \n see the article \n Charity virtue \n Over time the meaning of \n charity \n has shifted from one of \"Christian love\" to that of \"providing for those in need generosity and giving \" \n a transition which began with the Old French word \n charit \n Thus while the older \n Douay-Rheims \n and \n King James \n versions of the \n Bible \n translate instances of \" \n agape \n \" such as those that appear in \n Corinthians \n as \" \n charity \n \" modern English versions of the Bible typically translate \" \n agape \n \" as \" \n love \n \" \n Practice \n Alms \n A Hindu Woman Giving Alms painting by \n Raja Ravi Varma \n Charitable giving is the act of giving money goods or time to the unfortunate either directly or by means of a \n charitable trust \n or other worthy cause \n Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms The name stems from the most obvious expression of the virtue of charity giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive The impoverished particularly those widowed or orphaned and the ailing or injured are generally regarded as the proper recipients of charity The people who cannot support themselves and lack outside means of support sometimes become \" \n beggars \n \" directly soliciting aid from strangers encountered in public \n Some groups regard charity as being distributed towards other members from within their particular group Although giving to those nearly connected to oneself is sometimes called charityas in the saying \"Charity begins at home\"normally charity denotes giving to those not related with \n filial piety \n and like terms for supporting one's family and friends Indeed treating those related to the giver as if they were strangers in need of charity has led to the figure of speech \"as cold as charity\"providing for one's relatives as if they were strangers without affection \n Most forms of charity are concerned with providing basic necessities such as food water clothing healthcare and shelter but other actions may be performed as charity visiting the imprisoned or the homebound ransoming captives educating orphans even social movements Donations to causes that benefit the unfortunate indirectly such as donations to fund cancer research are also charity \n With regards to religious aspects the recipient of charity may offer to pray for the benefactor In medieval Europe it was customary to feast the poor at the funeral in return for their prayers for the deceased Institutions may commemorate benefactors by displaying their names up to naming buildings or even the institution itself after the benefactors If the recipient makes material return of more than a token value the transaction is normally not called charity \n In the past \n which? \n century many \n charitable organizations \n have created a \"charitable model\" in which donators give to conglomerates give to recipients Examples of this include the \n Make a Wish Foundation \n John Cena holds the title for most wishes granted by a single individual with over wishes and the \n World Wildlife Fund \n Today some charities have modernized and allow people to donate online through websites such as \n JustGiving \n Originally charity entailed the benefactor directly giving the goods to the receiver This practice was continued by some individuals for example \" \n CNN Hero \n \" \n Sal Dimiceli \n and service organizations such as the \n Jaycees \n With the rise of more \n social peer-to-peer processes \n many charities are moving away from the charitable model and starting to adopt this more direct donator to recipient approach Examples of this include \n Global Giving \n direct funding of community development projects in developing countries \n DonorsChoose \n for US-based projects \n PureCharity \n Kiva \n funding loans administered by microfinance organizations in developing countries and \n Zidisha \n funding individual microfinance borrowers directly \n Institutions evolved to carry out the labor of assisting the poor and these institutions called \n charities \n provide the bulk of charitable giving today in terms of monetary value These include \n orphanages \n food banks \n religious institutes \n dedicated to care of the poor \n hospitals \n organizations that visit the homebound and imprisoned and many others Such institutions allow those whose time or inclination does not lend themselves to directly care for the poor to enable others to do so both by providing money for the work and supporting them while they do the work Institutions can also attempt to more effectively sort out the actually needy from those who fraudulently claim charity Early Christians particularly recommended the care of the unfortunate to the charge of the local bishop \n There have been examinations of who gives more to charity One study conducted in the United States found that as a percentage of income charitable giving increased as income decreased The poorest fifth of Americans for example gave away 3% of their income while the wealthiest fifth gave away 1% In absolute terms this was an average of $453 on an average income of $10 compared to $3 on an income of $158 \n Psychological research has found that among several factors moral norms and standards in particular influence an individual's inclination to donate to charity \n Criticism \n Critics of charitable giving contend that simply transferring gifts or money to disadvantaged people has negative long-term effects The online microlending organization \n Zidisha \n published a blog post which contended that providing handouts can actually cause harm by incentivizing lack of progress out of poverty and by creating a dependence mentality among recipients According to Zidisha microfinance lending is a better alternative than donations because it incentivizes successful investment of the funds and creates a can-do mentality on the part of recipients \n A philosophical critique of charity can be found in \n Oscar Wilde \n 's \n The Soul of Man \n where he calls it \"a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over the poor's private lives\" as well as a remedy that prolongs the \"disease\" of poverty rather than curing it \n Wilde's thoughts are cited with approval by \n Slavoj iek \n and the Slovenian thinker adds his description of the effect of charity on the charitable \n When confronted with the starving child we are told \"For the price of a couple of cappuccinos you can save her life!\" the true message is \"For the price of a couple of cappuccinos you can continue in your ignorant and pleasurable life not only not feeling any guilt but even feeling good for having participated in the struggle against suffering!\" \n Slavoj iek \n Living in the End Times \n Verso p \n Friedrich Engels \n in his \n treatise \n on the condition of the working class in \n England \n points out that charitable giving whether by governments or individuals is often seen by the givers as a means to conceal suffering that is unpleasant to see Engels quotes from a letter to the editor of an English newspaper who complains that \n streets are haunted by swarms of beggars who try to awaken the pity of the passers-by in a most shameless and annoying manner by exposing their tattered clothing sickly aspect and disgusting wounds and deformities I should think that when one not only pays the poor-rate but also contributes largely to the charitable institutions one had done enough to earn a right to be spared such disagreeable and impertinent molestations \n The English bourgeoisie Engels concludes \n is charitable out of self-interest it gives nothing outright but regards its gifts as a business matter makes a bargain with the poor saying \"If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions I thereby purchase the right not to be troubled any further and you are bound thereby to stay in your dusky holes and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery You shall despair as before but you shall despair unseen this I require this I purchase with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infirmary!\" It is infamous this charity of a Christian bourgeois! \n The \n Institute of Economic Affairs \n published a report in called \"Sock Puppets How the government lobbies itself and why\" which criticised the phenomenon of governments funding charities which then lobby the government for changes which the government wanted all along \n Charity in Christianity \n In medieval Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries Latin \n Christendom \n underwent a charitable revolution \n Rich patrons founded many leprosaria and hospitals for the sick and poor New \n confraternities \n and religious orders emerged with the primary mission of engaging in intensive charitable work Historians debate the causes Some argue that this movement was spurred by economic and material forces as well as a burgeoning urban culture Other scholars argue that developments in spirituality and devotional culture were central For still other scholars medieval charity was primarily a way to elevate one's social status and affirm existing hierarchies of power \n Tzedakah in Judaism \n Sandstone vestige of a Jewish gravestone depicting a \n Tzedakah \n box pushke \n Jewish cemetery \n in \n Otwock \n Karczew-Anielin Poland \n In \n Judaism \n tzedakah \n a \n Hebrew \n term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify \n charity \n refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just \n Because it is commanded by the \n Torah \n and not voluntary the practice is not technically an act of charity such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition Jews give tzedakah which can take the form of money time and resources to the needy out of \"righteousness\" and \"justice\" rather than benevolence generosity or charitableness \n The \n Torah \n requires that percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor \n Zakat and Sadaqa in Islam \n In \n Islam \n there are two methods of charity \n One called \n Zakat \n the other is called \n Sadaqa \n Zakat is one of the \n five pillars \n upon which the Muslim religion is based where 5% of one's saving is compulsory to be given as Zakat per Islamic calendar year provided that the saving is beyond the threshold limit called \n Nisab \n usually determined by the religious authority \n Sadaqa is voluntary charity or contribution Saqada can be given using money personal items time or other resources There is no minimum or maximum requirement for Sadaqa Even smiling to other people is considered a Sadaqa \n Dna in Indian religions \n The practice of charity is called \n Dna \n or \n Daana \n in Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism It is the virtue of generosity or giving \n Dna has been defined in traditional texts state Krishnan and Manoj \n as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return \n Karna \n Mahabali \n and \n Harishchandra \n are heroes also known for giving charity \n The earliest known discussion of charity as a virtuous practice in Indian texts is in \n Rigveda \n According to other ancient texts of Hinduism dna can take the form of feeding or giving to an individual in distress or need \n It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many \n Dna leads to one of the \n perfections \n pramit \n This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity giving and letting go \n Historical records such as those by the Persian

education health housing and even prisons Almshouses were established throughout \n Europe \n in the \n Early Middle Ages \n to provide a place of residence for poor old and distressed people the first recorded almshouse was founded in \n York \n by \n King Athelstan \n in the 10th century \n Enlightenment charity \n The Foundling Hospital The building has been demolished \n It was in the \n Enlightenment era \n that charitable and philanthropic activity among voluntary associations and rich benefactors became a widespread cultural practice Societies \n gentleman's clubs \n and mutual associations began to flourish in \n England \n and the upper-classes increasingly adopted a philanthropic attitude toward the disadvantaged This new social activism was channeled into the establishment of charitable organizations these proliferated from the middle of the century \n This emerging upper-class fashion for benevolence resulted in the incorporation of the first charitable organizations \n Captain \n Thomas Coram \n appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of \n London \n set up the \n Foundling Hospital \n in to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields \n Bloomsbury \n This was the first such charity in the world \n and served as the precedent for incorporated associational charities everywhere \n Jonas Hanway \n another notable philanthropist of the era established \n The Marine Society \n in as the first seafarer's charity in a bid to aid the recruitment of men to the \n navy \n By the Society had recruited over men and it was incorporated by an \n Act of Parliament \n in Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the \n Magdalen Hospital \n to rehabilitate \n prostitutes \n These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held in high social regard - some charities received state recognition in the form of the \n royal charter \n Charities also began to adopt campaigning roles where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that eventually succeeded in ending the \n slave trade \n throughout the \n British Empire \n at the turn of the 19th century and within its considerable sphere of influence The process was however a lengthy one which finally concluded when Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in \n This period also saw growing philosophical debate between those who championed state intervention and those who believed that \n private charities \n should provide welfare \n Thomas Malthus \n the political economist criticized \n poor relief \n for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector \n His views were very influential and informed the \n Victorian \n laissez-faire attitude toward state intervention for the poor \n Growth during 19th century \n During the 19th century a profusion of charitable organizations were set up to alleviate the awful conditions of the \n working class \n in the \n slums \n The \n Labourer's Friend Society \n chaired by \n Lord Shaftesbury \n in the United Kingdom in was set up to improve working class conditions This included the promotion of allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the allotment movement In it became the first \n Model Dwellings Company \n - organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment This was one of the first \n housing associations \n a philanthropic endeavour that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century brought about by the growth of the \n middle class \n Later associations included the \n Peabody Trust \n and the \n Guinness Trust \n The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given the label \"five per cent philanthropy\" \n Andrew Carnegie \n 's philanthropy \n Puck \n magazine cartoon by \n Louis Dalrymple \n There was strong growth in municipal charities The Brougham Commission led on to the \n Municipal Corporations Act \n which reorganized local charities by incorporating them into one entity under supervision from the \n local government \n Charities at the time including the \n Charity Organization Society \n est tended to discriminate between the 'deserving poor' who would be provided with suitable relief and the 'underserving' or 'improvident poor' who were regarded as the cause of their woes through their idleness They also tended to be against the state provision of welfare due to its perceived \n demoralizing effect \n Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period there was still significant government involvement in the shape of statutory regulation and even limited funding \n Philanthropy \n became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America \n Octavia Hill \n and \n John Ruskin \n were an important force behind the development of social housing and \n Andrew Carnegie \n exemplified the large scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America In \n Gospel of Wealth \n Carnegie wrote about the responsibilities of great wealth and the importance of social justice He established \n public libraries \n throughout the English-speaking countries \n as well as contributing large sums to schools and universities \n It was only towards the end of the century with the advent of the \n New Liberalism \n and the innovative work of \n Charles Booth \n on documenting working class life in \n London \n that attitudes towards poverty began to change which led to the first \n social liberal \n welfare reforms \n including \n old age pensions \n and free school meals \n During the 20th century charitable organizations such as \n Oxfam \n est greatly expanded becoming large multinational \n non-governmental organizations \n with very large budgets \n In various countries \n Australia \n This section needs to be \n updated \n Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information \n July \n The definition of charity in Australia is derived through English common law originally from the \n Charitable Uses Act \n and then through several centuries of case law based upon it In the federal government established an inquiry into the definition of a charity The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity based on the principles developed through case law This resulted in the \n Charities Bill \n which included limitations on involvement of charities in political campaigning which many charities saw as an unwelcome departure from the case law The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill As a result of widespread criticism from charities the government abandoned the bill \n The government then introduced what became the \n Extension of Charitable Purpose Act \n which did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose but merely sought to clarify that certain purposes were charitable whose charitable status had been subject to legal doubts These purposes included childcare self-help groups and closed/contemplative religious orders \n To publicly raise funds a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds In Queensland for example charities must register with the Queensland \n Office of Fair Trading \n Also any charity fundraising online must have approval in every Australian jurisdiction that requires them to do so which is currently New South Wales Queensland Victoria Tasmania Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory For example \n Donate Your Day Ltd \n is a purely online New South Wales based charity Many Australian charities have called on federal state and territory governments to enact uniform legislation to enable charities registered in a state or territory to be allowed to raise funds in all other Australian jurisdictions \n The \n Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission \n commenced operations in December and regulates the approximately \n non-profit organisations \n with \n tax exempt \n status and about other NPO in total and seeks to harmonise state-based fund-raising laws \n Canada \n Canadian Charity Law \n Charities in Canada must be registered with the Charities Directorate \n of the Canada Revenue Agency According to the Canada Revenue Agency \n A registered charity is an organization established and operated for charitable purposes and must devote its resources to charitable activities The charity must be resident in Canada and cannot use its income to benefit its members A charity also has to meet a public benefit test To qualify under this test an organization must show that \n its activities and purposes provide a tangible benefit to the public \n those people who are eligible for benefits are either the public as a whole or a significant section of it in that they are not a restricted group or one where members share a private connection such as social clubs or professional associations with specific membership \n the charity's activities must be legal and must not be contrary to public policy \n To register as a charity the organization has to be either incorporated or governed by a legal document called a trust or a constitution This document has to explain the organization's purposes and structure \n Singapore \n The legal situation in \n Singapore \n is regulated in the Singapore Charities Act Chapter \n Charities in Singapore must be registered with the Charities Directorate of the \n Ministry of Community Development Youth and Sports \n One can also find specific organisations in the \n List of voluntary welfare organisations in Singapore \n which are members of the \n National Council of Social Service \n NCSS which is operated by the \n Ministry of Social and Family Development \n United Kingdom \n Charity law within the UK varies among i England and Wales ii Scotland and iii Northern Ireland but the fundamental principles are the same Most organisations that are charities are required to registered with the appropriate regulator for their jurisdiction but significant exceptions apply so that many organisations are \n bona fide \n charities but do not appear on a public register \n citation needed \n The registers are maintained by the \n Charity Commission for England and Wales \n and for Scotland by the \n Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator \n The \n Charity Commission for Northern Ireland \n maintains a register of charities that have completed formal registration see below Organizations applying must meet the specific legal requirements summarized below and have filing requirements with their regulator and are subject to inspection or other forms of review The oldest charity in the UK is \n The King's School Canterbury \n established in \n There is concern that \n legislation addressing lobbying and campaigning \n is preventing charities from speaking for \n poor \n and \n marginalized \n people by subjecting charities to regulation by the \n Electoral Commission \n in the run up to a general election \n England and Wales \n Definition of a charitable organization \n Section Charities Act provides the definition in England and Wales \n For the purposes of the law of England and Wales charity means an institution which \n a is established for charitable purposes only and \n b falls to be subject to the control of the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction with respect to charities \n The \n Charities Act \n provides the following list of charitable purposes \n the prevention or relief of \n poverty \n the advancement of \n education \n the advancement of \n religion \n the advancement of health or the saving of lives \n the advancement of citizenship or community development \n the advancement of the arts culture heritage or science \n the advancement of amateur sport \n the advancement of \n human rights \n conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity \n the advancement of environmental protection or improvement \n the relief of those in need by reason of youth age ill-health disability financial hardship or other disadvantage \n the advancement of animal welfare \n the promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown or of the police fire and rescue services or ambulance services \n other purposes currently recognized as charitable and any new charitable purposes which are similar to another charitable purpose \n A charity must also provide a public benefit \n Before the Charities Act which introduced the definition now contained in the Act the definition of charity arose from a list of charitable purposes in the Charitable Uses Act also known as the Statute of Elizabeth which had been interpreted and expanded into a considerable body of case law In \n Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel \n Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act \n the relief of \n poverty \n the advancement of \n education \n the advancement of \n religion \n and \n other purposes considered beneficial to the community \n Charities in England and Wales - such as Age UK the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \n RSPB \n and the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals \n RSPCA \n must comply with the Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising \n Charitable organization structure \n As of \n update \n there are a number of types of legal structure for a charity in England and Wales \n Unincorporated association \n Trust \n Company limited by guarantee \n Another incorporation such as by royal charter \n Charitable incorporated organization \n The \n unincorporated association \n is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales \n This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose An unincorporated association will normally have as its governing document a constitution or set of rules which will deal with such matters as the appointment of office bearers and the rules governing membership The organization is not though a separate legal entity so it cannot start legal action it cannot borrow money and it cannot enter into contracts in its own name Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts \n A \n trust \n is essentially a relationship among three parties the donor of some assets the trustees who hold the assets and the beneficiaries those people who are eligible to benefit from the charity When the trust has charitable purposes and is a charity the trust is known as a charitable trust The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust which comes into operation once it is signed by all the trustees The main disadvantage of a trust is that as with an unincorporated association it does not have a separate legal entity and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability \n A company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where the liability of members is limited A guarantee company does not have a share capital but instead has members who are guarantors instead of shareholders In the event of the company being wound up the members agree to pay a nominal sum which can be as little as A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where it is desirable for the trustees to have the protection of limited liability Also the charity has legal personality and so can enter into contracts such as employment contracts in its own name \n A small number of charities are incorporated by \n royal charter \n a document which creates a corporation with legal personality or in some instances transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter The charter must be approved by the \n Privy Council \n before receiving royal assent Although the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted generally a royal charter will offer a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts \n The Charities Act legislated for a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities the \n charitable incorporated organization \n with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company Becoming a CIO was only made possible in with staggered introduction dates with the charities with highest turnover eligible first \n The word \n foundation \n is not generally used in England and Wales Occasionally a charity will use the word as part of its name e g \n British Heart Foundation \n but this has no legal significance and does not provide any information about either the work of the charity or how it is legally structured The structure of the organization will be one of the types of structure described above \n Charity registration \n Charitable organizations that have an income of more than and for whom the law of England and Wales applies must register with the \n Charity Commission for England and Wales \n unless they are an \"exempt\" or \"excepted\" charity \n For companies the law of England and Wales will normally apply if the company itself is registered in England and Wales In other cases if the governing document does not make it clear the law which applies will be the country with which the organization is most connected \n When an organization's income does not exceed it is not able to register as a charity with the \n Charity Commission for England and Wales \n It can however register as a charity with \n HM Revenue and Customs \n for tax purposes only With the rise in mandatory registration level to by The Charities Act smaller charities can be reliant upon HMRC recognition to evidence their charitable purpose and confirm their not-for-profit principles \n Some charities which are called \n exempt charities \n are not required to register with the Charity Commission and are not subject to any of the Charity Commission's supervisory powers These charities include most universities and national museums and some other educational institutions Other charities are excepted from the need to register but are still subject to the supervision of the Charity Commission The regulations on excepted charities have however been changed by the Charities Act Many excepted charities are religious charities \n Northern Ireland \n The \n Charity Commission for Northern Ireland \n was established in \n and has received the names and details of over organisations in Northern Ireland that have previously been granted charitable status for tax purposes the \"deemed list\" Compulsory registration of organisations from the deemed list began in December and it is expected to take three to four years to complete \n The new Register of Charities is \n publicly available on the CCNI website \n and contains the details of those organisations who have so far been confirmed by the Commission to exist for charitable purposes and the public benefit The Commission estimates that there are between and charitable organisations to be formally registered in total \n Scotland \n The or so charities in \n Scotland \n are registered with the \n Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator \n OSCR which also publishes a register of charities online \n Taxation of charities \n Charitable organisations including charitable trusts are eligible for a complex set of reliefs and exemptions from taxation in the UK These include reliefs and exemptions in relation to income tax capital gains tax inheritance tax stamp duty land tax and value added tax These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a \n tax avoidance \n technique rather than because they offer a genuine charitable good \n Ireland \n There is no legal framework for the registration of charities in \n Ireland \n The Office of the Revenue Commissioners Charities Section maintains a database of organisations \n to which they have granted charitable tax exemption In granting tax exemption Charities Section gives the body a CHY reference number The full list of bodies granted exemption is published on the Revenue Commissioners website \n The Irish Nonprofits Database was created by Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange INKEx to act as a repository for regulatory and voluntarily disclosed information about Irish public benefit nonprofits The organisation is currently looking for government funding to continue to provide the service \n Ukraine \n Legislation of charitable activity and obtainment of charitable organization status is regulated by Civil code of \n Ukraine \n and by Law of Ukraine Charitable Activities and Charitable Organizations \n By Ukrainian law there are three forms of charitable organization \n charitable society charitable organization created by at least two founders and operates on the basis of the charter or statute \n charitable institution is a kind of charitable trust acts on the basis of the constituent or founding act charitable organization whose founding act defines assets that one or several founders transfer to achieve the goals of charitable activity from such assets and / or income from such assets A constituent act of a charitable institution may be contained in a will or testament The founder or founders of the charitable institution do not participate in the management such charitable organization \n charitable fund or charitable foundation is a charitable organization that operates on the basis of the charter has participants or members and is managed by them participants or members are not obliged to transfer any assets to such organization in order to achieve the goals of charitable activity charitable foundation can be created by one or several founders The assets of charitable fund can be formed by participants and/or other benefactors \n Ministry of justice of Ukraine \n is the main registration authority for charitable organization registration/constitution \n Individuals and legal entities except for public authorities \n local governments \n can be the founders of charitable organizations Charitable societies and charitable foundations may have besides founders other participants who have joined them in the way prescribed by the charters of such charitable associations or charitable foundations \n Alien \n s non Ukrainian citizens and legal entities corporations or non-governmental organizations can be the founders and members of philanthropic organization in Ukraine \n All funds received by a charitable organization that were used for charity purposes are exempt from taxation But it requires obtaining of non-profit status from tax authority \n Legalization needed for International charitable fund to make activity in Ukraine \n United States \n In the \n United States \n a charitable organization is an organization operated for purposes that are beneficial to the \n public interest \n There are different types of charitable organizations Every U S and foreign charity that qualifies as \n tax-exempt \n under Section \n c \n of the \n Internal Revenue Code \n is considered a \" \n private foundation \n \" \n unless \n it demonstrates to the \n IRS \n that it falls into another category Generally any organization that is not a private foundation i e it qualifies as something else is usually a public charity as described in Section a of the Internal Revenue Code \n In addition a private foundation usually derives its principal funding from an individual family corporation or some other single source and is more often than not a \n grantmaker \n and does not solicit funds from the public In contrast a \n foundation \n or public charity generally receives grants from individuals government and private foundations and while some public charities engage in \n grantmaking \n activities most conduct direct service or other tax-exempt activities \n This leads to another distinction Foundations that are generally grantmakers i e they use their \n endowment \n to make grants to other organizations which in turn carry out the goals of the foundation indirectly are usually called \"grantmaker\" or \"non-operating\" foundations These of course tend to be private foundations but some private foundations and most public charities use their received funds to directly engage in service activities themselves and achieve their goals \"personally \" so to speak \n Examples of a non-operating private foundation are the \n Rockefeller Foundation \n and the \n Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \n Examples of operating foundations or public charities include \n Love for the Elderly \n Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation \n American Cancer Society Inc \n Make a Wish Foundation \n the \n World Wildlife Fund \n and the \n Hands for Music Foundation \n The requirements and procedures for forming charitable organizations vary from state to state as do the registration and filing requirements for charitable organizations that conduct charitable activities solicit charitable contributions or hire professional fundraisers \n In practice the detailed definition of \"charitable organization\" is determined by the requirements of state law where the charitable organization operates and the requirements for federal tax relief by the IRS \n Resources exist to provide information even rankings of US charities \n Federal tax relief \n Federal tax law provides tax benefits to nonprofit organizations recognized as exempt from federal income tax under section c of the Internal Revenue Code IRC The benefits of c status include exemption from federal income tax as well as eligibility to receive tax deductible charitable contributions To qualify for c status most organizations must apply to the Internal Revenue Service IRS for such status \n Several requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain c status These include the organization being organized as a corporation trust or unincorporated association and the organizations organizing document such as the articles of incorporation trust documents or articles of association must limit its purposes to being charitable and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local state or federal office and must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual \n Most tax exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports \n IRS Form \n at the state and federal level A tax exempt organization's and some other forms are required to be made available to public scrutiny \n The types of charitable organization that are considered by the IRS to be organized for the public benefit include those that are organized for \n Relief of the poor the distressed or the underprivileged \n Advancement of religion \n Advancement of education or science \n Construction or maintenance of public buildings monuments or works \n Lessening the burdens of government \n Lessening of neighborhood tensions \n Elimination of prejudice and discrimination \n Defense of human and civil rights secured by law \n Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency \n A number of other organizations including those organized for religious scientific literary and educational purposes as well as those for testing for public safety and for fostering national or international amateur sports competition and for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals may also qualify for exempt status \n Charity regulating bodies \n Australian Taxation Office \n Canada Revenue Agency \n Charity Commission for England and Wales \n Charity Commission for Northern Ireland \n Inland Revenue

Criminal law \n Evidence \n v \n t \n e \n Consideration \n is the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into \n contracts \n Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as \"consideration\" for example if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5 A's consideration is the $5 and B's consideration is the car \n Additionally if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500 A's consideration is the service of painting B's house and B's consideration is $500 paid to A Further if A signs a contract with B such that A will \n not \n repaint his own house in any other color than white and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up there is also consideration Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything A did promise \n not \n to do something that he was allowed to do and so A did pass consideration A's consideration to B is the \n forbearance \n in painting his own house in a color other than white and B's consideration to A is $500 per year Conversely if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0 B's consideration is still the car but A is giving no consideration and so there is no valid contract However if B still gives the title to the car to A then B cannot take the car back since while it may not be a valid contract it \n is \n a valid \n gift \n In \n common law \n it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations If there is no element of consideration found there is thus no contract formed \n However even if a court decides there is no contract there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of \n quantum meruit \n sometimes referred to as a \n quasi-contract \n or \n promissory estoppel \n Legal rules regarding consideration \n History and comparative law \n Monetary value of consideration \n Pre-existing legal duties \n Bundled terms \n Past consideration \n Option contracts and conditional consideration \n In settlements \n Treatments by different legal systems \n Legal rules regarding consideration \n There are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract \n Consideration must move from the promisee but need not flow to the promisor \n Consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate \n Consideration cannot be illusory \n Consideration must not be past Past consideration is not good consideration \n Moral consideration is not sufficient \n Performance of existing duties is not good consideration \n Part payment is not good consideration \n History and comparative law \n Systems based on Roman law including Germany \n and Scotland do not require consideration and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that the doctrine of consideration should be abandoned and estoppel used to replace it as a basis for contracts \n However \n legislation \n rather than judicial development has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine \n Lord Justice Denning \n famously stated that \"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind\" \n The reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of \n assumpsit \n which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until when the old forms of action were abolished secondly the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his \n Traite des Obligations \n much read especially after translation into English in by English judges and jurists The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time especially \n John Stuart Mill \n 's influential ideas on free will and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit \n Civil law \n systems take the approach that an exchange of promises or a concurrence of wills alone rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis So if A promises to give B a book and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift However in \n common law systems \n the concept of \n culpa in contrahendo \n a form of \n estoppel \n is increasingly used to create obligations during \n pre-contractual negotiations \n Estoppel is an \n equitable doctrine \n that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an \n assurance \n and the other has relied on the assurance to his \n detriment \n Monetary value of consideration \n Generally courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fairmerely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party \n The dispositive issue is presence of consideration not adequacy of the consideration The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable \n For instance if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion luxury sports car and private jet there is still consideration on both sides A's consideration is $200 and B's consideration is the mansion car and jet Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts and do not intervene The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the \n value of a \n peppercorn \n to the other party As a result contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration typically citing $1 Thus licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration \"for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration \" \n However some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration or consideration with virtually no value Some courts have since thought this was a sham Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals and consequently no contract is formed However this is a minority position \n Pre-existing legal duties \n Pre-existing duty rule \n A party that \n already \n has a legal duty to provide money an object a service or a forbearance does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty \n That legal duty can arise from law or obligation under a previous contract \n The prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his seven-year-old nephew a resident of the US the following offer \"if you do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana until your 18th birthday then I will pay you $500\" On the nephew's 18th birthday he tells the uncle to pay up and the uncle says no In the subsequent lawsuit the uncle wins because the nephew by U S criminal law already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under or marijuana at any age \n The same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted For example A agrees to paint B's house for $500 but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750 If B agrees and A then finishes the job B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount \n An exception to this rule holds for \n settlements \n such as an \n accord and satisfaction \n If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10 and offers to settle it for $5 it is still binding if accepted even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10 \n Pre-existing duties relating to \n at-will employment \n depend largely on state law Generally \n at-will employment \n allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason and allows the employee to resign for any reason There are no duties of continued employment in the future Therefore when an employee demands a raise there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working Similarly when an employer demands a pay-cut there is also no contractual issue with consideration because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker However certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment to enforce terms demanded later by the employer in particular non-competition clauses \n Bundled terms \n Contracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable \n Consider the uncle's situation above If the same uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer \"if you do not smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday then I will pay you $500\" On the nephew's 18th birthday he asks the uncle to pay up and this time in the subsequent lawsuit the nephew may win \n citation needed \n Although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration it was already legally prohibited virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors Even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted there are circumstances where it is legal and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value However the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette even though \n that \n consideration is valueless because it was paired with something of legal value therefore adherence to the entire collective agreement is necessary \n Past consideration \n Generally past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor That is the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages \n An exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise For this to hold three conditions must be satisfied Pao On v Lau Yiu Long \n The act must have been done at the promisors request \n The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit \n Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance \n Option contracts and conditional consideration \n Generally conditional consideration is valid consideration \n Suppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company A says to B \"buy my script \" B says \"How about this I will pay you $5 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now If I do produce your movie in that year then I will give you another $50 and no one else can produce it If I do not produce your movie in that year then you're free to go \" If the two subsequently get into a dispute the issue of whether a contract exists is answered B had an option contracthe could decide to produce the script or not B's consideration passed was the $5 down and the possibility of $50 A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year \n In settlements \n Suppose B commits a \n tort \n against A causing $5 in \n compensatory damages \n and $3 in \n punitive damages \n Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5 compensatory damages This is sufficient consideration since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5 instead of $8 \n Treatments by different legal systems \n Consideration under English law \n Consideration under American law \n Consideration is not required for a contract under \n Scots contract law"},

During the 18th century however \"a more activist and explicitly \n Protestant \n tradition of direct charitable engagement during life\" took hold exemplified by the creation of the \n Society for

Many of the charities were designed to alleviate the harsh living conditions in the slums such as the \n Labourer's Friend Society \n founded in This included the promotion of allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the allotment movement and in it became the first \n Model Dwellings Company \n an organization that sought to improve the housing conditions of

closely tied to the army's Service de Sant By it operated one thousand local committees with members trained nurses and over million francs in assets \n The \n International Committee of the Red Cross \n ICRC played a major role in working with POW's on all sides in World War II It was in a cash starved position when the war began in but quickly mobilized its national offices set up a Central Prisoner of War Agency For example it provided food mail and assistance to British and Commonwealth soldiers and civilians held captive Suspicions especially by London of ICRC as too tolerant or even

history of modern philanthropy the European Continent is especially important in the case of Germany which became a model for others especially regarding the welfare state The princes and in the various Imperial states continued traditional efforts such as monumental buildings parks and art collections Starting in the early 19th century the rapidly emerging middle classes made local philanthropy a major endeavor to establish their legitimate role in shaping society in contradistinction to the aristocracy and the military They concentrated on support for social welfare institutions higher education and cultural institutions as well as some efforts to alleviate the hardships of rapid industrialization The bourgeoisie upper-middle-class was defeated in its effort to it gain political control in but they still had enough money and organizational skill that could be employed through philanthropic agencies to provide an alternative powerbase for their world view \n Religion was a divisive element in Germany as the Protestants Catholics and Jews used alternative philanthropic strategies The Catholics for example continued their medieval practice of using financial donations in their wills to lighten their punishment in \n purgatory \n after death The Protestants did not believe in purgatory but made a strong commitment to the improvement of their communities here and now Conservative Protestants Raised concerns about deviant sexuality alcoholism and socialism as well as illegitimate births They used philanthropy to eradicate social evils that were seen as utterly sinful \n All the religious groups used financial endowments which multiplied in the number and wealth as Germany grew richer Each was devoted to a specific benefit to that religious community Each had a board of trustees these were laymen who donated their time to public service Chancellor Otto von Bismarck an upper class \n Junker \n used his state-sponsored philanthropy in the form of his invention of the modern welfare state to neutralize the political threat posed by the socialistic labor unions \n The middle classes however made the most use of the new welfare state in terms of heavy use of museums gymnasiums high schools universities scholarships and hospitals For example state funding for universities and gymnasiums covered only a fraction of the cost private philanthropy became the essential ingredient 19th century Germany was even more oriented toward civic improvement then Britain or the United States when measured in terms of voluntary private funding for public purposes Indeed such German institutions as the kindergarten the research university and the welfare state became models copied by the Anglo-Saxons \n The heavy human and economic losses of the First World War the financial crises of the 1920s as well as the Nazi regime and other devastation by seriously undermined and weakened the opportunities for widespread philanthropy in Germany The civil society so elaborately build up in the 19th century was practically dead by However by the 1950s as the \"economic miracle\" was restoring German prosperity the old aristocracy was defunct and middle-class philanthropy started to return to importance \n War and postwar Belgium and Eastern Europe \n The \n Commission for Relief in Belgium \n CRB was an international predominantly American organization that arranged for the supply of food to German-occupied Belgium and northern France during the First World War It was led by \n Herbert Hoover \n Between and the CRB operated entirely with voluntary efforts and was able to feed Belgians by raising the necessary money obtaining voluntary contributions of money and food shipping the food to Belgium and controlling its there For example the CRB shipped pounds of flour to Belgium \n Biographer George Nash finds that by the end of Hoover \"stood preeminent in the greatest humanitarian undertaking the world had ever seen \" \n Biographer William Leuchtenburg adds \"He had raised and spent millions of dollars with trifling overhead and not a penny lost to fraud At its peak his organization was feeding nine million Belgians and French a day \n When the war ended in late Hoover took control of the \n American Relief Administration \n ARA with the mission of food to Central and Eastern Europe The ARA fed millions \n U S government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of and Hoover transformed the ARA into a private organization raising millions of dollars from

Christian Democrats and the Socialists to help promote uniform treatment and equal outcomes The success in Italy became a model for Ford programs and many other nations \n The Ford Foundation in the 1950s wanted to modernize the legal systems in India and Africa by promoting the American model The plan failed because of India's unique legal history traditions and profession as well as its

person's or group's culture come to resemble those of another group The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups the latter case can refer to either foreign \n immigrants \n or native residents that come to be culturally dominated by another societal group \n Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on circumstances of the group Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group \n Whether it is desirable for a given group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social homophily though as this article states geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different \n Overview \n Assimilation by country \n United States \n Notes \n Overview \n A place a state or an ethnicity can spontaneously adopt a different culture due to its political relevance or to its perceived cultural superiority The first is the case of the \n Latin language \n and culture that were gradually adopted by most of the subjugated people \n Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture or older and richer cultures forcibly integrate other weak cultures \n The term assimilation is often used not only with regard to indigenous groups who find themselves in the minority before another culture perceived as more sophisticated or prestigious but also immigrants and various ethnic groups who have settled in a new land A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication \n Cultural changing \n is not simply a one-way process Assimilation assumes that relatively tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture This process happens through contact and accommodation between each culture The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants but in \n multiculturalism \n cultural assimilation can happen all over the world not just be limited to specific areas For example a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally not just being limited to the same cultural group People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the \"global culture\" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries This \"global culture\" can be seen as a part of assimilation that causes cultures from different areas to affect each other \n Assimilation by country \n Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country but also lose aspects perhaps all of their heritage too Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation \n socioeconomic status \n geographic distribution \n second language \n attainment and \n intermarriage \n William A V Clark defines immigrant assimilation as \"a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and \n minority groups \n \" \n United States \n Further information \n Americanization immigration \n Between and the United States took in roughly million immigrants \n This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes The beginning of the twenty-first century has also marked a massive era of immigration and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impact that immigration has on society and the impact it has on immigrants themselves \n Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology \n Henry Pratt Fairchild \n associates American assimilation with Americanization or the \n melting pot \n theory Some scholars also believed assimilation and acculturation were synonymous According to a many's point of view assimilation is a \"process of interpretation and fusion\" from another group or person This may include memories behaviors and sentiments By sharing their experiences and histories they blend into the common cultural life \n The long history of immigration in these established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of \n class \n racial \n and \n ethnic \n hierarchies in these traditional gateways are more structured or established on the other hand these new gateways do not have much immigration \n history \n therefore the place of immigrants in terms of class racial and ethnic hierarchies is less defined and immigrants may have more influence to define their position Secondly the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of \n segregation \n among immigrants and native-born people Thirdly the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation Traditional gateways unlike new gateways have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid bureaus social organizations Finally Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that these differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers should assess immigrant assimilation \n Acculturation \n Conformity \n Cultural imperialism \n Cultural

\n is derived from the \n Ancient Greek \n word \n empatheia \n meaning \"physical affection or passion\" This in turn comes from \n en \n \"in at\" and \n pathos \n \"passion\" or \"suffering\" \n The term was adapted by \n Hermann Lotze \n and \n Robert Vischer \n to create the German word \n Einfhlung \n \"feeling into\" which was translated by \n Edward B Titchener \n into the English term empathy \n Alexithymia \n is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding processing or describing emotions \n in oneself \n as opposed to in others \n This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words \n alekso \n meaning \"push away repel or protect\" and \n thymos \n meaning \"the soul as the seat of emotion feeling and thought\" Thus alexithymia literally means \"pushing away your emotions\" \n Definitions \n Empathy has many definitions that encompass a broad range of emotional states including caring for other people and having a desire to help them experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions discerning what another person is thinking or feeling \n and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other \n It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another blur \n It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person \n Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response Broken homes childhood trauma lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future \n Martin Hoffman \n is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy \n Compassion \n and \n sympathy \n are terms associated with empathy Definitions vary contributing to the challenge of defining empathy Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need which motivates us to help them Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need Some include in sympathy an \n empathic concern \n a feeling of concern for another in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier \n Empathy is distinct also from \n pity \n and \n emotional contagion \n Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves often described as \"feeling sorry\" for someone Emotional contagion is when a person especially an infant or a member of a \n mob \n imitatively \"catches\" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening \n Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized If for example emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy On the other hand if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process However the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate \n and may be achieved unconsciously Yet it can be trained \n and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy \n Empathy necessarily has a \"more or less\" quality The paradigm case of an empathic interaction however involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions associated emotional states and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy \n The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the \n proprioceptive \n feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself \n Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling \n In the field of positive psychology empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain Sometimes when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person acts of altruism occur However many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains According to positive psychologists people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be \n altruistic \n Gender differences \n The literature commonly indicates that females tend to be more empathic than males On average female subjects score higher than males on the \n Empathy Quotient \n EQ while males tend to score higher on the \n Systemizing Quotient \n SQ Both males and females with \n autistic spectrum disorders \n usually score lower on the EQ and SQ \n see below \n for more detail on autism and empathy \n However a series of studies using a variety of neurophysiological measures including \n MEG \n spinal reflex excitability \n electroencephalography \n and N400 paradigm \n have documented the presence of an overall gender difference in the human mirror neuron system with female participants tending to exhibit stronger motor resonance than male participants In addition these aforementioned studies found that female participants tended to score higher on empathy self-report dispositional measures and that these measures positively correlated with the physiological response Other studies show no significant difference and instead suggest that gender differences are the result of motivational differences \n A review published in the journal \n Neuropsychologia \n found that women tended to be better at recognizing facial effects expression processing and emotions in general \n Men only tended to be better at recognizing specific behavior which includes anger aggression and threatening cues \n A meta-analysis by researcher Rena A Kirkland in the journal \n North American Journal of Psychology \n found significant sex differences favoring females in \"Reading of the mind\" test \"Reading of the mind\" test is an advanced ability measure of cognitive empathy in which Kirkland's analysis involved studies across countries \n Another meta-analysis in the journal of \n Cognition and Emotion \n found overall female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition across samples \n Using \n fMRI \n neuroscientist \n Tania Singer \n showed that empathy-related neural responses tended to be significantly lower in males when observing an \"unfair\" person experiencing pain \n An analysis from the journal of \n Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews \n also found that overall there are sex differences in empathy from birth growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan \n Females on average were found to have higher empathy than males while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development \n Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males \n Another investigation with similar brain tools such as \n N400 \n amplitudes found on average higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy \n Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger \n grey matter \n volumes in posterior \n inferior frontal \n and anterior \n inferior parietal cortex \n areas which are correlated with \n mirror neurons \n in \n fMRI \n literature \n Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy \n The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance \n Throughout prehistory females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions According to the \n Primary Caretaker Hypothesis \n prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy \n Major theories and empirical findings \n Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims Researchers found that cognitive empathy rather than emotional empathy predicted helping behavior towards victims \n Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others cognitive empathy allows these individuals to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort whereas sharing the emotions of the victims emotional empathy can cause emotional distress helplessness victim-blaming and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping \n Yet despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation egoistic explanations may still be possible For example one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight Consequently the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition which is what occurred An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping If this is the case then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation Consequently relative strengths of different emotional reactions systematically related to the need situation may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation Dovidio But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement Thus an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground \n Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities \n science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains Dr Christian Keysers \n citation needed \n Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context much like sympathy Unlike personal distress empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response Additionally empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy or empathetic concern and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action \n Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress \n In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists \n In this sense arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions For social beings negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape \n Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange Additionally recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state \n Thus empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others \n Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners \n Although there is general agreement that empathy is essential in educational settings research has found that it is difficult to develop empathy in trainee teachers \n According to one theory there are seven components involved in the effectiveness of intercultural communication empathy was found to be one of the seven This theory also states that empathy is learnable However research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status culture religion language skin colour gender age and so on \n In order to achieve intercultural empathy psychologists have employed empathy training One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group \n The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group To test this the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory and questionnaires Using these measures the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy Also communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training While there didnt seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training the study did report that \"relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication\" \n The environment has been another interesting topic of study Many theorize that environmental factors such as parenting style and relationships play a significant role in the development of empathy in children Empathy promotes pro social relationships helps mediate aggression and allows us to relate to others all of which make empathy an important emotion among children \n A study done by Caroline Tisot looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children Parenting style parent empathy and prior social experiences were looked at The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire which assesses parenting style and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale \n This study found that a few parenting practices as opposed to parenting style as a whole contributed to the development of empathy in children These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important and was positively related to empathy within children especially in boys Interestingly however maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children especially in girls \n It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain \n In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual \n People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies In fact more than 50% of people who suffer from a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity \n Again linking this back to the early developmental stages of emotion if emotional growth has been stunted at an early age due to various factors empathy will struggle to infest itself in that individuals mind-set as a natural feeling as they themselves will struggle to come to terms with their own thoughts and emotions This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding your own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individuals emotional state \n Applications \n The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals thus inducing a type of bias Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt \n On a more positive note aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping modeling and internalized guilt Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations especially in the long-term At a societal level experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups even used to improve racial attitudes actions toward people with AIDS the homeless and even convicts Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations \n Types \n Affective and cognitive \n Empathy is generally divided into two major components \n Affective empathy \n also called \n emotional empathy \n the capacity to respond with an appropriate emotion to another's mental states \n Our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion \n being affected by another's emotional or arousal state \n Cognitive empathy \n the capacity to understand another's perspective or mental state \n The terms \n cognitive empathy \n and \n theory of mind \n or \n mentalizing \n are often used synonymously but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy it is unclear whether these are equivalent \n Although science has not yet agreed upon a precise definition of these constructs there is consensus about this distinction \n Affective and cognitive empathy are also independent from one another someone who strongly empathizes emotionally is not necessarily good in understanding another's perspective \n Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales \n Empathic concern \n sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering \n Personal distress \n self-centered feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another's suffering \n There is no consensus regarding whether personal distress is a basic form of empathy or instead does not constitute empathy \n There may be a developmental aspect to this subdivision Infants respond to the distress of others by getting distressed themselves only when they are years old do they start to respond in other-oriented ways trying to help comfort and share \n Cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales \n Perspective-taking \n the tendency to spontaneously adopt others' psychological perspectives \n Fantasy \n the tendency to identify with fictional characters \n Tactical or \"strategic\" empathy \n the deliberate use of perspective-taking to achieve certain desired ends \n Distribution \n A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions \n Psychopathy \n and \n narcissism \n have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy whereas \n bipolar disorder \n and \n borderline traits \n have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy \n Autism spectrum disorders \n have been associated with various combinations including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy \n Schizophrenia \n too has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy \n However even in people without conditions such as these the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies \n A meta-analysis of recent fMRI studies of empathy confirmed that different brain areas are activated during affectiveperceptual empathy and cognitiveevaluative empathy \n Also a study with patients with different types of brain damage confirmed the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy \n Specifically the \n inferior frontal gyrus \n appears to be responsible for emotional empathy and the \n ventromedial prefrontal gyrus \n seems to mediate cognitive empathy \n The Interpersonal Reactivity Index IRI is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy It comprises a self-report questionnaire of items divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy \n Somatic \n Somatic empathy \n is a physical reaction probably based on \n mirror neuron \n responses in the somatic nervous system \n Development \n By the age of two years children normally begin to display the fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state \n Even earlier at one year of age infants have some rudiments of empathy in the sense that they understand that just like their own actions other people's actions have goals \n Sometimes \n toddlers \n will comfort others or show concern for them at as early an age as two Also during the second year toddlers will play games of falsehood or \"pretend\" in an effort to fool others and this requires that the child know what others believe before he or she can manipulate those beliefs \n In order to develop these traits it is essential to expose your child to face-to-face interactions and opportunities and lead them away from a \n sedentary lifestyle \n According to researchers at the \n University of Chicago \n who used \n functional magnetic resonance imaging \n fMRI children between the ages of and years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain Their findings \n are consistent with previous fMRI studies of \n pain empathy \n with adults The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual including regions involved in moral reasoning \n Despite being able to show some signs of empathy including attempting to comfort a crying baby from as early as months to two years most children do not show a fully fledged \n theory of mind \n until around the age of four \n Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy \n Children usually become capable of passing \"false belief\" tasks considered to be a test for a theory of mind around the age of four Individuals with \n autism \n often find using a theory of mind very difficult e g Baron-Cohen Leslie & Frith the \n Sally-Anne test \n Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients The theory first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics \n Individual differences \n Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation But how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs In essence not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances The Empathic Concern scale assesses \"other-oriented\" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures \"self-oriented\" feelings of personal anxiety and unease The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition \n Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction \n Genetics \n Research suggests that empathy is also partly genetically determined \n For instance carriers of the deletion variant of \n ADRA2B \n show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images \n The gene \n 5-HTTLPR \n seems to determine sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of ADRA2b \n Carriers of the double G variant of the \n OXTR \n gene were found to have better social skills and higher self-esteem \n A gene located near LRRN1 on chromosome then again controls the human ability to read understand and respond to emotions in others \n Neurological basis \n Research in recent years has focused on possible brain processes underlying the experience of empathy For instance \n functional magnetic resonance imaging \n fMRI has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy \n These studies have shown that observing another person's emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network involved in processing that same state in oneself whether it is disgust \n touch \n or pain \n The study of the neural underpinnings of empathy has received increased interest following the target paper published by Preston and \n Frans de Waal \n following the discovery of \n mirror neurons \n in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an action as well as when they themselves perform it \n In their paper they argue that attended perception of the object's state automatically activates neural representations and that this activation automatically primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses idea of perception-action-coupling \n unless inhibited This mechanism is similar to the \n common coding theory \n between perception and action Another recent study provides evidence of separate neural pathways activating reciprocal suppression in different regions of the brain associated with the performance of \"social\" and \"mechanical\" tasks These findings suggest that the \n cognition \n associated with reasoning about the \"state of another person's mind\" and \"causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects\" are neurally suppressed from occurring at the same time \n A recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies found that affective empathy is correlated with increased activity in the \n insula \n while cognitive empathy is correlated with activity in the mid \n cingulate cortex \n and adjacent dorsomedial \n prefrontal cortex \n It has been suggested that mirroring-behavior in motor neurons during empathy may help duplicate feelings \n Such sympathetic action may afford access to sympathetic feelings for another and perhaps trigger emotions of kindness forgiveness \n Empathic anger and distress \n Anger \n Empathic anger is an \n emotion \n a form of empathic distress \n Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing It is possible to see this form of anger as a \n pro-social \n emotion \n citation needed \n Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories trait empathic anger and state empathic anger \n The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability the less angry they were in response to a provocation Empathic concern did not however significantly predict anger response and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger \n Distress \n Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger feelings of injustice or \n guilt \n These emotions can be perceived as pro-social and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior \n Atypical response \n Atypical empathic responses have been associated with \n autism \n and particular \n personality disorders \n such as \n psychopathy \n borderline \n narcissistic \n and \n schizoid \n personality disorders \n conduct disorder \n schizophrenia \n bipolar disorder \n and \n depersonalization \n Lack of empathy has also been associated with sex offenders It was found that offenders that had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured the same type of abuse felt less empathy for their victims \n Autism \n The interaction between empathy and \n autism \n is a complex and ongoing field of research Several different factors are proposed to be at play \n A study of \n high-functioning \n adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of \n alexithymia \n a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others \n Based on fMRI studies alexithymia is responsible for a lack of empathy \n The lack of empathic attunement inherent to alexithymic states may reduce quality \n and satisfaction \n of relationships Recently a study has shown that high-functioning autistic adults appear to have a range of responses to music similar to that of neurotypical individuals including the deliberate use of music for mood management Clinical treatment of alexithymia could involve using a simple associative learning process between musically induced emotions and their cognitive correlates \n A study has suggested that the empathy deficits associated with the autism spectrum may be due to significant comorbidity between alexithymia and autism spectrum conditions rather than a result of social impairment \n One study found that relative to typically developing children high-functioning autistic children showed reduced \n mirror neuron \n activity in the brain's \n inferior frontal gyrus \n pars opercularis while imitating and observing emotional expressions \n EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism including impaired theory of mind and empathy \n The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy \n Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired \n theory of mind \n Theory of mind is the ability to understand the perspectives of others \n The terms cognitive empathy and \n theory of mind \n are often used synonymously but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy it is unclear whether these are equivalent \n Theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex and empathy i e the ability to share the feelings of others relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures \n citation needed \n The lack of clear distinctions between \n theory of mind \n and empathy may have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with Asperger syndrome many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind \n Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls which may be a result of high \n egocentrism \n found in autistic individuals \n The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy \n Professor \n Simon Baron-Cohen \n suggests that those with classic \n autism \n often lack both cognitive and affective empathy \n However other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints \n Research also suggests that people with \n Asperger syndrome \n may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as and higher personal distress than controls \n The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy \n although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism emotional empathy depends on \n mirror neuron \n activity which as described previously has been found to be reduced in those with autism and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced \n The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others emotions These disorders of empathy further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by illustrating some of the consequences to disrupted empathy development \n The \n empathizingsystemizing theory \n E-S suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions empathizing E and systemizing S These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient EQ and Systemizing Quotient SQ Five different \"brain types\" can be observed among the population based on the scores which should correlate with differences at the neural level In the E-S theory autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an \"Extreme Type S\" brain type corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy \n It has been shown that males are generally less empathetic than females \n The Extreme Male Brain EMB theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain specifically people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile A study showed that some aspects of autistic neuroanatomy seem to be extremes of typical male neuroanatomy which may be influenced by elevated levels of \n fetal testosterone \n rather than gender itself \n Another study involving brain scans of men and women suggested that autism affects male and female brains differently females with autism had brains that appeared to be closer to those of non-autistic males than females yet the same kind of difference was not observed in males with autism \n Psychopathy \n Psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of \n remorse \n and empathy \n The \n Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n DSM and \n International Classification of Diseases \n ICD list \n antisocial personality disorder \n ASPD and \n dissocial personality disorder \n stating that these have been referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy \n A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues e g facial and vocal expressions of fear and \n sadness \n including decreased activation of the \n fusiform \n and \n extrastriate cortical \n regions which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear and impairments of empathy \n Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations \n The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths although less responsive than those of controls \n The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear Some recent fMRI studies have reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions positives and negatives \n A recent study on psychopaths found that under certain circumstances they could willfully empathize with others and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will which would enable them to be both callous and charming The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their \"empathy switch\" Others suggested that despite the results of the study it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic \n Work conducted by Professor \n Jean Decety \n with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights In one study psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the \n ventromedial prefrontal cortex \n amygdala \n and \n periaqueductal gray \n parts of the brain but more activity in the \n striatum \n and the \n insula \n when compared to control participants \n In a second study individuals with psychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain-affective brain regions when taking an imagine-self perspective but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine-other perspectivein particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdalawhich may contribute to their lack of empathic concern \n It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy are correspond strongly The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions Therefore individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others \n Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain professor \n Simon Baron-Cohen \n claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors social cues and what others are feeling Psychopathy is however associated with impairment in the other major component of empathyaffective emotional empathywhich includes the ability to \n feel \n the suffering and emotions of others what scientists would term as \n emotional contagion \n and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders \n Those with \n autism \n on the other hand are often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy \n Other conditions \n Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions \n Borderline personality disorder \n is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction \n Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react \n While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states impaired \n cognitive empathy \n as well as an impaired \n theory of mind \n People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces suggesting increased empathic capacities \n It is therefore possible that impaired cognitive empathy the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction while \"hyper-emotional empathy\" \n verification needed \n may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals \n One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy \n One diagnostic criterion of \n narcissistic personality disorder \n is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others \n Characteristics of \n schizoid personality disorder \n include emotional coldness detachment and impaired \n affect \n corresponding with an inability to be empathetic and sensitive towards others \n A study conducted by \n Jean Decety \n and colleagues at the \n University of Chicago \n demonstrated that subjects with aggressive \n conduct disorder \n elicit atypical empathic responses to viewing others in pain \n Subjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as \n controls \n to the pain of others but unlike controls subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the \n amygdala \n and \n ventral striatum \n areas that enable a general arousing effect of \n reward \n yet impaired activation of the \n neural \n regions involved in self-regulation and \n metacognition \n including \n moral reasoning \n in addition to diminished processing between the amygdala and the \n prefrontal cortex \n Schizophrenia \n is characterized by impaired affective empathy \n as well as severe cognitive and empathy impairments as measured by the Empathy Quotient EQ \n These empathy impairments are also associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks \n Bipolar \n individuals have been observed to have impaired cognitive empathy and theory of mind but increased affective empathy \n Despite cognitive flexibility being impaired planning behavior is intact It has been suggested that dysfunctions in the \n prefrontal

empathic understanding \n Research regarding whether similar past experience makes the empathizer more accurate is mixed \n Ethical issues \n The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party \n The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances For instance \n Tania Singer \n says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others to not over-invest their own emotions for the other at the risk of \n draining away \n their own resourcefulness \n Furthermore an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a \n caregiving \n situation \n Disciplinary approaches \n Philosophy \n Ethics \n In his book \n How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong \n writer \n Iain King \n presents two reasons why empathy is the \"essence\" or \"DNA\" of right and wrong First he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint \n including that it is \"partly self-standing\" and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside as moral motivations seem to be \n This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as \"moral\" His second argument is more practical he argues \"Empathy for others really is the route to value in life\" and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one \n By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics King is able to reconcile ethics based on \n consequences \n with \n virtue-ethics \n and \n act-based \n accounts of right and wrong \n His empathy-based system has been taken up by some \n Buddhists \n and is used to address some practical problems such as when to tell \n lies \n and how to develop culturally-neutral \n rules for romance \n In the book \n The Ethics of Care and Empathy \n philosopher \n Michael Slote \n introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy His claim is that moral motivation does and should stem from a basis of empathic response He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural These natural obligations include a greater empathic and moral obligation to family and friends along with an account of temporal and physical distance In situations of close temporal and physical distance and with family or friends our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent \n Phenomenology \n In \n phenomenology \n empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint without confusion between self and \n other \n This draws on the \n sense of agency \n In the most basic sense this is the experience of the other's body and in this sense it is an experience of \"my body over there\" In most other respects however the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience in experiencing empathy what is experienced is not \"my\" experience even though \n I \n experience it Empathy is also considered to be the condition of \n intersubjectivity \n and as such the source of the constitution of objectivity \n Some postmodern historians such as \n Keith Jenkins \n in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant \n liberal \n discourse of modern society and can be connected to \n John Stuart Mill \n 's concept of reciprocal freedom Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the \n epistemological \n conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize \n It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future \n citation needed \n A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present If we watch from a fictitious past can tell the present with the future tense as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past \n Evolution \n An increasing number of studies in \n animal behavior \n and \n neuroscience \n claim that empathy is not restricted to humans and is in fact as old as the mammals or perhaps older Examples include \n dolphins \n saving humans from drowning or from \n shark attacks \n Professor Tom White suggests that reports of \n cetaceans \n having three times as many spindle cells the nerve cells that convey empathy in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings \n A multitude of behaviors has been observed in \n primates \n both in captivity and in the wild and in particular in \n bonobos \n which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates \n A recent study has demonstrated \n prosocial behavior \n elicited by empathy in rodents \n Rodents have been shown to demonstrate empathy for cagemates but not strangers in pain \n One of the most widely read studies on the evolution of empathy which discusses a neural perception-action mechanism PAM is the one by Stephanie Preston and de Waal \n This review postulates a bottom-up model of empathy that ties together all levels from state matching to perspective-taking For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety empathy is not specific to humans He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary biochemical and neurological underpinnings and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication social \n attachment \n and \n parental care \n Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the \n brainstem \n the \n amygdala \n hypothalamus \n basal ganglia \n insula \n and \n orbitofrontal cortex \n Context evolution problems \n Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness Since the first \n mammals \n lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other as shown by most mammals failing at \n mirror tests \n the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended However there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care However such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species \n Psychotherapy \n Heinz Kohut \n is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure for instance when you must reckon with another principle that of reality \n In evolutionary psychology attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish the \"ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them\" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's \n empathy-altruism \n hypothesis If empathy is not felt social exchange what's in it for me? supersedes pure altruism but if empathy is felt an individual will help by actions or by word regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards \n Education \n An important target of the method \n Learning by teaching \n LbT is to train systematically and in each lesson teach empathy Students have to transmit new content to their classmates so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking Carl R Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have Other research and publications by Tausch Aspy Roebuck Lyon and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits \n Business and management \n In the book \n Wired to Care \n strategy consultant Dev Patnaik argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations He states that lacking any sense of empathy people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st Century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers pointing to Nike Harley-Davidson and IBM as examples of \"Open Empathy Organizations\" Such institutions he claims see new opportunities more quickly than competitors adapt to change more easily and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs \n In the book \n The Empathy Factor \n organizational consultant Marie Miyashiro similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace and offers \n Nonviolent Communication \n as an effective mechanism for achieving this \n In studies by the Management Research Group empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of competencies in its management model and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness \n Measurement \n This section \n has an unclear citation style \n The references used may be made clearer with a different or consistent style of \n citation \n and \n footnoting \n July \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure UOM should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate \n Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives \n Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax 1967b \n Other experimenters including Mehrabian and Epstein \n have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors or those of other people involved in the experiment as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters \n Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced e g Levenson and Ruef \n Leslie et al \n Bodily or \"somatic\" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of \"emotional contagion\" or mirroring e g Levenson and Ruef 1992* Leslie et al 2004* It should be pointed out that these reactions whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer could also if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through cognitions associated with role-taking \"if I were him I would feel \" \n Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding In some experiments subjects are required to watch video scenarios either staged or authentic and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy e g Geher Warner and Brown \n scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form e g Mehrabian and Epstein \n Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates e g Davis \n More recent paper-based tools include The \n Empathy Quotient \n EQ created by \n Baron-Cohen \n and Wheelwright \n which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of items \n For the very young picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers e g Denham and Couchoud Dependent variables variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions Barnett \n A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy These may be rooted in another problem deciding what empathy is and what it is not In general researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait As a result they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not In most cases instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy Geher et al * Gladstein \n summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon \"empathy\" a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill \n In the field of medicine a measurement tool for carers is the \n Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy Health Professional Version JSPE-HP \n The Interpersonal Reactivity Index IRI is the only published measurement tool accounting for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy consisting of a self-report questionnaire of items divided into four 7-item scales covering the subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy \n Other animals \n Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species including but not limited to canines felines dolphins primates rats and mice \n citation needed \n In animals empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival the sharing of food companionship and pack-oriented mentality It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response Many researchers \n who? \n maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of \n anthropomorphism \n Researchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal studied the socio-emotional development of the \n bonobo \n chimpanzee \n They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events related to themselves loss of a fight and of stressful events of others It was found that the bonobos sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development such as empathic-like behaviors \n Empathic-like responding has been observed in \n chimpanzees \n in various different aspects of their natural behaviors For example chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings a behavior recognized as consolation Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups \n The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees This behavior is found in humans and particularly in human infants Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed as with humans chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees \n It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants Researcher Hollis studied the \n Cataglyphis cursor \n sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand \n The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging limb pulling transporting sand away from the trapped ant and when efforts remained unfruitful began to attack the nylon thread itself biting and pulling apart the threads Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants but only \n Cataglyphis floricola \n and \n Lasius grandis \n species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms \n Canines \n have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger \n When the participants were talking or humming the dog showed no behavioral changes however when the participants were pretending to cry the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion by sniffing licking and nuzzling the distressed person The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement tail wagging or panting Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior \n When witnessing chicks in distress domesticated hens \n Gallus gallus domesticus \n show emotional and physiological responding Researchers Edgar Paul and Nicol \n found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger the mother hens heart rate increased vocal alarms were sounded personal preening decreased and body temperature increased This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy however it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality \n Artificial empathy \n Attribution psychology \n

meaning \"equivalent \n retaliation \n \" It is also a highly effective \n strategy \n in \n game theory \n for the \n iterated prisoner's dilemma \n The strategy was first introduced by \n Anatol Rapoport \n in \n Robert Axelrod \n 's two tournaments \n held around Notably it was on both occasions both the \n simplest \n strategy and the most successful in direct competition \n An \n agent \n using this strategy will first cooperate then subsequently replicate an opponent's previous action If the opponent previously was cooperative the agent is cooperative If not the agent is not This is similar to \n superrationality \n and \n reciprocal altruism \n in \n biology \n Implications \n Problems \n Tit for two tats \n Real world use \n Peer-to-peer file sharing \n Explaining reciprocal altruism in animal communities \n War \n Implications \n The success of the tit-for-tat strategy which is largely cooperative despite that its name emphasizes an adversarial nature took many by surprise Arrayed against strategies produced by various teams it won in two competitions After the first competition new strategies formulated specifically to combat tit-for-tat failed due to their negative interactions with each other a successful strategy other than tit-for-tat would have had to be formulated with both tit-for-tat and itself in mind \n This result may give insight into how groups of animals and particularly human societies have come to live in largely or entirely cooperative societies rather than the individualistic \" \n red in tooth and claw \n \" way that might be expected from individuals engaged in a \n Hobbesian \n state of nature This and particularly its application to human society and politics is the subject of \n Robert Axelrod \n 's book \n The Evolution of Cooperation \n Moreover the tit-for-tat strategy has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict Research has indicated that when individuals who have been in competition for a period of time no longer trust one another the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members Therefore if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation then cooperation ensues On the other hand if the other party competes then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well Ultimately each action by the other member is countered with a matching response competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation \n In the case of conflict resolution the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons the technique is recognized as \n clear \n nice \n provocable \n and \n forgiving \n Firstly It is a \n clear \n and recognizable strategy Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly Moreover it is considered to be \n nice \n as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move The strategy is also \n provocable \n because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete Finally it is \n forgiving \n as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move \n The implications of the tit-for-tat strategy have been of relevance to conflict research resolution and many aspects of applied social science \n Problems \n While Axelrod has empirically shown that the strategy is optimal in some cases of direct competition two agents playing tit for tat remain vulnerable A one-time single-bit error in either player's interpretation of events can lead to an unending \"death spiral\" if one agent defects and the opponent cooperates then both agents will end up alternating cooperate and defect yielding a lower payoff than if both agents were to continually cooperate This situation frequently arises in real world conflicts ranging from schoolyard fights to civil and regional wars The reason for these issues is that tit for tat is not a \n subgame perfect equilibrium \n except under knife-edge conditions on the \n discount rate \n While this subgame is not directly reachable by two agents playing tit for tat strategies a strategy must be a \n Nash equilibrium \n in all subgames to be subgame perfect Further this subgame may be reached if any noise is allowed in the agents' signaling A subgame perfect variant of tit for tat known as \"contrite tit for tat\" may be created by employing a basic reputation mechanism \n Tit for two tats could be used to mitigate this problem see the description below \n \"Tit for tat with forgiveness\" is a similar attempt to escape the death spiral When the opponent defects a player employing this strategy will occasionally cooperate on the next move anyway The exact probability that a player will respond with cooperation depends on the line-up of opponents \n Furthermore the tit-for-tat strategy is not proved optimal in situations short of total competition For example when the parties are friends it may be best for the friendship when a player cooperates at every step despite occasional deviations by the other player Most situations in the real world are less competitive than the total competition in which the tit-for-tat strategy won its competition \n Tit for two tats \n Tit for two tats \n is similar to tit for tat in that it is nice retaliating forgiving and non-envious \n clarification needed \n the only difference between the two being how forgiving the strategy is \n In a tit for tat strategy once an opponent defects the tit for tat player immediately responds by defecting on the next move This has the unfortunate consequence of causing two retaliatory strategies to continuously defect against each other resulting in a poor outcome for both players A tit for two tats player will let the first defection go unchallenged as a means to avoid the \"death spiral\" of the previous example If the opponent defects twice in a row the tit for two tats player will respond by defecting \n This strategy was put forward by \n Robert Axelrod \n during his second round of computer simulations at \n RAND \n After analyzing the results of the first experiment he determined that had a participant entered the tit for two tats strategy it would have emerged with a higher cumulative score than any other program As a result he himself entered it with high expectations in the second tournament Unfortunately owing to the more aggressive nature of the programs entered in the second round which were able to take advantage of its highly forgiving nature tit for two tats did significantly worse in the game-theory sense than tit for tat \n Real world use \n Peer-to-peer file sharing \n BitTorrent protocol Downloading torrents and sharing files \n BitTorrent \n peers use tit-for-tat strategy to optimize their download speed \n More specifically most BitTorrent peers use a variant of Tit for two Tats which is called \n regular unchoking \n in BitTorrent terminology BitTorrent peers have a limited number of upload slots to allocate to other peers Consequently when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated it will use a tit-for-tat strategy Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth Therefore when a peer is not uploading in return to our own peer uploading the BitTorrent program will \n choke \n the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer \n Regular unchoking \n corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoners dilemma Periodically a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer \n unchoke \n This is called \n optimistic unchoking \n This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research \n Explaining reciprocal altruism in animal communities \n Studies in the prosocial behaviour of animals have led many ethologists and evolutionary psychologists to apply tit-for-tat strategies to explain why altruism evolves in many animal communities Evolutionary game theory derived from the mathematical theories formalised by \n von Neumann \n and \n Morgenstern \n was first devised by \n Maynard Smith \n and explored further in bird behaviour by \n Robert Hinde \n Their application of game theory to the evolution of animal strategies launched an entirely new way of analysing animal behaviour \n Reciprocal altruism \n works in animal communities where the cost to the benefactor in any transaction of food mating rights nesting or territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary The theory also holds that the act of altruism should be reciprocated if the balance of needs reverse Mechanisms to identify and punish \"cheaters\" who fail to reciprocate in effect a form of tit for tat are important to regulate reciprocal altruism For example tit-for-tat is suggested to be the mechanism of cooperative predator inspection behavior in \n guppies \n War \n The tit-for-tat inability of either side to back away from conflict for fear of being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy has been the source of many conflicts throughout history \n However the tit for tat strategy has also been detected by analysts in the spontaneous \n non-violent \n behaviour called \" \n live and let live \n \" that arose during trench warfare in the \n First World War \n Troops dug in only a few hundred feet from each other would evolve an unspoken understanding If a sniper killed a soldier on one side the other could expect an equal retaliation Conversely if no one was killed for a time the other side would acknowledge this implied \"truce\" and act accordingly This created a \"separate peace\" between the trenches \n Eye for an eye \n Attitude polarization \n Chicken game \n Christmas truce \n

a cynical view of humanity and a need for power and toughness resulting from the anxieties produced by perceived lapses in society's conventional norms destructiveness and cynicism Other characteristics of this personality type are a general tendency to focus upon those who violate conventional values and act harshly towards them authoritarian aggression a general opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies anti-intraception a tendency to believe in mystic determination superstition and finally an exaggerated concern with promiscuity \n In regards to child development the formation of the authoritarian type occurs within the first few years of the person's life strongly shaped by the parents and family structure \"Hierarchical authoritarian exploitative\" parent-child relationships may result in this personality type Adorno et al pp Parents who have a need for domination and who dominate and threaten the child harshly and demand obedience to conventional behaviors with threats foster the characteristics of this personality In addition the parents have a preoccupation with social status and communicate this to the child in terms of rigid and externalized rules The child then suffers from suppressed feelings of resentment and aggression towards the parents who are instead idealized with reverence \n Alfred Adler \n provided another perspective linking the \"will to power over others\" as a central \n neurotic \n trait usually emerging as aggressive over- \n compensation \n for felt and dreaded feelings of inferiority and insignificance According to this view the authoritarian's need to maintain control and prove superiority over others is rooted in a \n worldview \n populated by enemies and empty of equality empathy and mutual benefit \n citation needed \n Early research \n These researchers' most noteworthy measurement for authoritarianism is the \"F-scale\" designed to tap a set of beliefs thought to be associated with authoritarianism without the need for specific out-groups indicated Kirscht and Dillehay \n outlined several problems with the Berkeley studies including response bias Response bias results from the F scale being uniformly worded in a confirming direction Hence if one tends to respond in agreement with items regardless of their content one is rated as an authoritarian by such a test Several studies have shown that more variance of the F scale can be explained by response bias than the content of the items Kirscht & Dillehay \n Actual assessment of Nazi criminals at Nuremberg trials reported in Zillmer \n et al \n conducted by clinicians using the Rorschach inkblots and in one study the F scale for authoritarianism found that these ex-Nazis score high on three dimensions anti-intraception superstition and stereotyping and projectivity but not all nine dimensions as the theory predicted \n One of the first applications of the authoritarian scales in academia was by Stern and colleagues in the early 1950s at the University of Chicago as reported in Wiggins \n The hypothesized prediction was that \"authoritarian\" students would have difficulty in the sciences and humanities and use of an attitudinal scale was a successful predictor \n Validity \n Soon after the publication of \n The Authoritarian Personality \n the theory became the subject of many criticisms Theoretical problems involved the psychoanalytic interpretation of personality and methodological problems focused on the inadequacies of the \n F-scale \n Another criticism is that the theory of the Berkeley group insinuates that authoritarianism exists only on the right of the political spectrum As a result some have claimed that the theory is corrupted by political bias Kreml found that although there were stylistic similarities between authoritarians and anti-authoritarians dogmatism rigidity etc construct variables like a the relative need for order b the relative need for power c rejection or acceptance of impulse and d extroversion versus introversion differentiated the two types and could underpin a full-spectrum psycho-political theory \n Wiggins provided an insightful explanation of how the authoritarian construct is an example of the synthetic approach to personality assessment In short in the synthetic approach the assumption is that those with authoritarian personality characteristics are assessed with researcher's intuitive model of what characteristics fit the criterion role requirements of the predicted situation support of Fascism Hence it is not a completely empirical approach to prediction but rather based on \"arm chair\" situational analysis of the criteria and intuited psychological characteristics to be assessed that fit the situation More recently Jost Glaser Kruglanski and Sulloway \n have presented how the traditional research in authoritarianism or conservatism has confounded the psychological variables e g personality characteristics with the political criteria conservative attitudes Hence the scales measuring individual differences on authoritarianism often include the criteria attitudinal statements of political ideologies \n Although the authoritarian is a personality construct Adorno et al proposed that the social environment influenced the expression of prejudice expressed based upon the \"climate of opinion\" that exists at the time Hence ideological beliefs created within the culture and other social forces shape the prejudices of the given authoritarian individual However as noted by Taylor \n this hypothesized interaction of society and the individual is lost to most of the subsequent research that implemented the F scale in differential psychological studies Given the science of personality assessment the variety of methods Adorno \n et al \n used are now unsupported and might explain that lack of empirical studies using the F scale or the other scales developed by Adorno \n et al \n in subsequent research An example of the social environment impact is presented by Gibb \n in his critique of personality traits and leadership where a study by Katz suggested that the social situation can override personality differences In the study groups of black and white students were formed Some mixed racial groups had students scoring high authoritarian F scores and in other mixed groups low F score students Comparisons of high authoritarian white students to those not scoring authoritarian indicated that the former student type were more cooperative and less willing to endorse stereotypes towards blacks Situational norms against prejudicial perceptions might have influenced authoritarian students to act less prejudicial in order to conform to the prescribed norm \n After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis Canadian psychologist \n Bob Altemeyer \n found in that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together authoritarian submission authoritarian aggression and conventionalism Almeyer added \"The reader familiar with the matter knows that most these criticisms of the \n Authoritarian Personality \n are over years old and now they might be considered little more than flaying a dead horse Unfortunately the flaying is necessary for the horse is not dead but still trotting aroundin various introductory psychology and developmental psychology textbooks for example \n Current reinterpretations \n Bob Altemeyer \n conducted a series of studies on what he labeled \n right-wing authoritarianism \n RWA and presents the most recent analysis of this personality type \n The focus of RWA research is political preferences as measured through surveys that suggest three tendencies as noted in attitudinal clusters These are submission to legitimate authorities aggression towards sanctioned targeted \n minority groups \n and adherence to values and beliefs perceived as endorsed by followed leadership McCrae & Costa \n report that the big dimension of openness to experience is negatively correlated to RWA r=-0 as measured by the NEO-PI-R Openness scale \n More recently Jost Glaser \n Kruglanski \n and Sulloway have proposed that authoritarianism RWA and other similar constructs of \n political conservatism \n are a form of motivated \n social cognition \n These researchers propose that conservatism has characteristics similar to those of authoritarianism with resistance to change and justification for inequality as the core components In addition conservative individuals have needs to manage uncertainty and threat with both situational motives e g striving for security and dominance in social hierarchies and dispositional motives e g terror management and self-esteem Despite its methodological deficiencies the theory of the authoritarian personality has had a major influence on research in political personality and social psychology \n

translated into how much labor they supply in the \n labor market \n Production within the household was not a subject that received systematic treatment by early economists \n In \n The Wealth of Nations \n Adam Smith alludes to the importance of the family in his chapter on Wages Smith wrote \"But though in disputes with their workmen masters must generally have the advantage there is however a certain rate below which it seems impossible to reduce for any considerable time the ordinary wages even of the lowest species of labour A man must always live by his work and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him They must even upon most occasions be somewhat more otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation \" \n Accordingly the wage received by the worker must be high enough to support the family in order to ensure the inter-generational reproduction of the working class \n Malthus \n added to this analysis in his theory of population growth where he argued that when wages are high laboring families tend to have more children causing increase in population and reduction in wages \n The reproduction of the labor force namely the way workers raise children to replace themselves is a central issue in Marxist Theory In \n Capital Volume I \n Marx argues that the amount of labor time that is necessary for the reproduction of workers is equal in value to the income they need to sustain a family which will raise a child to replace the worker This amount is called \n necessary labor time \n He calls \n surplus labor time \n the labor time that workers spend in addition to necessary time This implies that for Marx the wage that workers need to sustain their families is one of the basic factors that regulates the economy When he defines necessary labor time however Marx means the market labor necessary to earn the income that workers need so that their family can survive Some connect working class demands for a \n family wage \n in late 19th century to Marx's ideas male workers demanded that their wages be at a level sufficient to eliminate the need of wives and children to do market work \n There is nothing on the production occurring within the family in \n Capital \n Friedrich Engels \n wrote on how the economic structure of the \n family \n is shaped by the structure of class society \n According to Engels the \n monogamous \n family consisting of one man one woman and children is something created by the class system So are adultery and prostitution institutions that go together with the monogamous family system \n Pre-capitalistic forms of marriage discussed by Engels \n were group marriage and pairing marriage Engels argued \"with the ponderance of private property over communal property and the interest in its bequeathal father rights and monogamy gained supremacy\" \n He expected monogamy to disappear with the demise of capitalism He wrote that within the family men are like capitalists and women are like the proletariat and full freedom for women can only be possible if women will be brought \"back into public industry\" p as he expected would happen under \n socialism \n In his view under socialism women would not face the \n double burden \n of wage work and unpaid household work since he expected household tasks to be provided as public services Other Marxist economists of the late 19th and early 20th century like \n Bebel \n Luxemburg \n and Lenin also wrote on the necessity of bringing women back into the public industry \n The \n marginalist school \n developed in the late 19th century moved the focus of economics further away from family The focus of early marginalists like \n Lon Walras \n Stanley Jevons \n and \n Alfred Marshall \n was market transactions so any work done in the household was not of interest to marginalists The basic economic unit was either the individual or the household and when they took the household as the basic unit they were not interested in how decisions were made within a household \n In the 1920s and 30s economists like Eric Lindahl Einar Dahlgren \n Karin Kock \n and \n Simon Kuznets \n argued that production within the \n household \n was an important part of national production and without its inclusion \n GNP \n cannot be a complete indicator of national production level During the same period \n Hazel Kyrk \n Margaret Reid \n and Elizabeth Hoyt tried to develop a new field called consumption economics trying to bring \n consumption \n and production roles in the household within the sphere of economics \n The \n New Home Economics \n developed in the 1960s and continues to be one of the main approaches in the field of family economics in the 21st Century The household production functions introduced by Gary Becker in his article \"A Theory of Allocation of Time\" are used in the analysis of many household decisions Theodore W Schultz captured aspects of family that are important for the whole economy and that were emphasized by Becker and Mincer the founders of the NHE the production of human capital in the form of investing in children the maintenance of adults' \n human capital \n the way members of family allocate their time between market and household work and consumption decisions in the family \" \n Contemporary family economics has also been enriched by contributions of Marxists and radical feminists written since the 1970s While Marxism focuses on how class relationships and capitalism shapes family structure the focus of \n radical feminism \n was on gender patriarchy and men's domination of women in marriages and households \n Marxist-feminists \n subsequently sought to integrate these two approaches by trying to show how \n patriarchy \n and \n capitalism \n interact with each other \n Marriages as firms \n The idea that marriages are like firms can be found in the work of New Home economists Marxists and feminists Some Marxists and feminists view marriage of woman and man as analogous to the employment relationship in a capitalist society A worker who doesnt own any means of production is similar to a woman who can not earn enough income without a husband so the husband in a family is like the capitalist of a company \n An employment relationship between spouses also forms the basis of some analyses in the tradition of the NHE For example \n Shoshana Grossbard \n models both men and women as possibly hiring each other's work in household production which she calls \"spousal labor \n or \"Work-In-Household WiHo \" \n To the extent that husbands employ their wives' WiHo and pay them a low \"quasi-wage\" \n women can be considered as being exploited by their husbands as claimed by Marxist-feminist economists \n Legal ownership of the household is a question related to the analysis of marriages as firms \n Robert Ellickson \n has argued that owners of the household's capital should have more influence on decision-making related to the household than those who work in the household's production \n In contrast Grossbard has proposed that those doing the household's production should have more control over decisions than owners of the household's capital \n This is another example of parallels between Chicago-trained feminist economists and Marxist-feminist economists \n The question of how work in domestic production by one spouse is compensated by the other spouse who benefits from the work amounts to establishing terms of trade in a situation of specialization and division of labor Gary Becker has analyzed division of labor in the household in terms of comparative advantage generally assuming that women have a comparative advantage in household production and men in production outside the home \n This has led to a tendency for feminist economists to dismiss Becker's analyses of marriage \n Other economic explanations for marriage that have parallels in standard economic analyses of firms include explanations emphasizing \n risk pooling \n and consequently reductions in the risks of illness or being unemployed as a result of marriage and the role of marriages in facilitating specific investments such as children \n Division of labor within the family \n Family members divide their time between work inside the household and market work The family as a unit may decide on which member of the family will do which task Household work can be categorized in terms of whether the whole family benefits or only some members of the household Some call 'housework' activities benefiting the whole family like laundry or cleaning and 'carework' activities that are done specifically for another member of the household usually because that member is not able to do that work for himself or herself \n Two basic forms of \n carework \n are \n child care \n and \n elder care \n Household work benefiting the spouse more than the individual could include cooking or laundry as well as carework for spouses able to do the work themselves \n According to some \n neoclassical theories \n the division of labor between household and market work is related to the utility function of the individuals within the family In case a family has a greater preference for the goods that can be bought from the market they can allocate more time to market work and buy goods from the market If they have tastes for goods that are produced in the household they may prefer to do more household work and consume goods produced within the household \n Becker assumed that women have a \n comparative advantage \n in domestic work which means they are able to produce more within the household while men have a comparative advantage in market work which means that they are able to earn more compared with women According to such viewpoint when women specialize in household production and men specialize in market production and they share what they produce both men and women maximize their utilities \n However complete specialization can bring some risks and disadvantages the need for domestic work might decrease especially when children grow up and women who have completely specialized in household work might not be able to gain a decent wage when they return to market work when both spouses have some experience in domestic work they can be more independent in case of divorce or death of a spouse \n Barbara Bergman wrote that women's complete specialization in household labor namely their being full-time \n housewives \n often leads to women's financial insecurity and increases their likelihood of being subjected to \n domestic violence \n relative to situations of women working in the market and earning wages \n The game theoretic bargaining model offers an alternative framework to analyze the dynamics between household members in choosing consumption and production outcomes through a process of either explicit or implicit bargaining conflict and/or cooperation The bargaining model can assume that there is some gain to be made from entering into or remaining marriage but how each partner's labor time is distributed and how the goods and services they produce are distributed are matters for bargaining \n Bargaining processes with power considerations are formalized in Kaushik Basu's paper \"Gender and Say A Model of Household Behavior with Endogenously Determined Balance of Power\" \n In this approach power is distributed by the individual utility maximization function if one partner has greater earning power then that partner will have a better utility maximization position and the outcomes through bargaining feedback into the process by endogenously affecting the balance of power If the outcome favors one partners position than that partners power will be even more strengthened relative the other partner \n Participation of women in the labor market indicating that couples don't follow a traditional division of labor grew dramatically in the 19th and 20th Century This has been attributed by Jeremy Greenwood Ananth Seshadri and Mehmet Yorukoglu to the introduction of time-saving appliances in the home \n This growth in participation has been limited by institutional factors such as quotas on how many women can be employed in certain industries For example in England in the second half of the 19th century there was a campaign supported by working class men to restrict female market employment \n Similarly there have been bars on women's employment in the United States including laws preventing women from being employed after marriage \n In some countries like Japan there are still some quotas on the market employment of women or on the employment of married women Shoshana Grossbard has written on how marriage markets influence women's labor force participation \n Decision-making in the family \n Economists have different models of \n decision making \n regarding the allocation of labor within households Some assume that there is a single decision maker in the household \n If the head of the household is \n altruistic \n he will get some satisfaction when he makes a decision that takes into account the benefit of other household members Gary Becker argues that altruism of the decision maker of the household also benefits other members of the household because as a result of altruism he will make his decisions by taking into consideration the benefits of other members \n By doing this he will keep them within the household and increase their willingness to contribute more to the family Also according to Beckers \n rotten kid theorem \n even if one of the household members would want to harm another household member by contributing less to the family then the altruistic decision maker in the family might prevent that particular member from harming the other member In such a case an altruistic decision maker might arrange distribution within the household in such a way that the utility the rotten kid gets from the increase of family income will be more than the utility he gets from the harm the decrease of family income causes to the family member he envies \n Models of decision-making like Beckers altruism model dont take into account possible conflicts that decisions made by one of the household's members could create for other members \n Bargaining models \n are models that focus on how decision-making within the household may possibly proceed when such conflicts are taken into account \n These models assume that household decisions are made by a bargaining process They apply to bargaining between husband and wife or between parent and child Conflicts arises in case the outcome of a decision gives more utility to one party while the alternative decision is more advantage to the other party According to \n Amartya Sen \n in some cases the bargaining agents might not have full perceptions of either their economic contributions to the household or their interests Based on this possibility he adds two more factors that according to him will affect the bargaining outcomes \"the perception of contribution\" and \"the perception of self-interest\" If a party is more aware of his or her interests he or she will get better outcomes from the bargaining process Also if a person has a better sense of the value of his or her contribution to the family his or her power in the bargaining process will increase \n According to Sen when women do market work their bargaining power will improve in part due to better perceptions of contribution and self-interest As a result decisions made will benefit women more For example Sen has applied this bargaining framework to explain the shortfall of women in the population in some parts of the world \"the missing women\" problem \n in view of their more limited participation in paid work women have weaker bargaining power in the household more limited access to resources food care health access within the household relative to men and are therefore less likely to survive than in other parts of the world where women participate more in market work \n Others still model household members as independent individual decision-makers who possibly made decisions before the household was formed \n Cost

{"theme.id": 7, "title": "Reciprocal altruism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism", "depth": 1, "text": "Reciprocal altruism \n Diagram showing reciprocal altruism \n In \n evolutionary biology \n reciprocal altruism \n is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time The concept was initially developed by \n Robert Trivers \n to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts The concept is close to the strategy of \" \n tit for tat \n \" used in \n game theory \n Theory \n Examples \n Cleaner fish \n Warning calls in birds \n Nest protecting \n Vampire bats \n Primates \n Regulation by emotional disposition \n Theory \n The concept of \"reciprocal altruism\" as introduced by Trivers suggests that \n altruism \n defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the individual who helped them initially \n This concept finds its roots in the work of \n W D Hamilton \n who developed mathematical models for predicting the likelihood of an altruistic act to be performed on behalf of one's kin \n Putting this into the form of a strategy in a repeated \n prisoners dilemma \n would mean to cooperate unconditionally in the first period and behave cooperatively altruistically as long as the other agent does as well \n If chances of meeting another reciprocal altruist are high enough or if the game is repeated for a long enough amount of time this form of altruism can evolve within a population \n This is close to the notion of \" \n tit for tat \n \" introduced by \n Anatol Rapoport \n although there still seems a slight distinction in that \"tit for tat\" cooperates in the first period and from thereon always replicates an opponents previous action whereas reciprocal altruists stop cooperation in the first instance of non-cooperation by an opponent and stay non-cooperative from thereon This distinction leads to the fact that in contrast to reciprocal altruism tit for tat may be able to restore cooperation under certain conditions despite cooperation having broken down \n Christopher Stephens shows a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for an instance of reciprocal altruism \n the behaviour must reduce a donor's fitness relative to a selfish alternative \n the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to non-recipients \n the performance of the behaviour must not depend on the receipt of an immediate benefit \n conditions and must apply to both individuals engaging in reciprocal helping \n There are two additional conditions necessary \"for reciprocal altruism to evolve \" \n A mechanism for detecting 'cheaters' must exist \n A large indefinite number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist \n The first two conditions are necessary for altruism as such while the third is distinguishing reciprocal altruism from simple mutualism and the fourth makes the interaction reciprocal Condition number five is required as otherwise non-altruists may always exploit altruistic behaviour without any consequences and therefore evolution of reciprocal altruism would not be possible However it is pointed out that this conditioning device does not need to be conscious Condition number six is required to avoid cooperation breakdown through backwards inductiona possibility suggested by game theoretical models \n Examples \n The following examples could be understood as altruism However showing reciprocal altruism in an unambiguous way requires more evidence as will be shown later \n Cleaner fish \n Further information \n Cleaning symbiosis \n Cleaning symbiosis \n a small cleaner \n wrasse \n Labroides dimidiatus \n with \n advertising coloration \n services a big eye squirrelfish \n Priacanthus hamrur \n in an apparent example of reciprocal altruism \n An example of reciprocal altruism is \n cleaning symbiosis \n such as between \n cleaner fish \n and their hosts though cleaners include shrimps and birds and clients include fish turtles octopuses and mammals \n Aside from the apparent \n symbiosis \n of the cleaner and the host during actual cleaning which cannot be interpreted as altruism the host displays additional behaviour that meets the criteria for altruism \n The host fish allows the cleaner fish free entrance and exit and does not eat the cleaner even after the cleaning is done \n The host signals the cleaner it is about to depart the cleaner's locality even when the cleaner is not in its body The host sometimes chases off possible dangers to the cleaner \n The following evidence supports the hypothesis \n The cleaning by cleaners is essential for the host In the absence of cleaners the hosts leave the locality or suffer from injuries inflicted by ecto-parasites \n There is difficulty and danger in finding a cleaner Hosts leave their element to get cleaned \n Others wait no longer than seconds before searching for cleaners elsewhere \n A key requirement for the establishment of reciprocal altruism is that the same two individuals must interact repeatedly as otherwise the best strategy for the host would be to eat the cleaner as soon as cleaning was complete This constraint imposes both a spatial and a temporal condition on the cleaner and on its host Both individuals must remain in the same physical location and both must have a long enough lifespan to enable multiple interactions There is reliable evidence that individual cleaners and hosts do indeed interact repeatedly \n This example meets some but not all of the criteria described in Triverss model In the cleaner-host system the benefit to the cleaner is always immediate However the evolution of reciprocal altruism is contingent on opportunities for future rewards through repeated interactions In one study nearby host fish observed \"cheater\" cleaners and subsequently avoided them \n In these examples true reciprocity is difficult to demonstrate since failure means the death of the cleaner However if Randalls claim that hosts sometimes chase off possible dangers to the cleaner is correct an experiment might be constructed in which reciprocity could be demonstrated \n Warning calls in birds \n Eurasian jay \n Garrulus glandarius \n gives loud alarm calls from its tree perch when it sees a predator \n Further information \n Signalling theory \n Warning calls although exposing a bird and putting it in danger are frequently given by birds An explanation in terms of altruistic behaviors given by Trivers \n It has been shown that predators learn specific localities and specialize individually on prey types and hunting techniques \n It is therefore disadvantageous for a bird to have a predator eat a conspecific because the experienced predator may then be more likely to eat him Alarming another bird by giving a warning call tends to prevent predators from specializing on the callers species and locality In this way birds in areas in which warning calls are given will be at a selective advantage relative to birds in areas free from warning calls \n Nevertheless this presentation lacks important elements of reciprocity It is very hard to detect and ostracize cheaters There is no evidence that a bird refrains from giving calls when another bird is not reciprocating nor evidence that individuals interact repeatedly Given the aforementioned characteristics of bird calling a continuous bird emigration and immigration environment true of many avian species is most likely to be partial to cheaters since selection against the \n selfish gene \n is unlikely \n Another explanation for warning calls is that these are not warning calls at all A bird once it has detected a bird of prey calls to signal to the bird of prey that it was detected and that there is no use trying to attack the calling bird Two facts support this hypothesis \n The call frequencies match the hearing range of the predator bird \n Calling birds are less attackedpredator birds attack calling birds less frequently than other birds \n Nest protecting \n Arctic terns \n protect their offspring extremely aggressively by very quick drop-downs from a stationary flight over their enemies Other birds often benefit from this behavior by breeding very close to the Arctic terns \n Red-winged blackbird \n males help defend neighbor's nests There are many theories as to why males behave this way One is that males only defend other nests which contain their extra-pair offspring Extra-pair offspring is juveniles which may contain some of the male bird's DNA Another is the tit-for-tat strategy of reciprocal altruism A third theory is males help only other closely related males A study done by The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife provided evidence that males used a tit-for-tat strategy The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife tested many different nests by placing stuffed crows by nests and then observing behavior of neighboring males The behaviors they looked for included the number of calls dives and strikes After analyzing the results there was not significance evidence for kin selection the presence of extra-pair offspring did not affect the probability of help in nest defense However males reduced the amount of defense given to neighbors when neighbor males reduced defense for their nests This demonstrates a tit-for-tat strategy where animals help those who previously helped them This strategy is one type of reciprocal altruism \n Vampire bats \n Vampire bats \n also display reciprocal altruism as described by Wilkinson \n The bats feed each other by regurgitating blood Since bats only feed on blood and will die after just hours of not eating this food sharing is a great benefit to the receiver and a great cost to the giver \n To qualify for reciprocal altruism the benefit to the receiver would have to be larger than the cost to the donor This seems to hold as these bats usually die if they do not find a blood meal two nights in a row Also the requirement that individuals who have behaved altruistically in the past are helped by others in the future is confirmed by the data \n However the consistency of the reciprocal behaviour namely that a previously non-altruistic bat is refused help when it requires it has not been demonstrated Therefore the bats do not seem to qualify yet as an example for reciprocal altruism However a closer look at the data shows that except for a single interaction all instances of feeding happened between individuals of the same group who are on average cousins \n Thus it seems much more probable that this example is a case of \n kin selection \n than reciprocal altruism \n Primates \n Grooming in primates meets the conditions for reciprocal altruism according to some studies One of the studies in vervet monkeys shows that among unrelated individuals grooming induce higher chance of attending to each other's calls for aid \n However vervet monkeys also display grooming behaviors within group members displaying alliances \n This would demonstrate vervet monkey's grooming behavior as a part of kin selection since the activity is done between siblings in this study Moreover following the criteria by Stephen \n if the study is to be an example of reciprocal altruism it must prove the mechanism for detecting cheaters \n Regulation by emotional disposition \n In comparison to that of other animals the human altruistic system is a sensitive and unstable one \n Therefore the tendency to give to cheat and the response to others acts of giving and cheating must be regulated by a complex psychology in each individual social structures and cultural traditions Individuals differ in the degree of these tendencies and responses According to \n Trivers \n the following emotional dispositions and their evolution can be understood in terms of regulation of altruism \n Friendship and emotions of liking and disliking \n Moralistic aggression A protection mechanism from cheaters acts to regulate the advantage of cheaters in selection against altruists The moralistic altruist may want to educate or even punish a cheater \n Gratitude and sympathy A fine regulation of altruism can be associated with gratitude and sympathy in terms of cost/benefit and the level in which the beneficiary will reciprocate \n Guilt and reparative altruism Prevents the cheater from cheating again The cheater shows regret to avoid paying too dearly for past acts \n Subtle cheating A stable evolutionary equilibrium could include a low percentage of mimics in controversial support of adaptive sociopathy \n Trust and suspicion These are regulators for cheating and subtle cheating \n Partnerships Altruism to create friendships \n It is not known how individuals pick partners as there has been little research on choice Modeling indicates that altruism about partner choices is unlikely to evolve as costs and benefits between multiple individuals are variable \n Therefore the time or frequency of reciprocal actions contributes more to an individual's choice of partner than the reciprocal act itself \n Altruism biology \n

never be duplicated \n Since it has been known that \n DNA \n is the main physical substrate to genetic information and it is capable of high-fidelity \n replication \n through many generations So a particular gene coded in a \n nucleobase \n sequence of a lineage of replicated DNA molecules can have a high permanence and a low rate of endogenous change \n In normal sexual reproduction an entire \n genome \n is the unique combination of father's and mother's chromosomes produced at the moment of fertilization It is generally destroyed with its organism because \" \n meiosis \n and \n recombination \n destroy genotypes as surely as death \" \n Only half of it is transmitted to each descendant due to \n independent segregation \n And the high prevalence of horizontal gene transfer in \n bacteria \n and \n archaea \n means that genomic combinations of these asexually reproducing groups are also transient in evolutionary time \"The traditional view that prokaryotic evolution can be understood primarily in terms of clonal divergence and periodic selection must be augmented to embrace gene exchange as a creative force \" \n The gene as an informational entity persists for an evolutionarily significant span of time through a lineage of many physical copies \n In his book \n River out of Eden \n Dawkins coins the phrase \n God's utility function \n to explain his view on genes as units of selection He uses this phrase as a synonym of the \" \n meaning of life \n \" or the \"purpose of life\" By rephrasing the word \n purpose \n in terms of what \n economists \n call a \n utility function \n meaning \"that which is maximized\" Dawkins attempts to \n reverse-engineer \n the purpose in the mind of the Divine Engineer of Nature or the \n utility function of god \n Finally Dawkins argues that it is a mistake to assume that an \n ecosystem \n or a \n species \n as a whole exists for a purpose He writes that it is incorrect to suppose that individual organisms lead a meaningful life either in nature only genes have a utility function to perpetuate their own existence with indifference to great sufferings inflicted upon the organisms they build exploit and discard \n Organisms as vehicles \n Genes are usually packed together inside a genome which is itself contained inside an organism Genes group together into genomes because \"genetic replication makes use of energy and substrates that are supplied by the metabolic economy in much greater quantities than would be possible without a genetic division of labour \" \n They build vehicles to promote their mutual interests of jumping into the next generation of vehicles As Dawkins puts it organisms are the \" \n survival machines \n \" of genes \n The phenotypic effect of a particular gene is contingent on its environment including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome A gene never has a fixed effect so how is it possible to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic \n differences \n between alleles One may say that one allele all other things being equal or varying within certain limits causes greater legs than its alternative This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection \n \"A gene can have multiple phenotypic effects each of which may be of positive negative or neutral value It is the net selective value of a gene's phenotypic effect that determines the fate of the gene \" \n For instance a gene can cause its bearer to have greater reproductive success at a young age but also cause a greater likelihood of death at a later age If the benefit outweighs the harm averaged out over the individuals and environments in which the gene happens to occur then phenotypes containing the gene will generally be positively selected and thus the abundance of that gene in the population will increase \n Even so it becomes necessary to model the genes in combination with their vehicle as well as in combination with the vehicle's environment \n Selfish-gene theory \n The selfish-gene theory of natural selection can be restated as follows \n Genes do not present themselves naked to the scrutiny of natural selection instead they present their phenotypic effects Differences in genes give rise to differences in these phenotypic effects Natural selection acts on the phenotypic differences and thereby on genes Thus genes come to be represented in successive generations in proportion to the selective value of their phenotypic effects \n Cronin p \n The result is that \"the prevalent genes in a sexual population must be those that as a mean condition through a large number of genotypes in a large number of situations have had the most favourable phenotypic effects for their own replication \" \n In other words we expect selfish genes \"selfish\" meaning that it promotes its own survival without necessarily promoting the survival of the organism group or even species This theory implies that \n adaptations \n are the phenotypic effects of genes to maximize their representation in future generations An adaptation is maintained by selection if it promotes genetic survival directly or else some subordinate goal that ultimately contributes to successful reproduction \n Individual altruism and genetic egoism \n The gene is a unit of hereditary information that exists in many physical copies in the world and which particular physical copy will be replicated and originate new copies does not matter from the gene's point of view \n A selfish gene could be favored by selection by producing altruism among organisms containing it The idea is summarized as follows \n If a gene copy confers a benefit \n B \n on another vehicle at cost \n C \n to its own vehicle its costly action is strategically beneficial if \n pB > C \n where \n p \n is the probability that a copy of the gene is present in the vehicle that benefits Actions with substantial costs therefore require significant values of \n p \n Two kinds of factors ensure high values of \n p \n relatedness kinship and recognition green beards \n Haig \n p \n A gene in a \n somatic \n cell of an individual may forego replication to promote the transmission of its copies in the germ line cells It ensures the high value of \n p = \n due to their constant contact and their common origin from the \n zygote \n The \n kin selection \n theory predicts that a gene may promote the recognition of kinship by historical continuity a mammalian mother learns to identify her own offspring in the act of giving birth a male preferentially directs resources to the offspring of mothers with whom he has copulated the other chicks in a nest are siblings and so on The expected altruism between kin is calibrated by the value of \n p \n also known as the \n coefficient of relatedness \n For instance an individual has a \n p = 1/2 \n in relation to his brother and \n p = 1/8 \n to his cousin so we would expect \n ceteris paribus \n greater altruism among brothers than among cousins In this vein geneticist \n J B S Haldane \n famously joked \"Would I lay down my life to save my brother? No but I would to save two brothers or eight cousins \" \n However examining the human propensity for altruism kin selection theory seems incapable of explaining cross-familiar cross-racial and even cross-species acts of kindness \n Green-beard effect \n Green-beard effects \n gained their name from a thought-experiment of Richard Dawkins \n who considered the possibility of a gene that caused its possessors to develop a green beard and to be nice to other green-bearded individuals Since then \"green-beard effect\" has come to refer to forms of genetic self-recognition in which a gene in one individual might direct benefits to other individuals that possess the gene Such genes would be \n especially selfish \n benefiting themselves regardless of the fates of their vehicles After Dawklns predicted them green-beard gene have been discovered in nature such as \n Gp-9 \n in fire ants \n Solenopsis invicta \n csA \n in social amoeba \n Dictyostelium discoideum \n and FLO1 in

kindness is capable of explaining the vast majority of altruism that is generally accepted as \"good\" by modern societies Imagine a green-bearding behavioral trait whose recognition does not depend on the recognition of some external feature such as beard color but relies on recognition of the behavior itself Imagine now that the behavior is altruistic The success of such a trait in sufficiently intelligent and undeceived organisms is implicit Moreover the existence of such a trait predicts a tendency for kindness to unrelated organisms that are apparently kind even if the organisms are of a completely different species Moreover the gene need not be exactly the same so long as the effect is similar Multiple versions of the geneor even \n meme \n would have virtually the same effect in a sort of \n symbiotic \n green-bearding cycle of altruism \n Deceit \n Whenever recognition plays a role in evolution so does deception Just like the harmless lizard that has evolved a pattern that mimics its poisonous cousin and therefore tricks predators the selfish creature may pretend to be kind by \"growing a green beard\" whatever that green beard may be Thus green-bearding and the selfish-gene theory also give rise to an explanation for the evolution of lies and deceit characteristics that do not benefit the population as a whole \n Intragenomic conflict \n Intragenomic conflict \n As genes are capable of producing individual altruism they are capable of producing conflict among genes inside the genome of one individual This phenomenon is called \n intragenomic conflict \n and arises when one gene promotes its own replication in detriment to other genes in the genome The classic example is segregation distorter genes that cheat during \n meiosis \n or \n gametogenesis \n and end up in more than half of the functional \n gametes \n These genes persist even resulting in reduced \n fertility \n Egbert Leigh compared the genome to \"a parliament of genes each acts in its own self-interest but if its acts hurt the others they will combine together to suppress it\" to explain the relative low occurrence of intragenomic conflict \n Price equation \n Price equation \n The \n Price equation \n is a \n covariance \n equation that is a mathematical description of \n evolution \n and \n natural selection \n The Price equation was derived by \n George R Price \n working in \n London \n to rederive \n W D Hamilton \n 's work on \n kin selection \n Advocates \n Besides \n Richard Dawkins \n and \n George C Williams \n other \n biologists \n and \n philosophers \n have expanded and refined the selfish-gene theory such as \n John Maynard Smith \n George R Price \n Robert Trivers \n David Haig \n Helena Cronin \n David Hull \n Philip Kitcher \n and \n Daniel C Dennett \n Criticisms \n The gene-centric view has been opposed by \n Ernst Mayr \n Stephen Jay Gould \n David Sloan Wilson \n and philosopher \n Elliott Sober \n An alternative \n multilevel selection \n MLS has been advocated by \n E O Wilson \n David Sloan Wilson Sober Richard E Michod \n and \n Samir Okasha \n Writing in the \n New York Review of Books \n Gould has characterized the gene-centered perspective as confusing book-keeping with \n causality \n Gould views selection as working on many levels and has called attention to a hierarchical perspective of selection Gould also called the claims of \n Selfish Gene \n \"strict \n adaptationism \n \" \"ultra-Darwinism\" and \"Darwinian \n fundamentalism \n \" describing them as excessively \" \n reductionist \n \" He saw the theory as leading to a simplistic \"algorithmic\" theory of evolution or even to the re-introduction of a \n teleological principle \n Mayr went so far as to say \"Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian \" \n Gould also addressed the issue of selfish genes in his essay \"Caring groups and selfish genes\" \n Gould acknowledged that Dawkins was not imputing conscious action to genes but simply using a shorthand metaphor commonly found in evolutionary writings To Gould the fatal flaw was that \"no matter how much power Dawkins wishes to assign to genes there is one thing that he cannot give them direct visibility to natural selection \" \n Rather the unit of selection is the phenotype not the genotype because it is phenotypes that interact with the environment at the natural-selection interface So in \n Kim Sterelny \n 's summation of Gould's view \"gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations they register those changes \" \n Richard Dawkins replied to this criticism in a later book \n The Extended Phenotype \n that Gould confused particulate genetics with particulate embryology stating that genes do \"blend\" as far as their effects on developing phenotypes are concerned but that they do not blend as they replicate and recombine down the generations \n Since Gould's death in \n Niles Eldredge \n has continued with counter-arguments to gene-centered natural selection \n Eldredge notes that in Dawkins' book \n A Devil's Chaplain \n which was published just before Eldredge's book \"Richard Dawkins comments on what he sees as the main difference between his position and that of the late Stephen Jay Gould He concludes that it is his own vision that genes play a causal role in evolution \" while Gould and Eldredge \"sees genes as passive recorders of what worked better than what\" \n Evolutionary biology portal \n Book Evolutionary psychology \n

According to \n Giovanni Pico della Mirandola \n a student of Ficino truth could be found in many rather than just two traditions \n According to \n Agostino Steuco \n there is \"one principle of all things of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples \" \n Traditionalist School \n The contemporary scholarly oriented \n Traditionalist School \n continues this metaphysical orientation According to the Traditionalist School the Perennial Philosophy is \"absolute Truth and infinite Presence \" \n Absolute Truth is \"the perennial wisdom \n sophia perennis \n that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind \" \n Infinite Presence is \"the perennial religion \n religio perennis \n that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions \" \n The Traditionalist School discerns a transcendent and an immanent dimension namely the discernment of the Real or \n Absolute \n c q that which is permanent and the intentional \"mystical concentration on the Real \" \n According to Soares de Azevedo the Perennialist philosophy states that the universal truth is the same within each of the world's orthodox religious traditions and is the foundation of their religious knowledge and doctrine Each world religion is an interpretation of this universal truth adapted to cater for the psychological intellectual and social needs of a given culture of a given period of history This perennial truth has been rediscovered in each epoch by \n mystics \n of all kinds who have revived already existing religions when they had fallen into empty platitudes and hollow ceremonialism \n pageneeded \n Shipley further notes that the Traditionalist School is oriented on orthodox traditions and rejects modern syncretism and universalism which creates new religions from older religions and compromise the standing traditions \n Aldous Huxley and mystical universalism \n One such universalist was Aldous Huxley \n who propagated a universalist interpretation of the world religions inspired by Vivekananda's \n neo-Vedanta \n According to Aldous Huxley who popularized the idea of a Perennial philosophy with a larger audience \n The Perennial Philosophy is expressed most succinctly in the Sanskrit formula \n tat tvam asi \n 'That thou art' the Atman or immanent eternal Self is one with Brahman the Absolute Principle of all existence and the last end of every human being is to discover the fact for himself to find out who he really is \n In Huxley's essay in \n Vedanta and the West \n he describes \n The Minimum Working Hypothesis \n the basic outline of the Perennial Philosophy found in all the mystic branches of the religions of the world \n That there is a Godhead or Ground which is the unmanifested principle of all manifestation \n That the Ground is transcendent and immanent \n That it is possible for human beings to love know and from virtually to become actually identified with the Ground \n That to achieve this unitive knowledge to realize this supreme identity is the final end and purpose of human existence \n That there is a Law or Dharma which must be obeyed a Tao or Way which must be followed if men are to achieve their final end \n Origins \n Main articles \n Neo-Platonism \n and \n Agape \n The Perennial philosophy originates from a blending of neo-Platonism and \n Christianity \n Neo-Platonism itself has diverse origins in the syncretic culture of the \n Hellenistic period \n and was an influential philosophy throughout the Middle Ages \n Classical world \n Hellenistic period - religious syncretism \n Religious syncretism \n During the \n Hellenistic period \n Alexander the Great \n 's \n campaigns \n brought about exchange of cultural ideas on its path throughout most of the known world of his era The Greek \n Eleusinian Mysteries \n and \n Dionysian Mysteries \n mixed with such influences as the \n Cult of Isis \n Mithraism \n and \n Hinduism \n along with some Persian influences Such \n cross-cultural \n exchange was not new to the Greeks the \n Egyptian god \n Osiris and the \n Greek god \n Dionysus had been equated as \n Osiris-Dionysus \n by the historian Herodotus as early as the 5th century BC see \n Interpretatio graeca \n Roman world - Philo of Alexandria \n Philo \n of Alexandria c BCE c CE attempted to reconcile Greek Rationalism with the Torah which helped pave the way for Christianity with \n Neo-Platonism \n and the adoption of the Old Testament with Christianity as opposed to Gnostic Marcion roots of Christianity \n citation needed \n Philo translated \n Judaism \n into terms of \n Stoic \n Platonic \n and \n Neopythagorean \n elements and held that God is \"supra rational\" and can be reached only through \"ecstasy \" He also held that the \n oracles \n of God supply the material of moral and religious knowledge \n Neo-Platonism \n Neoplatonism \n Neoplatonism arose in the 3rd century CE and persisted until shortly after the closing of the \n Platonic Academy \n in Athens in AD by \n Justinian I \n Neoplatonists were heavily influenced by \n Plato \n but also by the Platonic tradition that thrived during the six centuries which separated the first of the Neoplatonists from Plato The work of Neoplatonic philosophy involved describing the derivation of the whole of reality from a single principle \"the One \" It was founded by \n Plotinus \n web \n and has been very influential throughout history In the \n Middle Ages \n Neoplatonic ideas were integrated into the philosophical and theological works of many of the most important medieval Islamic Christian and Jewish thinkers \n Renaissance \n Ficino and Pico della Mirandola \n Marsilio Ficino \n believed that \n Hermes Trismegistos \n the supposed author of the \n Corpus Hermeticum \n was a contemporary of Mozes and the teacher of \n Pythagoras \n and the source of both Greek and Jewish-Christian thought \n He argued that there is an underlying unity to the world the soul or love which has a counterpart in the realm of ideas Platonic Philosophy and Christian theology both embody this truth Ficino was influenced by a variety of philosophers including Aristotelian \n Scholasticism \n and various pseudonymous and mystical writings Ficino saw his thought as part of a long development of philosophical truth of ancient pre-Platonic philosophers including \n Zoroaster \n Hermes Trismegistus \n Orpheus \n Aglaophemus and \n Pythagoras \n who reached their peak in Plato The \n Prisca theologia \n or venerable and ancient theology which embodied the truth and could be found in all ages was a vitally important idea for Ficino \n Giovanni Pico della Mirandola \n a student of Ficino went further than his teacher by suggesting that truth could be found in many rather than just two traditions This proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle and saw aspects of the \n Prisca theologia \n in \n Averroes \n the \n Koran \n the \n Cabala \n among other sources \n After the deaths of Pico and Ficino this line of thought expanded and included \n Symphorien Champier \n and \n Francesco Giorgio \n Steuco \n De perenni philosophia libri X \n The term \n perenni philosophia \n was first used by \n Agostino Steuco \n who used it to title a treatise \n De perenni philosophia libri X \n published in \n De perenni philosophia \n was the most sustained attempt at philosophical synthesis and harmony \n Steuco represents the liberal wing of 16th-century Biblical scholarship and theology although he rejected Luther and Calvin \n De perenni philosophia \n is a complex work which only contains the term philosophia perennis twice It states that there is \"one principle of all things of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples \" \n This single knowledge or sapientia is the key element in his philosophy In that he emphasises continuity over progress Steuco's idea of philosophy is not one conventionally associated with the \n Renaissance \n Indeed he tends to believe that the truth is lost over time and is only preserved in the \n prisci theologica \n Steuco preferred Plato to Aristotle and saw greater congruence between the former and Christianity than the latter philosopher He held that philosophy works in harmony with religion and should lead to knowledge of God and that truth flows from a single source more ancient than the Greeks Steuco was strongly influenced by \n Iamblichus \n 's statement that knowledge of God is innate in all \n and also gave great importance to Hermes Trismegistus \n Influence \n Steuco's perennial philosophy was highly regarded by some scholars for the two centuries after its publication then largely forgotten until it was rediscovered by Otto Willmann in the late part of the 19th century \n Overall \n De perenni philosophia \n wasn't particularly influential and largely confined to those with a similar orientation to himself The work was not put on the \n Index \n of works banned by the Roman Catholic Church although his \n Cosmopoeia \n which expressed similar ideas was Religious criticisms tended to the conservative view that held Christian teachings should be understood as unique rather than seeing them as perfect expressions of truths that are found everywhere \n More generally this philosophical \n syncretism \n was set out at the expense of some of the doctrines included within it and it is possible that Steuco's critical faculties were not up to the task he had set himself Further placing so much confidence in the prisca theologia turned out to be a shortcoming as many of the texts used in this school of thought later turned out to be bogus \n In the following two centuries the most favourable responses were largely Protestant and often in England \n Gottfried Leibniz \n later picked up on Steuco's term The German philosopher stands in the tradition of this concordistic philosophy his \n philosophy of harmony \n especially had affinity with Steuco's ideas Leibniz knew about Steuco's work by but thought that \n De la Verite de la Religion Chretienne \n by Huguenot philosopher \n Phillippe du Plessis-Mornay \n expressed the same truth better Steuco's influence can be found throughout Leibniz's works but the German was the first philosopher to refer to the perennial philosophy without mentioning the Italian \n Popularisation \n Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism \n Main articles \n

endorsed \n universalist \n and \n Unitarianist \n ideas leading to \n Unitarian Universalism \n the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well since a loving God would redeem all living beings not just Christians \n web \n web \n Theosophical Society \n Theosophical Society \n By the end of the 19th century the idea of a Perennial Philosophy was popularized by leaders of the Theosophical Society such as \n H P Blavatsky \n and \n Annie Besant \n under the name of \"Wisdom-Religion\" or \"Ancient Wisdom\" \n The Theosophical Society took an active interest in Asian religions subsequently not only bringing those religions under the attention of a western audience but also influencing Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Japan \n Neo-Vedanta \n Main articles \n Advaita Vedanta \n Neo-Vedanta \n Hinduism in the West \n and \n Neo-Advaita \n Many perennialist thinkers including Armstrong Huston Smith and \n Joseph Campbell \n are influenced by Hindu reformer \n Ram Mohan Roy \n and Hindu mystics \n Ramakrishna \n and \n Swami Vivekananda \n who themselves have taken over western notions of universalism \n They regarded Hinduism to be a token of this Perennial Philosophy This notion has influenced thinkers who have proposed versions of the perennial philosophy in the 20th century \n The unity of all religions was a central impulse among Hindu reformers in the 19th century who in turn influenced many 20th-century perennial philosophy-type thinkers Key figures in this reforming movement included two Bengali Brahmins \n Ram Mohan Roy \n a philosopher and the founder of the modernising \n Brahmo Samaj \n religious organisation reasoned that the divine was beyond description and thus that no religion could claim a monopoly in their understanding of it \n The mystic \n Ramakrishna \n 's spiritual ecstasies included experiencing the sameness of Christ Mohammed and his own Hindu deity Ramakrishna's most famous disciple \n Swami Vivekananda \n travelled to the United States in the 1890s where he formed the \n Vedanta Society \n Roy Ramakrishna and Vivekananda were all influenced by the Hindu school of \n Advaita Vedanta \n which they saw as the exemplification of a Universalist Hindu religiosity \n Traditionalist School \n Traditionalist School \n The Traditionalist School was a group of 20th century thinkers concerned with what they considered to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge both aesthetic and spiritual within Western society The principal thinkers in this tradition are \n Ren Gunon \n Ananda Coomaraswamy \n and \n Frithjof Schuon \n Other important thinkers in this tradition include \n Titus Burckhardt \n Martin Lings \n Jean-Louis Michon \n Marco Pallis \n Huston Smith \n Hossein Nasr \n Jean Borella \n According to the Traditionalist School orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin According to the Traditionalist School the \"philosophia perennis\" designates a worldview that is opposed to the \n scientism \n of modern \n secular \n societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular \n developed world \n citation needed \n This view is exemplified by \n Rene Guenon \n in his \n magnum opus \n and one of the founding works of the \n traditionalist school \n The Reign of Quantity and The Sign of the Times \n According to \n Frithjof Schuon \n It has been said more than once that total Truth is inscribed in an eternal script in the very substance of our spirit what the different Revelations do is to \"crystallize\" and \"actualize\" in different degrees according to the case a nucleus of certitudes which not only abides forever in the divine Omniscience but also sleeps by refraction in the \"naturally supernatural\" kernel of the individual as well as in that of each ethnic or historical collectivity or of the human species as a whole \n Aldous Huxley \n The Perennial Philosophy \n The term was popularized in more recent times by \n Aldous Huxley \n who was profoundly influenced by \n Vivekananda's \n Neo-Vedanta \n and \n Universalism \n In his book \n The Perennial Philosophy \n he defined the Perennial philosophy as \n the \n metaphysic \n that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds the \n psychology \n that finds in the soul something similar to or even identical to divine Reality the \n ethic \n that places man's final end in the knowledge of the \n immanent \n and \n transcendent \n Ground of all being \n the thing is immemorial and universal Rudiments of the perennial philosophy may be found among the traditional lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions \n In contrast to the Traditionalist school Huxley emphasized \n mystical experience \n over metaphysics \n The Buddha declined to make any statement in regard to the ultimate divine Reality All he would talk about was Nirvana which is the name of the \n experience that comes to \n the totally selfless and one-pointed Maintaining in this matter the attitude of a strict operationalist the Buddha would speak only of the spiritual experience not of the metaphysical entity presumed by the theologians of other religions as also of later Buddhism to be the object and since in contemplation the knower the known and the knowledge are all one at the same time the subject and substance of that experience \n According to Aldous Huxley in order to apprehend the divine reality one must choose to fulfill certain conditions \"making themselves loving pure in heart and poor in spirit \" \n Huxley argues that very few people can achieve this state Those who have fulfilled these conditions grasped the universal truth and interpreted it have generally been given the name of saint prophet sage or enlightened one \n Huxley argues that those who have \"modified

\n New Age \n and \n New Age Movement \n The idea of a Perennial Philosophy is central to the New Age Movement The New Age movement is a \n Western \n spiritual \n movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century Its central precepts have been described as \"drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and \n metaphysical \n traditions and infusing them with influences from \n self-help \n and motivational \n psychology \n holistic health \n parapsychology \n consciousness research and \n quantum physics \n \" \n The term \n New Age \n refers to the coming \n astrological \n Age of Aquarius \n web \n The New Age aims to create \"a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas\" that is inclusive and \n pluralistic \n It holds to \"a holistic worldview\" \n emphasising that the \n Mind Body and Spirit \n are interrelated \n web \n and that there is a form of \n monism \n and unity throughout the universe \n It attempts to create \"a worldview that includes both science and spirituality\" \n and embraces a number of forms of \n mainstream science \n as well as other forms of science that are considered \n fringe \n Academic discussions \n Mystical experience \n Mystical experience \n The idea of a perennial philosophy sometimes called perennialism is a key area of debate in the academic discussion of mystical experience Huston Smith notes that the Traditionalist School's vision of a Perennial philosophy is not based on mystical experiences but on metaphysical intuitions \n The discussion of mystical experience has shifted the emphasis in the perennial philosophy from these metaphysical intuitions to religious experience \n and the notion of \n nonduality \n or \n altered state of consciousness \n William James \n popularized the use of the term \"religious experience\" in his \n The Varieties of Religious Experience \n It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge \n web \n Writers such as \n WT Stace \n Huston Smith \n and \n Robert Forman \n argue that there are core similarities to mystical experience across religions cultures and eras \n For Stace the universality of this core experience is a necessary although not sufficient condition for one to be able to trust the cognitive content of any religious experience \n verification needed \n Wayne Proudfoot \n traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" further back to the German theologian \n Friedrich Schleiermacher \n who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique It was adopted by many scholars of religion of which William James was the most influential \n Critics point out that the emphasis on \"experience\" favours the atomic individual instead of the community It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience and mysticism as a process embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy scripture worship virtues theology rituals and practices \n Richard King also points to disjunction between \"mystical experience\" and social justice \n The privatisation of mysticism - that is the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences - serves to exclude it from political issues such as social justice Mysticism thus comes to be seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity which rather than serving to transform the world reconcile the individual to the status quo by alleviating anxiety and stress \n Religious pluralism \n Religious pluralism \n Religious pluralism \n holds that various world religions are limited by their distinctive historical and cultural contexts and thus there is no single true religion There are only many equally valid religions Each religion is a direct result of humanity's attempt to grasp and understand the incomprehensible divine reality Therefore each religion has an authentic but ultimately inadequate perception of divine reality producing a partial understanding of the universal truth which requires syncretism to achieve a complete understanding as well as a path towards salvation or spiritual enlightenment \n Although perennial philosophy also holds that there is no single true religion it differs when discussing divine reality Perennial philosophy states that the divine reality is what allows the universal truth to be understood \n Each religion provides its own interpretation of the universal truth based on its historical and cultural context Therefore each religion provides everything required to observe the divine reality and achieve a state in which one will be able to confirm the universal truth and achieve salvation or spiritual enlightenment \n Ivan Aguli \n Archetypes \n Olavo de Carvalho \n Henry Corbin \n Julius

\n jokes \n They include \n material culture \n ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group Folklore also includes \n customary lore \n the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings folk dances and initiation rites Each one of these either singly or in combination is considered a \n folklore artifact \n Just as essential as the form folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the \n fine arts \n Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration The academic study of folklore is called \n

Context of material lore \n Toelken's conservative-dynamic continuum \n In the electronic age \n Notes \n Footnotes \n Overview \n To fully understand folklore it is helpful to clarify its component parts the terms \n folk \n and \n lore \n It is well-documented that the term was coined in by the Englishman \n William Thoms \n He fabricated it to replace the contemporary terminology of \"popular antiquities\" or \"popular literature\" The second half of the compound word \n lore \n proves easier to define as its meaning has stayed relatively stable over the last two centuries Coming from Old English lr 'instruction ' and with German and Dutch cognates it is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group frequently passed along by word of mouth \n The concept of \n folk \n proves somewhat more elusive When Thoms first created this term \n folk \n applied only to rural frequently poor and illiterate peasants A more modern definition of \n folk \n is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions \"Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in \n American folklore \n or to a \n single family \n \" \n This expanded social definition of \n folk \n supports a broader view of the material i e the lore considered to be \n folklore artifacts \n These now include all \"things people make with words verbal lore things they make with their hands material lore and things they make with their actions customary lore \" \n Folklore is no longer circumscribed as being chronologically old or obsolete The folklorist studies the \n traditional \n artifacts of a social group and how they are transmitted \n Transmission \n is a vital part of the folklore process Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists For folklore is also a verb These \n folk artifacts \n continue to be passed along informally as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants The folk group is not individualistic it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community \"As new groups emerge new folklore is created surfers motorcyclists \n computer programmers \n \" \n In direct contrast to \n high culture \n where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law folklore is a function of shared identity within the social group \n Having identified folk artifacts the professional folklorist strives to understand the \n significance \n of these beliefs customs and objects for the group For these cultural units \n would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group That meaning can however shift and morph So \n Halloween \n of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages and even gives rise to its own set of \n urban legends \n independent of the historical celebration The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew Compare this to brushing your teeth also transmitted within a group which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition \n For tradition is initially remembered behavior Once it loses its practical purpose there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action This meaning is at the core of folkloristics the study of folklore \n With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group it is indeed all around us \n It does not have to be old or antiquated It continues to be created transmitted and in any group is used to differentiate between \"us\" and \"them\" \n Origin and development of folklore studies \n Folkloristics History of Folklore Studies \n Folklore began to distinguish itself as an autonomous discipline during the period of romantic nationalism in Europe A particular figure in this development was \n Johann Gottfried von Herder \n whose writings in the 1770s presented oral traditions as organic processes grounded in locale After the German states were invaded by Napoleonic France Herder's approach was adopted by many of his fellow Germans who systematized the recorded folk traditions and used them in their process of \n nation building \n This process was enthusiastically embraced by smaller nations like Finland Estonia and Hungary which were seeking political independence from their dominant neighbours \n Folklore as a field of study further developed among 19th century European scholars who were contrasting \n tradition \n with the newly developing \n modernity \n Its focus was the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations which were considered as residue and survivals of the past that continued to exist within the lower strata of society \n The \" \n Kinder- und Hausmrchen \n \" of the \n Brothers Grimm \n first published is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry of that time This interest in stories sayings and songs continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folkloristics with literature and mythology By the turn into the 20th century the number and sophistication of folklore studies and folklorists had grown both in Europe and North America Whereas European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogenous peasant populations in their regions the American folklorists led by \n Franz Boas \n and \n Ruth Benedict \n chose to consider \n Native American \n cultures in their research and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore This distinction aligned American folkloristics with \n cultural anthropology \n and \n ethnology \n using the same techniques of data collection in their field research This divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in Europe and the social sciences in America offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself \n The term \n Folkloristics \n along with its synonym \n Folklore Studies \n note \n gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the \n folklore artifacts \n themselves With the passage in of the American Folklife Preservation Act P L 94-201 \n passed by the U S Congress in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration in folkloristics in the United States came of age \n \" Folklife means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States familial ethnic occupational religious regional expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom belief technical skill language literature art architecture music play dance drama ritual pageantry handicraft these expressions are mainly learned orally by imitation or in performance and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction \" \n Added to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and \n cultural heritage \n of the United States this law also marks a shift in national awareness It gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection Paradoxically it is a unifying feature not something that separates the citizens of a country \"We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved but as a tremendous opportunity In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas a rich resource for Americans\" \n This diversity is celebrated annually at the \n Smithsonian Folklife Festival \n and many other \n folklife fests \n around the country \n Definition of folk \n The folk of the 19th century the social group identified in the \n original term \"folklore\" \n was characterized by being rural non-literate and poor They were the peasants living in the countryside in contrast to the urban populace of the cities Only toward the end of the century did the urban proletariat on the coattails of Marxist theory become included with the rural poor as folk The common feature in this expanded definition of folk was their identification as the underclass of society \n Moving forward into the 20th century in tandem with new thinking in the \n social sciences \n folklorists also revised and expanded their concept of the folk group By the 1960s it was understood that \n social groups \n i e folk groups were all around us each individual is enmeshed in a multitude of differing identities and their concomitant social groups The first group that each of us is born into is the family and each family has its own unique \n folklore \n As a child grows into an individual its identities also increase to include age language ethnicity occupation etc Each of these cohorts has its own folklore and as one folklorist points out this is \"not idle speculation Decades of fieldwork have demonstrated conclusively that these groups do have their own folklore \" \n In this modern understanding folklore is a function of shared identity within any social group \n This folklore can include jokes sayings and expected behavior in multiple variants always transmitted in an informal manner For the most part it will be learned by observation imitation repetition or correction by other group members This informal knowledge is used to confirm and re-inforce the identity of the group It can be used both internally within the group to express their common identity for example in an initiation ceremony for new members Or it can be used externally to differentiate the group from outsiders like a folkdance demonstration at a community festival Significant to folklorists here is that there are two opposing but equally valid ways to use this in the study of a group you can start with an identified group in order to explore its folklore or you can identify folklore items and use them to identify the social group \n Beginning in the 1960s a further expansion of the concept of folk began to unfold in folkloristics Individual researchers identified folk groups which had previously been overlooked and ignored One major example of this is found in an issue of \"The Journal of American Folklore\" published This edition is dedicated exclusively to articles on women's folklore with approaches that were not coming from a man's perspective \n note \n Other groups that were highlighted as part of this broadened understanding of the folk group were \n non-traditional families \n occupational groups and families that pursued production of folk items through multiple generations \n Genres the lore of folklore \n Individual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types material verbal or customary lore For the most part self-explanatory these categories include physical objects \n material folklore \n common sayings expressions stories and songs \n verbal folklore \n and beliefs and ways of doing things \n customary folklore \n There is also a fourth major subgenre defined for \n children's folklore \n and games \n childlore \n as the collection and interpretation of this fertile topic is peculiar to school yards and neighborhood streets \n Each of these genres and their subtypes is intended to organize and categorize the folklore artifacts they provide common vocabulary and consistent labeling for folklorists to communicate with each other \n That said each artifact is unique in fact one of the characteristics of all folklore artifacts is their variation within genres and types \n This is in direct contrast to manufactured goods where the goal in production is to create products which are identical and variations are considered mistakes It is however just this required variation that makes identification and classification of the defining features a challenge And while this classification is essential for the subject area of folkloristics it remains just labeling and adds little to an understanding of the traditional development and meaning of the artifacts themselves \n Necessary as they are genre classifications are misleading in their oversimplification of the subject area Folklore artifacts are never self-contained they do not stand in isolation but are particulars in the self-representation of a community Different genres are frequently combined with each other to mark an event \n So a birthday celebration might include a song or formulaic way of greeting the birthday child verbal presentation of a cake and wrapped presents material as well as customs to honor the individual such as sitting at the head of the table and blowing out the candles with a wish There might also be special games played at birthday parties which are not generally played at other times Adding to the complexity of the interpretation the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old even though they follow the same model For each artifact embodies a single variant of a performance in a given time and space The task of the folklorist becomes to identify within this surfeit of variables the constants and the expressed meaning that shimmer through all variations honoring of the individual within the circle of family and friends gifting to express their value and worth to the group and of course the festival food and drink as \n signifiers \n of the event \n Verbal tradition \n Hansel and Gretel \n Arthur Rackham \n The formal definition of verbal lore is words both written and oral which are \"spoken sung voiced forms of traditional utterance that show repetitive patterns \" \n Crucial here are the repetitive patterns Verbal lore is not just any conversation but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience For \n narrative types \n by definition have consistent structure and follow an existing model in their narrative form \n note \n As just one simple example in English the phrase \"An elephant walks into a bar\" instantaneously flags the following text as a \n joke \n It might be one you've already heard but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context This is folklore in action Another example is the child's song \n Old MacDonald Had a Farm \n where each performance is distinctive in the animals named their order and their sounds Songs such as this are used to express cultural values farms are important farmers are old and weather-beaten and teach children about different domesticated animals \n This is folklore in action \n Verbal folklore was the \n original folklore \n the artifacts defined by \n William Thoms \n as older oral cultural traditions of the rural populace In his published call for help in documenting antiquities Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries A system to organize and categorize them became necessary \n Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in This was later expanded into the \n AarneThompson classification system \n by \n Stith Thompson \n and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature As the number of classified oral artifacts grew similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions ethnic groups and epochs giving rise to the \n Historic-Geographic Method \n a methodology which dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century \n When William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate Over the past two centuries this belief has proven to be wrong folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups Some variants might have been captured in published collections but much of it is still transmitted orally and indeed continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate \n The story of \n Jahangir \n and \n Anarkali \n is popular folklore in the former territories of the \n Mughal Empire \n Below is listed a small sampling of types and examples of verbal lore \n Aloha \n Ballads \n Blessings \n Bluegrass \n Bremen Town Musicians \n Chants \n Charms \n Cinderella \n Conspiracy theories \n Country music \n Cowboy poetry \n Creation stories \n Curses \n English similes \n Epic poetry \n Fable \n Fairy tale \n Folk belief \n Folk etymologies \n Folk metaphors \n Folk poetry \n Folk music \n Folksongs \n

Taunts \n Toasts \n Tongue-twisters \n Urban legends \n Word games \n Yodeling \n Material culture \n Horse and \n sulky \n weathervane Smithsonian American Art Museum \n The genre of \n material culture \n includes all artifacts that you can touch hold live in or eat They are tangible objects with a physical presence intended for use either permanently or just at next meal Most of these folklore artifacts are single objects which have been created by hand for a specific purpose However folk artifacts can also be mass-produced such as dreidels or Christmas decorations These items continue to be considered folklore due to their long pre-industrial history and their customary use All of these material objects \"existed prior to and continue alongside mechanized industry They are transmitted across the generations and subject to the same forces of conservative tradition and individual variation\" \n that are found in all folk artifacts Of interest to folklorists are their physical form their method of manufacture or construction their pattern of use as well as the procurement of the raw materials \n The meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important Of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration \n Play media \n Traditional highlanders' pins hand-made by a goldsmith in \n Podhale \n Poland \n In Europe before the \n Industrial Revolution \n everything was made by hand While some folklorists of the 19th century wanted to secure the oral traditions of the rural folk before the populace became literate other folklorists sought to identify hand-crafted objects before their production processes were lost to industrial manufacturing Just as verbal lore continues to be actively created and transmitted in today's culture so these \n handicrafts \n possibly with a shift in purpose and meaning can still be found all around us For there are many reasons to continue to hand make objects for use It could mean these skills are needed to repair manufactured items Or perhaps a unique design is wanted which is not or cannot be found in the stores Many crafts are considered to be simple home maintenance such as cooking sewing and carpentry Handicrafts have also become for many an enjoyable and satisfying hobby Last but not least handmade objects have taken on the sheen of prestige where extra time and thought is spent in their creation and their uniqueness is valued \n For the folklorist these hand-crafted objects embody multifaceted relationships in the lives of the craftsmen and the users which is completely lacking in mass-produced items without connection to an individual craftsman \n Regardless of the motivation for the handicraft this is folklore in action \n Many traditional crafts have been elevated to the \n fine \n or \n applied arts \n and taught in art schools such as ironworking and glass-making \n Or they are repurposed as \n folk art \n characterized as objects in which the decorative form supersedes its utilitarian needs Folk art is found in hex signs on Pennsylvania Dutch barns tin man sculptures made by metalworkers front yard Christmas displays decorated school lockers carved gun stocks and tattoos \"Words such as naive self-taught and individualistic are used to describe these objects and the exceptional rather than the representative creation is featured \" \n This is in contrast to our understanding of folklore artifacts which are nurtured and passed along in community \n note \n Many objects of material folklore big and small are challenging to classify difficult to archive and unwieldy to store How do we preserve these bulky artifacts of material culture and how do we use them? That is the assigned task of museums Toward this goal the concept of the \n Living history \n or open-air museum has been developed beginning in Scandinavia at the end of the 19th century These museums are here to teach not just display Actors show how items were used reenacting everyday living by people from all segments of society In order to achieve this these museums rely heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society Many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period These \n Living history museums \n are now found throughout the United States and the world as part of a thriving \n heritage industry \n This is folklore in action \n This list represents just a small sampling of objects and skills which are included in studies of material culture \n Autograph books \n Bunad \n Embroidery \n Folk art \n Folk costume \n Folk medicines \n Food recipes and presentation \n Foodways \n Common Handicrafts \n Handmade toys \n Haystacks \n Hex signs \n Decorative ironworks \n Pottery \n Quilting \n Stone sculpting \n Tipis \n Traditional Fences \n Vernacular architecture \n Weathervanes \n Woodworking \n Customs \n Customary culture \n is remembered enactment i e re-enactment It is the patterns of expected behavior within a group the \"traditional and expected way of doing things\" \n A custom can be a \n single gesture \n such as \n thumbs down \n or a \n handshake \n It can also be a complex interaction of multiple folk customs and artifacts as seen in a child's birthday party including verbal lore \n Happy Birthday song \n material lore presents and a birthday cake special games \n Musical chairs \n and individual customs making a wish as you blow out the candles Each of these is a folklore artifact in its own right potentially worthy of investigation and cultural analysis Together they combine to build the custom of a birthday party celebration a scripted combination of multiple artifacts which have meaning within their social group \n Santa Claus \n giving gifts to children a common folk practice associated with \n Christmas \n in Western nations \n Folklorists divide customs into several different categories \n A custom can be a \n seasonal celebration \n such as \n Thanksgiving \n or \n New Year's \n It can be a \n life cycle celebration \n for an individual such as baptism birthday or wedding A custom can also mark a \n community festival \n or event examples of this are \n Carnival in Cologne \n or \n Mardi Gras in New Orleans \n This category also includes the \n Smithsonian Folklife Festival \n celebrated each summer on the Mall in Washington DC A fourth category includes customs related to \n folk beliefs \n Walking under a ladder is just one of many \n symbols considered unlucky \n Occupational groups \n tend to have a rich history of customs related to their life and work so the \n traditions of sailors \n or \n lumberjacks \n note \n The area of \n ecclesiastical folklore \n which includes modes of worship not sanctioned by the established church \n tends to be so large and complex that it is usually treated as a specialized area of folk customs it requires considerable expertise in standard church ritual in order to adequately interpret folk customs and beliefs that originated in official church practice \n Customary folklore is by definition folklore in action it is always a performance be it a single gesture or a complex of scripted customs Participating in the custom either as performer or audience signifies acknowledgment of that social group Some customary behavior is intended to be performed and understood only within the group itself so the \n handkerchief code \n sometimes used in the gay community or the \n initiation rituals \n of the Freemasons Other customs are designed specifically to represent a social group to outsiders those who do not belong to this group The \n St Patrick's Day Parade \n in New York and in other communities across the continent is a single example of an ethnic group parading their separateness differential behavior \n and encouraging Americans of all stripes to show alliance to this colorful ethnic group Another multicolored social group the \n Gay Pride Movement \n also \n parades \n in communities across the country to show the strength of their culture and demonstrate for recognition of their group within the contemporary legal and social systems \n Practitioners of \n hoodening \n a folk custom found in \n Kent \n southeastern England in \n These festivals and parades with a target audience of people who do not belong to the social group intersect with the interests and mission of \n public folklorists \n who are engaged in the documentation preservation and presentation of traditional forms of folklife With a swell in popular interest in folk traditions these \n community celebrations \n are becoming more numerous throughout the western world While ostensibly parading the diversity of their community economic groups have discovered that these folk parades and festivals are good for business All shades of people are out on the streets eating drinking and spending This attracts support not only from the business community but also from federal and state organizations for these local street parties \n Paradoxically in parading diversity within the community these events have come to authenticate true community where business interests ally with the varied folk social groups to promote the interests of the community as a whole \n This is just a small sampling of types and examples of customary lore \n Amish \n Barn raising \n Birthday \n Cakewalk \n Cat's cradle \n Christmas \n Crossed fingers \n

the Elder \n shows five boys playing buck buck in the bottom right hand corner of the painting \n Childlore \n is a distinct branch of folklore that deals with activities passed on by children to other children away from the influence or supervision of an adult \n Children's folklore contains artifacts from all the standard folklore genres of verbal material and customary lore it is however the \n child-to-child conduit \n that distinguishes these artifacts For childhood is a social group where children teach learn and share their own traditions flourishing in a \n street culture \n outside the purview of adults This is also ideally where it needs to be collected as \n Iona and Peter Opie \n demonstrated in their pioneering book \n Children's Games in Street and Playground \n Here the social group of children is studied on its own terms not as an derivative of adult social groups It is shown that the \n culture of children \n is quite distinctive it is generally unnoticed by the sophisticated world of adults and quite as little affected by it \n Of particular interest to folklorists here is the mode of transmission of these artifacts this lore circulates exclusively within an informal pre-literate children's network or folkgroup It does not include artifacts taught to children by adults However children can take the taught and teach it further to other children turning it into childlore Or they can take the artifacts and turn them into something else so Old McDonald's farm is transformed from animal noises to the scatological version of animal poop This childlore is characterized by \"its lack of dependence on literary and fixed form Childrenoperate among themselves in a world of informal and oral communication unimpeded by the necessity of maintaining and transmitting information by written means \n This is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the 19th century \n As we have seen with the other genres the original collections of children's lore and games in the 19th century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out \n Early folklorists among them \n Alice Gomme \n in Britain and \n William Wells Newell \n in the United States felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost This fear proved to be unfounded In a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of \"Children's Games\" by \n Pieter Breugel the Elder \n we can see that the activity level is similar and many of the games from the painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today \n These same artifacts of childlore in innumerable variations also continue to serve the same function of learning and practicing skills needed for growth So bouncing and swinging rhythms and rhymes encourage development of \n balance and coordination \n in infants and children Verbal rhymes like \n Peter Piper picked \n serve to increase both the oral and aural acuity of children Songs and chants accessing a different part of the brain are used to memorize series \n Alphabet song \n They also provide the necessary beat to complex physical rhythms and movements be it hand-clapping jump roping or ball bouncing Furthermore many physical games are used to develop strength coordination and endurance of the players For some team games negotiations about the rules can run on longer than the game itself as social skills are rehearsed \n Even as we are just now uncovering the \n neuroscience \n that undergirds the developmental function of this childlore the artifacts themselves have been in play for centuries \n Below is listed just a small sampling of types and examples of childlore and games \n Buck buck \n Counting rhymes \n Dandling rhymes \n Finger and toe rhymes \n Counting-out games \n Dreidel \n Eeny meeny miny moe \n Games \n Traditional games \n London Bridge Is Falling Down \n Lullabies \n Nursery rhymes \n Playground songs \n Ball-bouncing rhymes \n Rhymes \n Riddles \n Ring a Ring o Roses \n Jump-rope rhymes \n Stickball \n Street games \n In action performance in context \n Lacking context the folklore artifacts in the \n Smithsonian Folklife Archive \n contain as much life as the stuffed elephant down the street in the Natural History Museum It is only in performance that they come alive as an active and meaningful component of a social group this is where the intergroup communication lives where transmission of these cultural elements takes place \"Folklore is folklore only when performed\" \n Without transmission these items are not folklore they are just individual quirky tales and objects \n This understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the 20th century when the two terms \" \n folklore performance \n \" and \"text and context\" dominated discussions among folklorists These terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive As borrowings from other fields of study one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore whereas context is used in discussions of material lore Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community \n The concept of cultural folklore performance is shared with \n ethnography \n and \n anthropology \n among other social sciences The cultural anthropologist \n Victor Turner \n identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance These are playfulness \n framing \n using symbolic language and employing the \n subjunctive mood \n In performance the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe \"what if\" That this fits well with all types of verbal lore where reality finds no footing among the symbols fantasies and nonsense of traditional tales proverbs and jokes is self-evident Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance \n Material culture requires some kneading to turn it into a performance Should we consider the performance of the production as in a quilting party or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed? Here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother quilting as a social event during the winter months or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event Each of these the traditional pattern chosen the social event and the gifting occur within the broader context of the community That said even in a discussion of context the structure and characteristics of performance can be recognized including an audience a framing event and the use of decorative figures and symbols which go beyond the utility of the object \n Backstory \n Before the Second World War folk artifacts had been understood and collected as cultural shards of an earlier time They were considered individual vestigial artifacts with little or no function in the contemporary culture Given this understanding the goal of the folklorist was to capture and document them before they disappeared They were collected with no supporting data bound in books archived and classified more or less successfully The \n Historic-Geographic Method \n worked to isolate and track these collected artifacts mostly verbal lore across space and time \n Following the Second World War folklorists began to articulate a more holistic approach toward their subject matter In tandem with the growing sophistication in the \n social sciences \n attention was no longer limited to the isolated artifact but extended to include the artifact embedded in an active cultural environment One early proponent was \n Alan Dundes \n with his essay \"Texture Text and Context\" first published \n A public presentation in by \n Dan Ben-Amos \n at the American Folklore Society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists In \n Richard Dorson \n called out the \"young Turks\" for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore This approach \"shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or 'text' to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication Conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists \" \n note \n Folklore became a verb an action something that people do not just something that they have \n It is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal direct communication either verbally or in demonstration Performance became the \n umbrella term \n for all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs \n Tradition-bearer and audience \n Play media \n Presentation of traditional Wallachian pipes at the \n Wallachian Open Air Museum \n Ronov pod Radhotm Czech Republic \n Transmission is a communicative process requiring a binary one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group Each of these is a defined role in the folklore process The tradition-bearer \n is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby or an Irish dance troupe performing at a local festival They are named individuals usually well known in the community as knowledgeable in their traditional lore They are not the anonymous \"folk\" the nameless mass without of history or individuality \n The audience of this performance is the other half in the transmission process they listen watch and remember Few of them will become active tradition-bearers many more will be passive tradition-bearers who maintain a memory of this specific traditional artifact in both its presentation and its content \n There is active communication between the audience and the performer The performer is presenting to the audience the audience in turn through its actions and reactions is actively communicating with the performer \n The purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists the performance is words and actions which are known recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience For folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior As members of the same cultural \n reference group \n they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge \n Dancing Hungarians \n Some elements of folk culture might be in the center of local culture and an import part of self-identity For instance \n folk dance \n is highly popular in \n Estonia \n and it has evolved into a sort of a national sport \n note \n XIX Estonian Dance Celebration in that was held together with \n Estonian Song Festival \n Framing the performance \n To initiate the performance there must be a \n frame \n of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance The frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations ex birthday or dance performances the framing occurs as part of the event frequently marked by location The audience goes to the event location to participate Games are defined primarily by rules \n it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed The folklorist Barre Toelken describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing \n string figure \n games with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other \n In verbal lore the performer will start and end with recognized linguistic formulas An easy example is seen in the common introduction to a joke \"Have you heard the one \" \"Joke of the day \" or \"An elephant walks into a bar\" Each of these signals to the listeners that the following is a \n joke \n not to be taken literally The joke is completed with the \n punch line \n of the joke Another traditional narrative marker in English is the framing of a fairy tale between the phrases \" \n Once upon a time \n \" and \"They all lived happily ever after \" Many languages have \n similar phrases \n which are used to frame a traditional tale Each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse and marks it as a recognized form of stylized formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience \n In the subjunctive voice \n Framing as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction verbal lore and not to be understood as historical fact or reality It moves the framed narration into the \n subjunctive mood \n and marks a space in which \"fiction history story tradition art teaching all exist within the narrated or performed expressive 'event' outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time \" \n This shift from the \n realis \n to the \n irrealis mood \n is understood by all participants within the reference group It enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group and can lead to very real consequences \n Anderson's law of auto-correction \n The theory of self-correction in folklore transmission was first articulated by the folklorist \n Walter Anderson \n in the 1920s this posits a feedback mechanism which would keep folklore variants closer to the original form \n note \n This theory addresses the question about how with multiple performers and multiple audiences the artifact maintains its identity across time and geography Anderson credited the audience with censoring narrators who deviated too far from the known traditional text \n Any performance is a two-way communication process The performer addresses the audience with words and actions the audience in turn actively responds to the performer If this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact they will respond with negative feedback Wanting to avoid more negative reaction the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations \"Social reward by an audience is a major factor in motivating narrators \" \n It is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance \n In reality this model is not so simplistic there is multiple redundancy in the active folklore process The performer has heard the tale multiple times he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions In turn he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience and they expect to hear the version they know This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate \n \"At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the 'virality' of meme transmission it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity of the artifact in certain features sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type \" \n Context of material lore \n For material folk artifacts it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of Alan Dundes text and context Here the text designates the physical artifact itself the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose The context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage Why was it made how was it made who will use it how will they use it where did the raw materials come from who designed it etc These questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer \n In his study of southeastern Kentucky chair makers Michael Owen Jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman \n For \n Henry Glassie \n in his study of Folk Housing in Middle Virginia \n the investigation concerns the historical pattern he finds repeated in the dwellings of this region the house is planted in the landscape just as the landscape completes itself with the house \n The artisan in his roadside stand or shop in the nearby town wants to make and display products which appeal to customers There is \"a craftsperson's eagerness to produce 'satisfactory items' due to a close personal contact with the customer and expectations to serve the customer again \" Here the role of consumer \" is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior \" \n In material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made chair used house and sold wares None of these artisans is \"anonymous\" folk they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community \n Toelken's conservative-dynamic continuum \n No two performances are identical The performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables He has given this performance one time more or less the audience is different the social and political environment has changed In the context of material culture no two hand-crafted items are identical Sometimes these deviations in the performance and the production are unintentional just part of the process But sometimes these deviations are intentional the performer or artisan want to play with the boundaries of expectation and add their own creative touch They perform within the tension of conserving the recognized form and adding innovation \n The folklorist Barre Toelken identifies this tension as \" a combination of both changing \"dynamic\" and static \"conservative\" elements that evolve and change through sharing communication and performance \" \n Over time the cultural context shifts and morphs new leaders new technologies new values new awareness As the context changes so must the artifact for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape they lose their meaning \n Joking \n as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as \n joke cycles \n come and go to reflect new issues of concern Once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context transmission becomes a nonstarter it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience If it is not transmitted then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic \n In the electronic age \n It is too soon to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts Just by looking at the development of one type of verbal lore \n electronic joking \n it is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process not killing it Jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission New communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations The fairy tale \n Snow White \n is now offered in \n multiple media forms \n for both children and adults including a television show a video game and a programming language \n A more generalized analysis of \n folklore in the electronic age \n will have to wait for further studies to be published in the field \n Folklore portal \n For a

\n happiness \n or \n welfare \n however \"human \n flourishing \n \" has been proposed as a more accurate translation \n Etymologically it consists of the words \" \n eu \n \" \"good\" and \" \n

\"excellence\" and \" \n phronesis \n \" often translated as \"practical or ethical wisdom\" \n In \n Aristotle \n 's works eudaimonia based on older Greek tradition was used as the term for the highest human good and so it is the aim of practical philosophy including \n ethics \n and \n political philosophy \n to consider and also experience what it really is and how it can be achieved \n Discussion of the links between virtue of character \n ethik aret \n and happiness \n eudaimonia \n is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics and a subject of much disagreement As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle \n and the \n Stoics \n Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health wealth and beauty By contrast the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods \n Definition \n Etymology and translation \n Main views on eudaimonia and its relation to aret \n Socrates \n Plato \n Aristotle \n Epicurus \n The Stoics \n \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" \n Modern psychology \n Further reading \n Definition \n The \n Definitions \n a dictionary of Greek philosophical terms attributed to \n Plato \n himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in \n the Academy \n provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia \"The good composed of all goods an ability which suffices for living well perfection in respect of virtue resources sufficient for a living creature \" \n In his \n Nicomachean Ethics \n 1095a1522 Aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well i e eudaimon \n Verbally there is a very general agreement for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is eudaimonia and identify living well and faring well with being happy but with regard to what eudaimonia is they differ and the many do not give the same account as the wise For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure wealth or honour 1095a17 \n So as Aristotle points out saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable and means living well is not saying very much Everyone wants to be eudaimon and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual's well being The really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well Aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings The candidates that he mentions are a life of pleasure a life of political activity and a philosophical life \n One important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy \"arete\" \" \n virtue \n \" Aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of \"virtuous activity in accordance with reason\" 1097b221098a20 And even \n Epicurus \n who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue So the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness aret is bound up with eudaimonia However they disagree on the way in which this is so We shall consider the main theories in a moment but first a warning about the proper translation of aret \n As already noted the Greek word aret is usually translated into English as \"virtue\" One problem with this is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense which is not always what the ancients had in mind For a Greek aret pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics for example physical beauty So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of virtue' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom courage and compassion The sense of virtue which aret connotes would include saying something like \"speed is a virtue in a horse\" or \"height is a virtue in a basketball player\" Doing anything well requires virtue and each characteristic activity such as carpentry flute playing etc has its own set of virtues The alternative translation \"excellence\" or \"a desirable quality\" might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently \n Positive Psychology defines Eudaimonia as a self-discovery perceived development of one's best potentials a sense of purpose and meaning in life intense involvement in activities investment of significant effort and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive deep relationships \n Etymology and translation \n In terms of its etymology eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from \n eu \n meaning \"well\" and \n daimon \n daemon which refers to a minor deity or a guardian spirit \n Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach A literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity As this would be considered the most positive state to be in the word is often translated as 'happiness' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate or blessed Despite this etymology however discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance \n In his \n Nicomachean Ethics \n 1095a1522 \n Aristotle \n says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well' It is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well On the standard English translation this would be to say that \n happiness \n is doing well and living well' The word happiness' does not entirely capture the meaning of the Greek word One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind For example when we say that someone is \"a very happy person\" we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life We mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them In contrast eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia \n Eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence but quite independently of whether we do know about them Ascribing eudaimonia to a person then may include ascribing such things as being virtuous being loved and having good friends But these are all objective judgments about someone's life they concern a person's really being virtuous really being loved and really having fine friends This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out happy Conversely being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you and perhaps thought that they did not but it would count towards your eudaimonia So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not It includes conscious experiences of well being success and failure but also a whole lot more See Aristotle's discussion \n Nicomachean Ethics \n book \n Because of this discrepancy between the meaning of eudaimonia and happiness some alternative translations have been proposed W D Ross suggests \"well-being\" and John Cooper proposes \"flourishing\" These translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by \"happiness\" although each tends to raise some problems of its own In some modern texts therefore the other alternative is to leave the term in an English form of the original Greek as \"eudaimonia\" \n Main views on eudaimonia and its relation to aret \n Socrates \n French painter \n David \n portrayed the philosopher in \n The Death of Socrates \n What we know of \n Socrates \n ' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato's writings Scholars typically divide Plato's works into three periods the early middle and late periods They tend to agree also that Plato's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato's own views which go beyond those of Socrates appear for the first time in the middle works such as the \n Phaedo \n and the \n Republic \n This division will be employed here in dividing up the positions of Socrates and Plato on eudaimonia \n As with all other ancient ethical thinkers Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else see Plato \n Apology \n 30b \n Euthydemus \n 280d282d \n Meno \n 87d89a However Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism see above he seems to have thought that \n virtue \n is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia Socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control courage justice piety wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy eudaimon life Virtues guarantee a happy life eudaimonia For example in the \n Meno \n with respect to wisdom he says \"everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness\" \n Meno \n 88c \n In the \n Apology \n Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls \n Good Sir you are an Athenian a \n citizen \n of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth reputation and honors as possible while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul 29e \n it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for \n virtue \n 31ab italics added \n It emerges a bit further on that this concern for one's soul that one's soul might be in the best possible state amounts to acquiring moral virtue So Socrates' point that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue rather than pursuing honour or riches Virtues are states of the soul When a soul has been properly cared for and perfected it possesses the virtues Moreover according to Socrates this state of the soul moral virtue is the most important good The health of the soul is incomparably more important for eudaimonia than e g wealth and political power Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions This view is confirmed in the \n Crito \n where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul virtue is the most important good \n And is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits? Or do we think that part of us whatever it is that is concerned with justice and injustice is inferior to the body? Not at all It is much more valuable? Much more 47e48a \n Here Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing \n In summary Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight \n Plato \n Plato's great work of the middle period the \n Republic \n is devoted to answering a challenge made by the \n sophist \n Thrasymachus \n that conventional morality particularly the 'virtue' of justice actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia Thrasymachus's views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings in the \n Gorgias \n through the mouthpiece of Callicles The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice being just hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires This idea is vividly illustrated in book of the \n Republic \n when Glaucon taking up Thrasymachus' challenge recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges According to the myth Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring which when he turns it a particular way makes him invisible so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king marries his wife and takes over the throne The thrust of Glaucon's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of \n Nietzsche \n Throughout the rest of the \n Republic \n Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the \n virtue of justice \n is necessary for eudaimonia \n The School of Athens \n by \n Raffaello Sanzio \n showing \n Plato \n left and \n Aristotle \n right \n The argument of the \n Republic \n is lengthy and complex In brief Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious with all its parts functioning properly to the person's benefit In contrast Plato argues that the unjust man's soul without the virtues is chaotic and at war with itself so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia Plato's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue On Plato's version of the relationship virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia \n Aristotle \n Aristotle's account is articulated in the \n Nicomachean Ethics \n and the \n Eudemian Ethics \n In outline for Aristotle eudaimonia involves activity exhibiting virtue \n aret \n sometimes translated as excellence in accordance with \n reason \n This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle's \n essentialist \n understanding of \n human nature \n the view that \n reason \n logos \n sometimes translated as \n rationality \n is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work \n ergon \n of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason Basically well being eudaimonia is gained by proper development of one's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are \"the rational animal\" It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence \n aret \n in reason \n According to Aristotle eudaimonia actually requires \n activity \n action so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby Moreover he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions For example if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills one might say \"doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist\" From this it follows that eudaimonia living well consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason 1097b221098a20 Which is to say to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success The rest of the \n Nicomachean Ethics \n is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason Since reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character which enables a person to exercise his practical reason i e reason relating to action successfully \n Aristotle's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue However it is Aristotle's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche he does not ignore the importance of other goods' such as friends wealth and power in a life that is eudaimonic He doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as good birth good children and beauty' So a person who is hideously ugly or has \"lost children or good friends through death\" 1099b56 or who is isolated is unlikely to be eudaimon In this way \"dumb luck\" \n chance \n can preempt one's attainment of eudaimonia \n Epicurus \n Epicurus \n identified eudaimonia with the life of pleasure \n Epicurus \n ' ethical theory is \n hedonistic \n His view proved very influential on the founders and best proponents of \n utilitarianism \n Jeremy Bentham \n and \n John Stuart Mill \n Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the only intrinsic bad An object experience or state of affairs is intrinsically valuable if it is good simply because of what it is Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value An object experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable To see this consider the following example Suppose a person spends their days and nights in an office working at not entirely pleasant activities for the purpose of receiving money Someone asks them \"why do you want the money?\" and they answer \"So I can buy an apartment overlooking the ocean and a red sports car \" This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it in this case the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities \n Epicurus identifies the good life with the life of pleasure He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure and also freedom from pain and distress But it is important to notice that Epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure Rather he recommends a policy whereby pleasures are maximized \"in the long run\" In other words Epicurus claims that some pleasures are not worth having because they lead to greater pains and some pains are worthwhile when they lead to greater pleasures The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy \n Ancient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia where eudaimonia refers to an individual's well being Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue He believes that we do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure Epicurus' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous This thesisthe eudaimon life is the pleasurable lifeis not a \n tautology \n as \"eudaimonia is the good life\" would be rather it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in \n One important difference between Epicurus' eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness To this difference consider Aristotle's theory Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants and Epicurus would agree He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character See e g \n Nicomachean Ethics \n 1099a5 However Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia Rather eudaimonia is what we achieve assuming that we aren't particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods when we live according to the requirements of reason Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life By contrast Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life and being virtuous is not external goods aside identical with being eudaimon Rather according to Epicurus virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness So whereas Aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure Epicurus would endorse this claim \n The Stoics \n Zeno \n thought happiness was a \"good flow of life \" \n Stoic philosophy begins with \n Zeno of Citium \n c BC and was developed by \n Cleanthes \n BC and \n Chrysippus \n c 280c BC into a formidable systematic unity \n Zeno believed happiness was a \"good flow of life\" Cleanthes suggested it was \"living in agreement with nature\" and Chrysippus believed it was \"living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature\" \n Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism According to the Stoics virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato's earlier dialogues We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by \n virtue \n which has Christian connotations of charity patience and uprightness since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty However the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue which refers to the moral virtues However unlike Christian understandings of virtue righteousness or piety the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy forgiveness self-abasement i e the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God charity and self-sacrificial love though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice honesty moderation simplicity self-discipline resolve fortitude and courage states which Christianity also encourages \n The Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life Moral virtue is good and moral vice is bad and everything else such as health honour and riches are merely \"neutral\" \n The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia In this they are akin to \n Cynic \n philosophers such as \n Antisthenes \n and \n Diogenes \n in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances such as were recognized by Aristotle who thought that severe misfortune such as the death of one's family and friends could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of \n Immanuel Kant \n who argues that the possession of a \"good will\" is the only unconditional good One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral as neither good nor bad Kant's position seems to be that external goods are good but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness \n \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" \n Interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally enjoyed a revival in the twentieth century \n G E M Anscombe \n in her article \" \n Modern Moral Philosophy \n \" argued that \n duty \n -based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a \"law without a lawgiver\" \n She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the \n Ten Commandments \n depends on someone having made these rules \n Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients particularly Aristotle which ground morality in the interests and well being of human moral agents and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver \n Julia Driver \n in the \n Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \n explains \n Anscombe's article \n Modern Moral Philosophy \n stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism Kantian Ethics and Social Contract theories Her primary charge in the article is that as secular approaches to moral theory they are without foundation They use concepts such as \"morally ought\" \"morally obligated\" \"morally right\" and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of \n moral authority \n In the past God occupied that role but systems that dispense with God as part of the

Socratic \n schools The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure which meant not just the absence of pain as it did for \n Epicurus \n but positively enjoyable sensations Of these

history of the Cyrenaic school begins with \n Aristippus \n of Cyrene who was born around BCE He came to \n Athens \n as a young man and became a pupil of \n Socrates \n We have only limited knowledge of his movements after the \n execution of Socrates \n in BCE although he is said to have lived for a time in the court of \n Dionysius of Syracuse \n It is uncertain precisely which doctrines ascribed to the Cyrenaic school were formulated by Aristippus \n Diogenes Lartius \n based on the authority of \n Sotion \n and \n Panaetius \n provided a long list of books said to have been written by Aristippus However Diogenes also wrote that \n Sosicrates \n had stated that Aristippus had written nothing \n Among Aristippus' pupils was his daughter \n Arete of Cyrene \n who passed on his teachings to her own son \n Aristippus the Younger \n It was he according to \n Aristocles \n who turned the teachings of his grandfather into a comprehensive system \n At the least however it can be said that the foundations of Cyrenaic philosophy were ideas originated by the elder Aristippus \n After the time of the younger Aristippus the school broke up into different factions represented by \n Anniceris \n Hegesias \n and \n Theodorus \n who all developed rival interpretations of Cyrenaic doctrines many of which were responses to the new system of \n hedonistic philosophy \n laid down by \n Epicurus \n By the middle of the 3rd century BC the Cyrenaic school was obsolete \n Epicureanism \n had successfully beaten its Cyrenaic rivals by offering a system which was more sophisticated \n Philosophy \n The Cyrenaics were \n hedonists \n and held that pleasure was the supreme good in life especially physical pleasure which they thought more intense and more desirable than mental pleasures \n Pleasure is the only good in life and pain is the only evil \n Socrates \n had held that \n virtue \n was the only human good but he had also accepted a limited role for its utilitarian side allowing pleasure to be a secondary goal of moral action \n Aristippus and his followers seized upon this and made pleasure the sole final goal of life denying that virtue had any intrinsic value \n Epistemology \n The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical \n theory of knowledge \n They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth \n They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate \n sense-experiences \n for instance that I am having a sweet sensation now but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations for instance that the honey is sweet \n They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like \n All knowledge is of one's own immediate sensation These sensations are motions which are purely subjective and are painful indifferent or pleasant according as they are violent tranquil or gentle \n Further they are entirely individual and can in no way be described as being of the world objectively Feeling therefore is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct \n Our ways of being affected are alone knowable Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure \n Ethics \n Cyrenaicism deduces a single universal aim for all people which is pleasure Furthermore all feeling is momentary and homogeneous It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind \n Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures being more simple and more intense were preferable \n Momentary pleasure preferably of a physical kind is the only good for humans \n However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them otherwise pain will result and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life \n Regard should be paid to law and custom because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others \n Likewise friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide \n Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behavior Like many of the leading modern \n utilitarians \n they combined with their psychological distrust of popular judgments of right and wrong and their firm conviction that all such distinctions are based solely on law and convention the equally unwavering principle that the wise person who would pursue pleasure logically must abstain from that which is usually thought wrong or unjust This idea which occupies a prominent position in systems like those of \n Jeremy Bentham \n Volney \n and even \n William Paley \n was clearly of prime importance to the Cyrenaics \n Later Cyrenaics \n The later Cyrenaics \n Anniceris \n Hegesias \n and \n Theodorus \n all developed variations on the standard Cyrenaic doctrine For Anniceris pleasure is achieved through individual acts of gratification which are sought for the pleasure that they produce \n but Anniceris laid great emphasis on the love of family country friendship and gratitude which provide pleasure even when they demand sacrifice \n Hegesias believed that happiness is impossible to achieve \n and hence the goal of life becomes the avoidance of pain and sorrow \n Conventional values such as wealth poverty freedom and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain \n For Hegesias Cyrenaic hedonism was simply the least irrational strategy for dealing with the pains of life \n For Theodorus the goal of life is mental pleasure not bodily pleasure \n and he placed greater emphasis on the need for moderation and justice \n He was also famous for being an \n atheist \n To some extent these philosophers were all trying to meet the challenge laid down by \n Epicureanism \n and the success of \n Epicurus \n was in developing a system of philosophy which would prove to be more comprehensive and sophisticated than its rivals' \n The philosophy of the Cyrenaics around the time of \n Hegesias of Cyrene \n evolved in a way that has similarities with \n Skepticism \n Epicurianism \n and also \n Buddhism \n There are striking similarities with the tenets of \n Buddhism \n in particular the \n Four Noble Truths \n and the concept of \n Dukkha \n or \"suffering\" Coincidentally the rulers of \n Cyrene \n around the time Hegesias flourished the \n Ptolemaic \n king of \n Egypt \n Ptolemy II Philadelphus \n and from BC the independent king \n Magas of Cyrene \n are both claimed to have been recipients of \n Buddhist \n missionaries from the Indian king \n Ashoka \n according to the latter's \n Edicts \n It is therefore sometimes thought that Hegesias may have been directly influenced by Buddhist teachings through contacts with the alleged missionaries sent to his rulers in the 3rd century BC \n a \n Notes \n ^ \n \"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene nicknamed \n Peisithanatos \n \"The Death-Persuader\" was contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria His influence was such that he was ultimately prohited to teach\" Jean-Marie Lafont Les Dossiers d'Archologie \n INALCO \n Jean-Marie Guyau \n also paralleled his teachings to Buddhism \n Citations \n ^ \n Annas \n p

{"theme.id": 3, "title": "Psychological egoism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_hedonism", "depth": 1, "text": "Psychological egoism \n Redirected from \n Psychological hedonism \n For other forms of egoism see \n Egoism \n Psychological egoism \n is the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest even in what seem to be acts of \n altruism \n It claims that when people choose to help others they do so ultimately because of the personal benefits that they themselves expect to obtain directly or indirectly from doing so This is a \n descriptive \n rather than \n normative \n view since it only makes claims about how things are not how they ought to be It is however related to several other normative forms of egoism such as \n ethical egoism \n and \n rational egoism \n A specific form of psychological egoism is \n psychological hedonism \n the view that the ultimate motive for all voluntary human action is the desire to experience \n pleasure \n or to avoid \n pain \n Many discussions of psychological egoism focus on this type but the two are not the same theorists have explained behavior motivated by self-interest without using pleasure and pain as the \n final causes \n of behavior \n Psychological hedonism argues actions are caused by both a need for pleasure immediately and in the future However immediate gratification can be sacrificed for a chance of greater future pleasure \n Further humans are not motivated to strictly avoid pain and only pursue pleasure but instead humans will endure pain to achieve the greatest net pleasure Accordingly all actions are tools for increasing pleasure or decreasing pain even those defined as altruistic and those that do not cause an immediate change in satisfaction levels \n Foundations \n Contributions to modern psychology \n Psychoanalysis \n Behaviorism \n The debate \n The problem of apparent altruism \n Criticisms \n Explanatory power \n Circularity \n Evolutionary argument \n Notes \n Further reading \n Foundations \n Beginning with ancient philosophy \n Epicureanism \n claims humans live to maximize pleasure \n Epicurus \n argued the theory of human behavior being motivated by pleasure alone is evidenced from infancy to adulthood Humanity performs altruistic honorable and virtuous acts not for the sake of another or because of a moral code but rather to increase the well being of the self \n In modern philosophy \n Jeremy Bentham \n asserted like Epicurus that human behavior is governed by a need to increase pleasure and decrease pain \n Bentham explicitly described what types and qualities of pain and pleasure exist and how human motives are singularly explained using psychological hedonism Bentham attempted to quantify psychological hedonism Bentham endeavored to find the ideal human behavior based on \n hedonic calculus \n or the measurement of relative gains and losses in pain and pleasure to determine the most pleasurable action a human could choose in a situation \n From an evolutionary perspective \n Herbert Spencer \n a psychological egoist argued that all animals primarily seek to survive and protect their lineage Essentially the need for the individual and for the individual's immediate family to live supersedes the others' need to live \n All species attempt to maximize their own chances of survival and therefore well being Spencer asserted the best adapted creatures will have their pleasure levels outweigh their pain levels in their environments Thus pleasure meant an animal was fulfilling its egoist goal of self survival and pleasure would always be pursued because species constantly strive for survival \n Contributions to modern psychology \n Psychoanalysis \n Whether or not Sigmund Freud was a psychological egoist his concept of the \n pleasure principle \n borrowed much from psychological egoism and psychological hedonism in particular \n The pleasure principle rules the behavior of the \n Id \n which is an unconscious force driving humans to release tension from unfulfilled desires When Freud introduced \n Thanatos \n and its opposing force \n Eros \n the pleasure principle emanating from psychological hedonism became aligned with the Eros which drives a person to satiate sexual and reproductive desires \n Alternatively Thanatos seeks the cessation of pain through death and the end of the pursuit of pleasure thus a hedonism rules Thanatos but it centers on the complete avoidance of pain rather than psychological hedonist function which pursues pleasure and avoids pain Therefore Freud believed in qualitatively different hedonisms where the total avoidance of pain hedonism and the achievement of the greatest net pleasure hedonism are separate and associated with distinct functions and drives of the human psyche \n Although Eros and Thanatos are ruled by qualitatively different types of hedonism Eros remains under the rule of Jeremy Bentham's \n quantitative \n psychological hedonism because Eros seeks the greatest net pleasure \n Behaviorism \n Traditional \n behaviorism \n dictates all human behavior is explained by \n classical conditioning \n and \n operant conditioning \n Operant conditioning works through \n reinforcement \n and \n punishment \n which adds or removes pleasure and pain to manipulate behavior Using pleasure and pain to control behavior means behaviorists assumed the principles of psychological hedonism could be applied to predicting human behavior For example \n Thorndike's law of effect \n states that behaviors associated with pleasantness will be learned and those associated with pain will be extinguished \n Often behaviorist experiments using humans and animals are built around the assumption that subjects will pursue pleasure and avoid pain \n Although psychological hedonism is incorporated into the fundamental principles and experimental designs of behaviorism behaviorism itself explains and interprets only observable behavior and therefore does not theorize about the ultimate cause of human behavior Thus behaviorism uses but does not strictly support psychological hedonism over other understandings of the ultimate drive of human behavior \n The debate \n Psychological egoism is controversial Proponents cite evidence from introspection reflection on one's own actions may reveal their motives and intended results to be based on self-interest Psychological egoists and hedonists have found through numerous observations of natural human behavior that behavior can be manipulated through reward and punishment both of which have direct effects of pain and pleasure \n Also the work of some social scientists has \n empirically \n supported this theory \n Further they claim psychological egoism posits a theory that is a more \n parsimonious \n explanation than competing theories \n Opponents have argued that psychological egoism is not more parsimonious than other theories For example a theory that claims altruism occurs for the sake of altruism explains altruism with less complexity than the egoistic approach The psychological egoist asserts humans act altruistically for selfish reasons even when cost of the altruistic action is far outweighed by the reward of acting selfishly because altruism is performed to fulfill the desire of a person to act altruistically \n Other critics argue that it is false either because it is an over-simplified interpretation of behavior \n or that there exists empirical evidence of altruistic behaviour \n Recently some have argued that \n evolutionary theory \n provides evidence against it \n Critics have stated that proponents of psychological egoism often confuse the satisfaction of their own desires with the satisfaction of their own \n self-regarding \n desires Even though it is true that every human being seeks his own satisfaction this sometimes may only be achieved via the well-being of his neighbor An example of this situation could be phoning for an ambulance when a car accident has happened In this case the caller desires the well-being of the victim even though the desire itself is the caller's own \n To counter this critique psychological egoism asserts that all such desires for the well being of others are ultimately derived from self-interest For example German philosopher \n Friedrich Nietzsche \n was a psychological egoist for some of his career though he is said to have repudiated that later in his campaign against \n morality \n He argues in of \n The Dawn \n that in such cases compassionate impulses arise out of the projection of our identity unto the object of our feeling He gives some hypothetical examples as illustrations to his thesis that of a person feeling horrified after witnessing a personal feud coughing blood or that of the impulse felt to save a person who is drowning in the water In such cases according to Nietzsche there comes into play unconscious fears regarding our own safety The suffering of another person is felt as a threat to our own happiness and sense of safety because it reveals our own vulnerability to misfortunes and thus by relieving it one could also ameliorate those personal sentiments Essentially proponents argue that altruism is rooted in self-interest whereas opponents claim altruism occurs for altruism's sake or is caused by a non-selfish reason \n The problem of apparent altruism \n David Hume once wrote \"What interest can a fond mother have in view who loses her health by assiduous attendance on her sick child and afterwards languishes and dies of grief when freed by its death the child's from the slavery of that attendance?\" \n It seems incorrect to describe such a mother's goal as self-interested \n Psychological egoists however respond that helping others in such ways is ultimately motivated by some form of self-interest such as non-sensory satisfaction the expectation of reciprocation the desire to gain respect or reputation or by the expectation of a reward in a putative afterlife The helpful action is merely instrumental to these ultimately selfish goals \n In the ninth century \"Mohammed Ibn Al-Jahm \n Al-Barmaki \n \" has been quoted saying \n \"No one deserves thanks from another about something he has done for him or goodness he has done he is either willing to get a reward from God therefore he wanted to serve himself or he wanted to get a reward from people therefore he has done that to get profit for himself or to be mentioned and praised by people therefore to it is also for himself or due to his mercy and tenderheartedness so he has simply done that goodness to pacify these feelings and treat himself \" \n This sort of explanation appears to be close to the view of \n La Rochefoucauld \n and perhaps Hobbes \n According to psychological hedonism the ultimate egoistic motive is to gain good feelings of pleasure and avoid bad feelings of pain Other less restricted forms of psychological egoism may allow the ultimate goal of a person to include such things as avoiding punishments from oneself or others such as guilt or shame and attaining rewards such as \n pride \n self-worth power or reciprocal beneficial action \n Some psychologists explain \n empathy \n in terms of psychological hedonism According to the \"merge with others hypothesis\" empathy increases the more an individual feels like they are one with another person and decreases as the oneness decreases \n Therefore altruistic actions emanating from empathy and empathy itself are caused by making others' interests our own and the satisfaction of their desires becomes our own not just theirs Both \n cognitive \n studies and \n neuropsychological \n experiments have provided evidence for this theory as humans increase our oneness with others our empathy increases and as empathy increases our inclination to act altruistically increases \n Neuropsychological studies have linked \n mirror neurons \n to humans experiencing empathy Mirror neurons are activated both when a human or animal performs an action and when they observe another human or animal performs the same action Researchers have found that the more these mirror neurons fire the more human subjects report empathy From a neurological perspective scientists argue that when a human empathizes with another the brain operates as if the human is actually participating in the actions of the other person Thus when performing altruistic actions motivated by empathy humans experience someone else's pleasure of being helped Therefore in performing acts of altruism people act in their own self interests even at a neurological level \n Criticisms \n Explanatory power \n Even accepting the theory of universal positivity it is difficult to explain for example the actions of a soldier who sacrifices his life by jumping on a grenade in order to save his comrades In this case there is simply no time to experience positivity toward one's actions although a psychological egoist may argue that the soldier experiences moral positivity in knowing that he is sacrificing his life to ensure the survival of his comrades or that he is avoiding negativity associated with the thought of all his comrades dying \n Psychological egoists argue that although some actions may not clearly cause physical nor social positivity nor avoid negativity one's current contemplation or reactionary mental expectation of these is the main factor of the decision When a dog is first taught to sit it is given a biscuit This is repeated until finally the dog sits without requiring a biscuit Psychological egoists could claim that such actions which do not 'directly' result in positivity or reward are not dissimilar from the actions of the dog In this case the action sitting on command will have become a force of habit and breaking such a habit would result in mental discomfort This basic theory of conditioning behavior applied to other seemingly ineffective positive actions can be used to explain moral responses that are instantaneous and instinctive such as the soldier jumping on the grenade \n Circularity \n Psychological egoism has been accused of being \n circular \n \"If a person willingly performs an act that means he derives personal enjoyment from it therefore people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment \" In particular seemingly altruistic acts must be performed because people derive enjoyment from them and are therefore in reality egoistic This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment This objection was tendered by \n William Hazlitt \n and \n Thomas Macaulay \n in the 19th century and has been restated many times since An earlier version of the same objection was made by \n Joseph Butler \n in \n Joel Feinberg \n in his \n paper \"Psychological Egoism\" embraces a similar critique by drawing attention to the \n infinite regress \n of psychological egoism He expounds it in the following cross-examination \n \"All men desire only satisfaction \" \n \"Satisfaction of what?\" \n \"Satisfaction of their desires \" \n \"Their desires for what?\" \n \"Their desires for satisfaction \" \n \"Satisfaction of what?\" \n \"Their desires \" \n \"For what?\" \n \"For satisfaction\"etc \n ad infinitum \n Evolutionary argument \n In their book \n Unto Others \n Sober and Wilson detailed an evolutionary argument based on the likelihood for egoism to evolve under the pressures of \n natural selection \n Specifically they focus on the human behavior of parental care To set up their argument they propose two potential psychological mechanisms for this The hedonistic mechanism is based on a parent's ultimate desire for pleasure or the avoidance of pain and a belief that caring for its offspring will be instrumental to that The altruistic mechanism is based on an altruistic ultimate desire to care for its offspring \n Sober and Wilson argue that when evaluating the likelihood of a given trait to evolve three factors must be considered availability reliability and energetic efficiency The genes for a given trait must first be \n available \n in the gene pool for selection The trait must then \n reliably \n produce an increase in fitness for the organism The trait must also operate with \n energetic efficiency \n to not limit the fitness of the organism Sober and Wilson argue that there is neither reason to suppose that an altruistic mechanism should be any less available than a hedonistic one nor reason to suppose that the content of thoughts and desires hedonistic vs altruistic should impact energetic efficiency As availability and energetic efficiency are taken to be equivalent for both mechanisms it follows that the more reliable mechanism will then be the more likely mechanism \n For the hedonistic mechanism to produce the behavior of caring for offspring the parent must believe that the caring behavior will produce pleasure or avoidance of pain for the parent Sober and Wilson argue that the belief also must be true and constantly reinforced or it would not be likely enough to persist If the belief fails then the behavior is not produced The altruistic mechanism does not rely on belief therefore they argue that it would be less likely to fail than the alternative i e more reliable \n Academic careerism \n Acedia \n

the word view of things finds itself dismissed This applies to nearly all non-Western philosophies Oriental wisdom in particular but also sensualist empirical \n materialist \n nominalist \n hedonistic \n currents and everything that can be put under the heading of \"anti- \n Platonic \n philosophy\" Philosophy that comes down from the heavens is the kind that from Plato to \n Levinas \n by way of \n Kant \n and \n Christianity \n needs a world behind the scenes to understand explain and justify this world The other line of force rises from the earth because it is satisfied with the given world which is already so much \n \"His mission is to rehabilitate materialist and sensualist thinking and use it to re-examine our relationship to the world Approaching philosophy as a

\n In the atheist manifesto Onfray has said that among the \"incalculable number of contradictions and improbabilities in the body of the text of the synoptic Gospels\" \n two claims are made crucifixion victims were not laid to rest in tombs and in any case Jews were not crucified in this period Ancient Historian \n John Dickson \n of Macquarie University has said that \n Philo of Alexandria \n writing about the time of Jesus says that sometimes the Romans handed the bodies of crucifixion victims over to family members for proper burial The Roman Jewish historian \n Flavius Josephus \n even remarks \"the Jews are so careful about funeral rites that even malefactors who have been sentenced to crucifixion are taken down and buried before sunset\" \n Regarding the second claim Dickson calls this a \"clear historical blunder\" \n In his latest book \n Dcadence \n he argued for \n Christ myth theory \n which is a hypotheses that \n Jesus \n was not a historical person Onfrey based on the fact that other than in the New Testament Jesus is barely mentioned in accounts of the period \n The \n Universit Populaire \n Onfray was a high school philosophy teacher for two

other signal without the unpleasant experience \n Using paradise engineering human beings will be \"animated by gradients of genetically preprogrammed bliss orders of magnitude richer than anything physiologically accessible today \" \n A \n vegan \n Pearce argues that humans have a responsibility not only to avoid \n cruelty to animals \n within human society but also to redesign the global ecosystem so that animals do not suffer \n in the wild \n He has argued in favour of a \"cross-species global analogue of the \n welfare state \n \" \n suggesting that humanity might eventually

\"Libertine\" was originally coined by \n John Calvin \n to negatively describe opponents of his policies in Geneva Switzerland This group led by \n Ami Perrin \n argued against Calvin's \"insistence that church discipline should be enforced uniformly against all members of Genevan society\" \n Perrin and his allies were elected to the town council in and \"broadened their support base in \n Geneva \n by stirring up resentment among the older inhabitants against the increasing number of religious refugees who were fleeing France in even greater numbers\" \n By \n Calvinists \n were firmly in place on the Genevan town council so the Libertines led by Perrin responded with an \"attempted coup against the government and called for the massacre of the French This was the last great political challenge Calvin had to face in Geneva\" \n During the 18th and 19th centuries the term became more associated with debauchery \n Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand \n wrote that \n Joseph

by \n Pierre Choderlos de Laclos \n is a trenchant description of sexual libertinism \n Wayland Young \n argues \n the mere analysis of libertinism carried out by a novelist with such a prodigious

generally assumed to be a \n Hobbesian \n critique of \n rationalism \n The narrator subordinates reason to sense \n It is based to some extent on \n Boileau \n 's version of \n Juvenal \n 's eighth or fifteenth satire and is also indebted to Hobbes \n Montaigne \n Lucretius \n and \n Epicurus \n as well as the general libertine tradition \n Confusion has arisen in its interpretation as it is ambiguous as to whether the speaker is Rochester himself or a satirised persona \n It criticises the vanities and corruptions of the statesmen and politicians of the court of Charles II \n The \n libertine novel \n was an \n 18th century literary genre \n of which the roots lay in the European but mainly French libertine tradition The genre effectively ended with the \n French Revolution \n

Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists \n One or two positive reviews appeared such as the one in the \n Globe \n June \"The \n Liber Amoris \n is unique in the English language and as possibly the first book in its fervour its

Experimental studies \n Classical methods and results \n Although other fields have studied obedience social psychology has been primarily responsible for the advancement of research on obedience It has been studied experimentally in several different ways \n Milgram's experiment \n In one classical study Stanley Milgram as part of the \n Milgram experiment \n created a highly controversial yet often replicated study Like many other experiments in psychology Milgram's setup involved \n deception \n of the participants In the experiment subjects were told they were going to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning In reality the experiment focuses on people's willingness to obey malevolent authority Each subject served as a teacher of associations between arbitrary pairs of words After meeting the \"teacher\" at the beginning of the experiment the \"learner\" an accomplice of the experimenter sat in another room and could be heard but not seen Teachers were told to give the \"learner\" electric shocks of increasing severity for each wrong answer If subjects questioned the procedure the \"researcher\" again an accomplice of Milgram would encourage them to continue Subjects were told to ignore the agonized screams of the learner his desire to be untied and stop the experiment and his pleas that his life was at risk and that he suffered from a heart condition The experiment the \"researcher\" insisted had to go on The \n dependent variable \n in this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered \n Zimbardo's experiment \n The other classical study on obedience was conducted at \n Stanford University \n during the 1970s \n Phillip Zimbardo \n was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment In the \n Stanford Prison Experiment \n college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of \"social forces\" on participants behavior \n Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions here using \n random assignment \n half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing \"a psychological state of imprisonment\" \n Results \n The Milgram study found that most participants would obey orders even when obedience posed severe harm to others With encouragement from a perceived authority figure about two-thirds of the participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock to the learner This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that \"subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will\" \n Milgram attempted to explain how ordinary people were capable of performing potentially lethal acts against other human beings by suggesting that participants may have entered into an agentic state where they allowed the authority figure to take responsibility for their own actions \n Zimbardo obtained similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders and turned aggressive Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards The cruelty of the \"guards\" and the consequent stress of the \"prisoners \" forced Zimbardo to terminate the experiment prematurely after days \n Modern methods and results \n The previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience Milgram's study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community In a modern study Jerry Burger replicated Milgram's method with a few alterations Burger's method was identical to Milgram's except when the shocks reached volts participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended base condition To ensure the safety of the participants Burger added a two-step screening process this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment In the modeled refusal condition two confederates were used where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher The teacher stopped after going up to volts and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies' participants occurred after moving past volts Additionally since Milgram's study only used men Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions \n Using data from his previous study Burger probed participant's thoughts about obedience Participants' comments from the previous study were coded for the number of times they mentioned \"personal responsibility and the learner's well being\" \n The number of prods the participants used in the first experiment were also measured \n Another study that used a partial replication of Milgram's work changed the experimental setting In one of the Utrecht University studies on obedience participants were instructed to make a confederate who was taking an employment test feel uncomfortable Participants were told to make all of the instructed stress remarks to the confederate that ultimately made him fail in the experimental condition but in the control condition they were not told to make stressful remarks The dependent measurements were whether or not the participant made all of the stress remarks measuring absolute obedience and the number of stress remarks relative obedience \n Following the Utrecht studies another study used the stress remarks method to see how long participants would obey authority The dependent measures for this experiment were the number of stress remarks made and a separate measure of personality designed to measure individual differences \n Results \n Burger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time Additionally Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender In Burger's follow-up study he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue the more likely they were to stop the experiment The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task over 90% of them completed the experiment \n The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment called \"the foot in the door scenario\" \n In addition to the above studies additional research using participants from different cultures including Spain \n Australia \n and Jordan \n also found participants to be obedient \n Implications \n One of the major assumptions of obedience research is that the effect is caused only by the experimental conditions and \n Thomas Blass \n ' research contests this point as in some cases participant factors involving personality could potentially influence the results \n In one of Blass' reviews on obedience he found that participant's personalities can impact how they respond to authority \n as people that were high in authoritarian submission were more likely to obey \n He replicated this finding in his own research as in one of his experiments he found that when watching portions of the original Milgram studies on film participants placed less responsibility on those punishing the learner when they scored high on measures of authoritarianism \n In addition to personality factors participants who are resistant to obeying authority had high levels of \n social intelligence \n Other research \n Obedience can also be studied outside of the Milgram paradigm in fields such as economics or political science One economics study that compared obedience to a tax authority in the lab versus at home found that participants were much more likely to pay participation tax when confronted in the lab \n This finding implies that even outside of experimental settings people will forgo potential financial gain to obey authority \n Another study involving political science measured public opinion before and after a \n Supreme Court \n case debating whether or not states can legalize physician assisted suicide They found that participants' tendency to obey authorities was not as important to public opinion polling numbers as religious and moral beliefs \n Although prior research has demonstrated that the tendency to obey persists across settings this finding suggests that at personal factors like religion and morality can limit how much people obey authority \n In his TV film \n Pushed to the Edge \n British Mentalist and documentary director \n Derren Brown \n provides a striking informal \n confirmation \n of Milgram's main results The film shows that \"when confronted with authority our natural instinct is to unflinchingly obey without question to such an extent that even the most moral people can be made to commit the most horrendous acts simply because they are told to do so \" \n Similarly \n Brown's film \n The Heist \n replicated Milgram's procedure and obtained almost identical results 65% of the subjects followed the instructions of an authority figure and administered what they believed to be lethal \n electric shocks \n to another person \n Other experiments \n The Hofling hospital experiment \n Hofling hospital experiment \n Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in research settings In psychiatrist Charles K Hofling published the results of a \n field experiment \n on obedience in the nursephysician relationship in its natural hospital setting Nurses unaware they were taking part in an experiment were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a fictional drug to their patients Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances out of the nurses would have given the patient an overdose \n Cultural attitudes \n Doge's Palace \n in \n Venice \n capital featuring \n Virtues and vices \n - \n Obediencia D<omi>no exireo \n Obedience to God \n Many traditional cultures

schools \n exist to condition \n dogs \n to obey the orders of human owners \n Learning to obey adult rules is a major part of the \n socialization \n process in childhood and many techniques are used by adults to modify the behavior of children Additionally extensive training is given in armies to make soldiers capable of obeying orders in situations where an untrained person would not be willing to follow orders Soldiers are initially ordered to do seemingly trivial things such as picking up the sergeant's hat off the floor marching in just the right position or marching and standing in formation The orders gradually become more demanding until an order to the soldiers to place themselves into the midst of gunfire gets an instinctively obedient response \n Factors affecting obedience \n Embodiment of prestige or power \n Obedience occurs in several situations most often referred to is the obedience of soldiers to a superior officer \n When the Milgram experimenters were interviewing potential volunteers the participant selection process itself revealed several factors that affected obedience outside of the actual experiment \n Interviews for eligibility were conducted in an abandoned complex in \n Bridgeport \n Connecticut \n Despite the dilapidated state of the building the researchers found that the presence of a Yale professor as stipulated in the advertisement affected the number of people who obeyed This was not further researched to test obedience without a Yale professor because Milgram had not intentionally staged the interviews to discover factors that affected obedience \n A similar conclusion was reached in the \n Stanford prison experiment \n In the actual experiment \n prestige \n or the appearance of power was a direct factor in obedienceparticularly the presence of men dressed in gray \n laboratory coats \n which gave the impression of scholarship and achievement and was thought to be the main reason why people complied with administering what they thought was a painful or dangerous shock \n A similar conclusion was reached in the \n Stanford prison experiment \n Raj Persaud in an article in the BMJ \n comments on Milgram's attention to detail in his experiment \n The research was also conducted with amazing verve and subtletyfor example Milgram ensured that the \"experimenter\" wear a grey lab coat rather than a white one precisely because he did not want subjects to think that the \"experimenter\" was a medical doctor and thereby limit the implications of his findings to the power of physician authority \n Despite the fact that prestige is often thought of as a separate factor it is in fact merely a subset of power as a factor Thus the prestige conveyed by a Yale professor in a laboratory coat is only a manifestation of the experience and status associated with it and/or the social status afforded by such an image \n Agentic state and other factors \n According to Milgram \"the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person all of the essential features of obedience follow \" Thus \"the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter \" \n Besides this hypothetical agentic state Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject's obedience politeness awkwardness of withdrawal absorption in the technical aspects of the task the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human a belief that the experiment served a desirable end the sequential nature of the action and anxiety \n Belief perseverance \n Another explanation of Milgram's results invokes \n belief perseverance \n as the underlying cause What \"people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent Hence the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity as he merges his

some argue that security depends principally on developing protective and coercive capabilities in order to protect the security referent in a hostile environment and potentially to project that power into its environment and dominate it to the point of \n strategic supremacy \n Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships can develop partly by reducing antagonism between actors ensuring that fundamental needs can be met and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively \n Contexts of security examples \n The table shows some of the main domains where security concerns are prominent \n IT realm \n Communications security \n Computer security \n Internet security \n Application security \n Data security \n Information security \n Network security \n Endpoint security \n Physical realm \n Airport security \n Corporate security \n Food security \n Environmental security \n Home security \n Infrastructure security \n Physical security \n Port security \n / \n Supply chain security \n Transportation security \n Political \n National security \n Public security \n Homeland security \n Internal security \n International security \n Human security \n Monetary \n Economic security \n /financial security \n Social security \n The range of security contexts is illustrated by the following examples in alphabetical order \n Computer security \n Computer security \n Computer security \n also known as cybersecurity or IT security refers to the security of computing devices such as \n computers \n and smartphones as well as \n computer networks \n such as private and public networks and the \n Internet \n The field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies \n It concerns the protection of hardware software data people and also the procedures by which systems are accessed The means of computer security include the \n physical security \n of systems and \n security of information \n held on them \n Corporate security \n Corporate security \n Corporate security refers to the resilience of \n corporations \n against \n espionage \n theft damage and other threats The security of corporations has become more complex as reliance on IT systems has increased and their physical presence has become more highly distributed across several countries including environments that are or may rapidly become hostile to them \n Security checkpoint at the entrance to the \n Delta Air Lines \n corporate headquarters \n in \n Atlanta \n X-ray machines \n and \n metal detectors \n are used to control what is allowed to pass through an \n airport security \n perimeter \n Security checkpoint at the entrance to a \n shopping mall \n in \n Jakarta \n Indonesia \n Ecological security \n Environmental security \n Ecological security also known as environmental security refers to the integrity of \n ecosystems \n and the \n biosphere \n particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a \n diversity of life-forms \n including human life The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown \n Graffiti \n about \n ecological security \n Belarus \n Food security \n Food security \n Food security refers to the ready supply of and access to safe and \n nutritious \n food \n Food security is gaining in importance as the world's population has grown and productive land has diminished through overuse and \n climate change \n Climate change \n is affecting global \n agriculture \n and \n food security \n Home security \n Home security \n Home security normally refers to the security systems used on a property used as a dwelling commonly including doors locks alarm systems lighting fencing and personal security practices such as ensuring doors are locked alarms activated windows closed etc \n Security spikes protect a \n gated community \n in the \n East End of London \n Human security \n Human security \n Boys play among the bombed-out ruins of \n Gaza City \n Human security is the name of an emerging \n paradigm \n which in response to traditional emphasis on the right of nation states to protect themselves \n has focused on the primacy of the security of people individuals and communities \n The concept is supported by the \n United Nations General Assembly \n which has stressed \"the right of people to live in \n freedom \n and \n dignity \n \" and recognized \"that all individuals in particular vulnerable people are entitled to \n freedom from fear \n and \n freedom from want \n \" \n National security \n National security \n National security refers to the security of a \n nation state \n including its people economy and institutions In practice state governments rely on a wide range of means including \n diplomacy \n economic power \n and \n military capabilities \n Perceptions of security \n Since it is not possible to know with precision the extent to which something is 'secure' and a measure of vulnerability is unavoidable perceptions of security vary often greatly \n For example a fear of death by earthquake is common in the United States US but slipping on the bathroom floor kills more people \n and in France the United Kingdom and the US there are many fewer deaths by \n terrorism \n than there are women killed by their partners in the home \n Another problem of perception is the common assumption that the mere presence of a security system such as \n armed forces \n or \n antivirus software \n implies security For example two \n computer security \n programs installed on the same device can prevent each other from working properly while the user assumes that he or she benefits from twice the protection that only one program would afford \n Security theater \n is a critical term for measures that change perceptions of security without necessarily affecting security itself For example visual signs of security protections such as a home that advertises its alarm system may deter an \n intruder \n whether or not the system functions properly Similarly the \n increased presence of military personnel \n on the streets of a city after a \n terrorist attack \n may help to reassure the public whether or not it diminishes the risk of further attacks \n Security concepts examples \n Certain concepts recur throughout different fields of security \n Assurance \n - an expression of confidence that a security measure will perform as expected \n Countermeasure \n - a means of preventing an act or system from having its intended effect \n Defense in depth \n - a school of thought holding that a wider range of security measures will enhance security \n Exploit \n noun - a means of capitalising on a vulnerability in a security system usually a cybersecurity system \n Resilience \n - the degree to which a person community nation or system is able to resist adverse external forces \n Risk \n - a possible event which could lead to damage harm or loss \n Threat \n - a potential source of harm \n Vulnerability \n - the degree to which something may be changed usually in an unwanted manner by external forces \n Safety \n Security increase \n Security risk \n Peace"},
{"theme.id": 10, "title": "Social order", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order", "depth": 0, "text": "Social order \n The term \n social order \n can be used in two senses In the first sense it refers to a particular set or system of linked \n social structures \n institutions \n relations customs values and practices which conserve maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving Examples are the ancient the feudal and the capitalist social order In the second sense social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members The \n problem of order \n or \n Hobbesian problem \n which is central to much of \n sociology \n political science \n and \n political philosophy \n is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all \n Sociology \n Principle of extensiveness \n Groups and networks \n Status groups \n Values and norms \n Power and authority \n Spontaneous order \n Social honor \n Attainment \n Further reading \n Sociology \n Thomas Hobbes \n is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem to answer which he conceived the notion of a \n social contract \n Social theorists \n such as \n Karl Marx \n mile Durkheim \n Talcott Parsons \n and \n Jrgen Habermas \n have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of and what its real basis is For Marx it is the \n relations of production \n or economic structure which is the basis of a social order For \n Durkheim \n it is a set of shared social norms For Parsons it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation which again are based on a frame of cultural values For Habermas it is all of these as well as communicative action \n Principle of extensiveness \n Another key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a \n society \n the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole \n A good example of this is smaller religions based on the U S such as the \n Amish \n Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community \n Groups and networks \n In every society people belong to groups such as businesses families churches athletic groups or neighborhoods The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society There are \n networks \n and ties between groups as well as inside of each of the groups which create social order \n Some people belong to more than one group and this can sometimes cause conflict The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole and to promote pride within each group Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group enabling social norms and \n values \n to be reinforced \n Status groups \n \" \n Status groups \n \" can be based on a person's characteristics such as \n race \n ethnicity \n sexual orientation \n religion \n caste \n region \n occupation \n physical attractiveness \n gender \n education \n age etc They are defined as \"a subculture having a rather specific rank or status within the stratification system That is societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups some enjoying high ranking and some low \" \n One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a \n garbage man \n A certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups For example around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate \n Hanukkah \n while a Christian family may celebrate \n Christmas \n Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups \n Smaller groups exist inside of one status group For instance one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a \n social class \n based on financial ranking This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class For example a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed \n Values and norms \n Values can be defined as \"internal criteria for evaluation\" Values are also split into two categories there are individual values which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group we associate with friends family or co-workers Norms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation Unlike values norms are enforced externally or outside of oneself A society as a whole determines norms and they can be passed down from generation to generation \n Power and authority \n An exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is \n deviant behavior \n Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time For this reason it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from lack of \n social justice \n It is recognized that effective social justice and the need for authoritative \n social control \n are inversely related \n citation needed \n In societies those who hold positions of power and authority are among the \n upper class \n Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values Tension can form therefore between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that does not conform to the values of both classes \n Spontaneous order \n The order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems These systems being planned by more than one person may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare Considering this \n Thomas Schelling \n studied neighborhood racial segregation His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability but it does not always increase social order In his researching he found that \"when all individuals pursue their own preferences the outcome is segregation rather than integration \" as stated in \"Theories of Social Order\" edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne \n Social honor \n Social honor can also be referred to as social status It is considered the distribution of prestige or \"the approval respect admiration or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances\" The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable they respect or envy people that have more than they do When social honor is referred to as social status it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system Status can be achieved which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control such as race sex or parental social standing An example of \n ascribed status \n is \n Kate Middleton \n who married a prince An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire \n Attainment \n Two different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order The first theory is \"order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes \" as stated in \n Theories of Social Order \n by Hechter and Horne The next theory is that \"the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize \" also stated in \n Theories of Social Order \n by Hechter and Horne Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by \n Pierre Bourdieu \n who developed the idea of social orders ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields \n Sociology portal \n Conservatism portal \n

imply a moral quality as indicated by the \n aphorism \n \"cleanliness is next to \n godliness \n \" \n and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as ' \n health \n ' and ' \n beauty \n ' \n In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention the concept of cleanliness differs from \n purity \n which is a physical moral or ritual state of freedom from pollutants Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance cleanliness has a social dimension or implies a system of interactions \n \"Cleanliness \" observed \n Jacob Burckhardt \n \"is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection \" \n A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness but not ordinarily purity cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying \n On a practical level cleanliness is thus related to \n hygiene \n and \n disease \n prevention \n Washing \n is one way of achieving physical cleanliness usually with \n water \n and often some kind of \n soap \n or \n detergent \n Cleaning \n procedures are of the utmost importance in many forms of manufacturing \n As an

Cleanliness is linked with proper hygiene A person who is said to be clean usually depicts cleanliness \n Religion \n In Christianity \n In Hinduism \n In Islam \n Hygiene \n Industry \n Religion \n Ritual cleanliness \n In Christianity \n Main articles \n Ablution in Christianity \n and \n Lavabo \n The \n Bible \n has many rituals of purification relating to \n menstruation \n childbirth \n sexual relations \n skin disease \n death \n and \n animal sacrifices \n The \n Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church \n prescribes several kinds of \n hand washing \n for example after leaving the latrine lavatory or bathhouse or before prayer or after eating a meal \n The women in the \n Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church \n are prohibited from entering the church temple during \n menses \n and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives \n Christianity \n has always placed a strong emphasis on \n hygiene \n Despite the denunciation of the \n mixed bathing \n style of Roman pools by \n early Christian \n clergy as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men this did not stop the Church from urging its followers to go to public baths for bathing \n which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the \n Church Father \n Clement of Alexandria \n The Church also built \n public bathing \n facilities that were separate for both sexes near \n monasteries \n and pilgrimage sites also the \n popes \n situated baths within church \n basilicas \n and monasteries since the early Middle Ages \n Pope \n Gregory the Great \n urged his followers on value of \n bathing \n as a bodily need \n In Hinduism \n In \n Hinduism \n cleanliness is an important virtue and the \n Bhagavad Gita \n describes it as one of the divine qualities which one must practice The Sanskrit word for cleanliness is 'aucam' Interestingly the \n Bhagavad Gita \n repeats this word in five slokas at and \n rmad Bhgavatam \n mentioned 'aucam' at as one of the four legs of Satya Yuga or Golden Age as spiritual practice those who are addicted to sex life will not understand cleanliness purity of Atman 8-12 one of the thirty qualities to be acquired cleanliness as a characteristic of a Brahmin cleanliness is a quality of the best worker one should learn cleanliness to serve his or her Guru cleanliness is a natural quality of a Brahmin cleanliness as a virtue among those who has realised God quality to be practiced by a householder means of cleansing one body and mind 36-39 cleanliness means detachment from desire-prompted actions effects of Kali Yuga on cleanliness \n Srimad Bhagavatam \n also recognises cleanliness as one of the thirty qualities which one must acquire to obtain the grace of God \n and identifies internal and external cleanliness among the twelve regular duties \n Cleanliness is also an exalted quality which characterises the Satya Yuga Golden Age in Hinduism As stated by many Hindu scriptures that cleanliness is a way of relative to God \n deva-dvija-guru-prja-pjana aucam rjavam | brahmacaryam ahis ca rra tapa ucyate \n Service of the Devas gods holy men teachers parents and wise persons as also observance of cleanliness uprightness continence and non-injury - these constitute austerities pertaining to the body \n anapekha huchir dakha udsno gata-vyatha| sarvrambha-parityg yo mad-bhakta sa me priya \n Those who are indifferent to worldly gain externally and internally pure skillful without cares untroubled and free from selfishness in all undertakings such devotees of mine are very dear to me \n Cleanliness or aucam is both internal and external Hinduism extols not only external cleanliness but also internal cleanliness or purity Since their minds are constantly absorbed in the all-pure Lord devotees become internally cleansed from the defects of lust anger greed envy ego etc In this state of mind they naturally prefer to keep the external body and environment pure as well Thus in accordance with the old saying Cleanliness is next to Godliness they are also externally pure \n Cleanliness is also a virtue which has to be cultivated by Vedic students and spiritual aspirants \n Srimad Bhagavatam \n also explains the internal and external cleanliness as \n \"My dear Uddhava general cleanliness washing the hands bathing performing religious services at sunrise noon and sunset worshiping Me visiting holy places chanting japa avoiding that which is untouchable uneatable or not to be discussed and remembering My existence within all living entities as the Paramatman these principles should be followed by all members of society through regulation of the mind words and body \" \n All Hindus must make a visit to the seven sacred rivers Bathing in these rivers will purify the mind and increase their good merits Therefore to invoke the presence of the holy rivers the following Mantra is chanted before daily bath \n AUM gage ca yamune caiva godvar sarasvat | narmade sidhu kver jalesmin sanidhim kuru \n In this water I invoke the presence of holy waters from the rivers Ganga Yamuna Godavari Sarasvati Narmada Sindhu and Kaveri \n All

visiting a \n funeral \n is required as some \n hindus \n believe that it is an inauspicious thing to witness and the in-auspiciousness would follow This is also related to the pollution of the River Ganges \n Hindus also clean their homes particularly well in preparing to celebrate \n Diwali \n each year as they believe that it brings good \n luck \n Most \n Hindus \n also believe that keeping your house clean and great \n devotion \n are \n gestures \n to welcome the \n Goddess \n Lakshmi \n to their abode to stay Some orthodox Hindus refrain from cleaning their houses on a \n Friday \n as it is a day dedicated to \n Goddess \n Lakshmi \n and cleaning homes on that day is considered inauspicious so they are allowed to clean their homes on the rest of the days \n Tamil people \n also keep their homes clean in preparation for Diwali Pongal or Bhol \n Hinduism also gives a deeper meaning to cleanliness In \n Srimad Bhagavatam \n 36-39 cleanliness is also defined as detachment from activities prompted by desire Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment not merely to frequently rinse one's skin with water \n In Islam \n Muslim hygienical jurisprudence \n There are many verses in the Quran which discuss cleanliness For example Truly Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He 'loves those who keep themselves pure and clean And In mosque there are men who love to be clean and pure Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure \n First lessons in Islamic manuals of \n catechism \n are matters of cleanliness Subjects taught first in the book of cleanliness include which are clean what is clean and what is not clean what people need to be cleansed from how they should clean and which water should they use to clean \n Muslims \n are

Prayer \n Juma \n Ritual baths are recommended for spiritual purity also after committing a sin and are necessary for those who have washed a funeral Special attention is given to cleaning homes before the arrival of guests or before feasts \n Eid al-Fitr \n and \n Eid al-Adha \n and holy days and nights \n Hygiene \n Hygiene \n Since the \n germ theory of disease \n cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other \n hazardous materials \n A reaction to an excessive desire for a germ-free environment began to occur around when \n David Strachan \n put forth the \" \n

perspective \n social norms \n are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society \n Social psychology \n recognizes smaller group units such as a team or an office may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations \n In other words norms are regarded as collective representations of acceptable group conduct as well as individual perceptions of particular group conduct \n They can be viewed as cultural products including values customs and traditions \n which represent individuals' basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do \n Furthermore in the field of social psychology the roles of norms are emphasized which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as \"mental representations of appropriate behavior\" \n For example it has been shown that normative messages can promote pro-social behavior including decreasing alcohol use \n and increasing voter turnout \n and sustainability \n According to the psychological definition of social norms' behavioral component norms have two dimensions how much a behaviour is exhibited and how much the group approves of that behavior \n Both of these dimensions can be used in normative messages to alter norms and subsequently alter behaviors for example a message can target the former dimension by describing high levels of voter turnout in order to encourage more turnout At the same time norms also can be changed contingent on the observed behavior of others how much behavior is exhibited In fact in Sherif one confederate was able to affect the development of a group norm related to the autokinetic effect \n clarification needed \n Behavior \n Social control \n Sociology \n Emergence and transmission \n Transfer of norms between

Mathematical representations \n Return potential model \n Game theory \n Further reading \n Behavior \n Norms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society For example Crandall noted that certain groups e g \n cheerleading \n squads dance troupes sports teams sororities have a rate of \n bulimia \n a publicly recognized life-threatening disease that is much higher than society as a whole Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups \n Social control \n Although not considered to be formal laws within society norms still work to promote a great deal of \n social control \n They are statements that regulate conduct The cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances Ranging in variations depending on culture race religion and geographical location it is the foundation of the terms some know acceptable as not to injure others the golden rule and to keep promises that have been pledged \n Without them there would be a world without consensus common ground or restrictions Even though the law and a state's legislation is not intended to control social norms society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other This is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted For example the criminalisation of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives The language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships \n Social norms can be enforced formally e g through sanctions or informally e g through \n body language \n and non-verbal communication cues Because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership groups are said to control \n discretionary stimuli \n groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members' adherence to group norms effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning \n Social psychology \n research has found the more an individual values group-controlled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self the more likely he is to conform \n Social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival since they represent a codification of belief groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about \n Norms in every culture create \n conformity \n that allows for people to become \n socialized \n to the culture in which they live \n As social beings individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things to use certain words to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes and when it is not Thus knowledge about \n cultural \n norms is important for \n impressions \n which is an individual's regulation of their nonverbal behavior One also comes to know through experience what types of people he/she can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around Typically this knowledge is derived through experience i e social norms are learned through \n social interaction \n Wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the \n white collar work force \n Sociology \n For \n Talcott Parsons \n of the \n functionalist \n school norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters On the other hand \n Karl Marx \n believed that norms are used to promote the creation of \n roles \n in society which allows for people of different levels of \n social class \n structure to be able to function properly \n Marx claims that this power dynamic creates \n social order \n Heinrich Popitz \n is convinced that the establishment of social norms that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego solves the problem of \n contingency \n Niklas Luhmann \n In this way ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution social interaction is thus accelerated Important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions \n and social roles \n Emergence and transmission \n Rulemaking is one of the basic impulses humans have for organizing and simplifying actions Everyday there are new rules put into place as well as old rules that are more structured whether it be for a group or an individual Yet not only do humans make rules they strive on finding the rules that come eye to eye about how the world works \n These rules once accepted by an individual or a group after trial and error then become a norm \n Groups may adopt norms through a variety of ways Norms can arise formally where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations Laws or club rules serve as an example of this \n A large number of these norms we follow 'naturally' such as driving on the right side of the road in the US and on the left side in the UK or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket Many formal norms serve to provide safety to the general public \n However social norms are much more likely to develop informally emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior \n Not necessarily laws set in writing informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life \n These informal norms if broken may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions but instead encourage reprimands warnings or \n othering \n incest \n for example is generally thought of as wrong in society but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it \n Transfer of norms between groups \n Individuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group which can get adopted over time \n Without a clear indication of how to act people typically rely on their past history to determine the best course forward what was successful before may serve them well again In a group individuals may all import different histories or \n scripts \n about appropriate behaviors common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action usually with the integration of several members' schemas \n Under the importation paradigm norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly \n whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer \n Groups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behaviour within the group Once firmly established a norm becomes a part of the group's operational structure and hence more difficult to change While possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the group's norms values and perspectives rather than the other way around \n Deviance from social norms \n \"Normal is a bad word\" a graffito in \n Ljubljana \n Slovenia \n Deviance \n is defined as \"nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society \" \n More simply put if group members do not follow a norm they become labeled as a deviant In the sociological literature this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society Yet deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected Except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal Crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar Clifford R Shaw \n What is considered \"normal\" is relative to the location of the \n culture \n in which the \n social interaction \n is taking place In psychology an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the \"institutionalized deviant \" Similar to the sociological definition institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms At first group members may increase pressure on a non-conformist attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations The role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will effect others \n Especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individual's behavior back into line Over time however if a member continues to disobey the group will give up on him as a lost cause while the group may not necessarily revoke his membership they may give him only superficial consideration \n If a worker is late to a meeting for example violating the office norm of punctuality a boss or other co-worker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened If the behavior continues eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual \"is always late \" The group generalizes the individual's disobedience and promptly dismisses it thereby reducing the member's influence and footing in future group disagreements \n Group tolerance for deviation varies across membership not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations Individuals may build up a \"reserve\" of good behavior through \n conformity \n which they can borrow against later These \n idiosyncrasy credits \n provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations \n A teacher for example may more easily forgive a straight-A student for misbehavingwho has past \"good credit\" saved upthan a repeatedly disruptive student While past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits some group members have a higher balance to start with \n Individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group childhood movie stars for example who enroll in college may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen Finally \n leaders \n or individuals in other high-status positions may begin with more credits and be appear to be \"above the rules\" at times \n Even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless however while held to a more lenient standard than the average member leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme \n Deviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm One of those emotions can be widely attributed to guilt This emotion is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation Guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing \n It can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling Used in both instances it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of self-punishment Using the metaphor of \"dirty hands\" \n it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth It is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others Guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further \"honorable\" actions \n Operant conditioning \n The probability of these actions that are committed are coined to \n B F Skinner \n that states that \n operant conditioning \n plays a role in the process of social norm Operant conditioning is the increase that an action will occur again by increasing the reinforced response This process is that of reward and punishment or trial and error Hand in hand with deviance the consequences of ones behavior whether positive or negative will determine the probability of reoccurrence as well as the push towards regulating ones decisions in the future Containing five sub categories this conditioning treatment is an influence in the actions one commits and the feelings one experiences afterwards In the case of social deviance an individual who has gone against a norm will feel the negative connotation that comes with defying the conditioning that was taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement A perfect example is that of a little girl painting on the wall of the house as she seeks her mothers approval of her artistic work When the child witnesses the mother putting her in a \"time out\" she realizes that if she were to paint on the wall again it will lead to punishment therefore causing her to notice her negative reinforcement Which then makes the probability of her painting the wall again decrease immensely He also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in \n Built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us deviance is a frowned upon action \n Focus theory of normative conduct \n Cialdini \n Reno and Kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural situational or personal norms motivate action the researchers suggested the focus of an individuals attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow \n Types \n Descriptive versus injunctive \n Descriptive norms depict what happens while injunctive norms describe what \n should \n happen Cialdini Reno and Kallgren define a descriptive norm as people's perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations it signifies what most people do without assigning judgment The absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot for example transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not \n litter \n An Injunctive norm on the other hand transmits group approval about a particular behavior it dictates how an individual \n should \n behave \n Watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter \n Prescriptive and proscriptive \n Prescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do \n Expressing gratitude or writing a Thank You card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in American culture Proscriptive norms in contrast comprise the other end of the same spectrum they are similarly society's unwritten rules about what one should not do \n These norms can vary between cultures while an acceptable greeting in some European countries kissing a stranger on the cheek constitutes a proscriptive norm in the United States \n Subjective \n Subjective norm is determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want them to perform a behavior Social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform or not to perform a behavior \n Mathematical representations \n Over the last few decades several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view By quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform The return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes Under these theoretical frameworks choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate quantifiable decision \n Return potential model \n Figure The return potential model reproduced from Jackson \n Developed in the 1960s the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms In the regular coordinate plane the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the X-axis label \n a \n in \n Figure \n while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the Y-axis \n b \n in Figure \n The graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm Theoretically one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action For example it may be the case that among first-year graduate students strong social norms around how many daily cups of coffee you drink exist If the return curve in Figure correctly displays the example social norm we can see that if someone drinks cups of coffee a day the group strongly disapproves The group does not approve of member behavior until someone hits four cups of coffee a day the graduate students as represented by the return curve find it excessive to drink more than seven cups however as the approval again dips below zero As exhibited by the coffee example the return potential model displays for each increment of behavior how much group approval one can anticipate \n Point of maximum return \n The point with the greatest y-coordinate is called the point of maximum return as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best \n While \n c \n in Figure is labeling the return curve in general the highlighted point just above it at X=6 represents the point of maximum return Extending our above example the point of maximum return for first-year graduate students would be cups of coffee they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups Any more or any fewer cups would decrease the approval \n Range of tolerable behavior \n Label \n d \n represents the range of tolerable behavior or the amount of action the group finds acceptable \n It encompasses all the positive area under the curve In Figure the range of tolerable behavior extends is as the group approves of all behavior from to and 7-4=3 Carrying over our coffee example again we can see that first-years only approve of having a limited number of cups of coffee between and more than cups or fewer than would fall outside the range of tolerable behavior Norms can have a narrower or wider range of tolerable behavior Typically a narrower range of behavior indicates a behavior with greater consequences to the group \n Intensity \n The intensity of the norm tells how much the group cares about the norm or how much group affect is at stake to be won or lost It is represented in the return potential model by the total amount of area subsumed by the curve regardless of whether the area is positive or negative \n A norm with low intensity would not vary far from the x-axis the amount of approval or disapproval for given behaviors would be closer to zero A high-intensity norm however would have more extreme approval ratings In Figure the intensity of the norm appears high as few behaviors invoke a rating of indifference \n Crystallization \n Finally norm crystallization refers to how much variance exists within the curve translated from the theoretical back to the actual norm it shows how much agreement exists between group members about the approval for a given amount of behavior \n It may be that some members believe the norm more central to group functioning than others A group norm like how many cups of coffee first years should drink would probably have low crystallization since a lot of individuals have varying beliefs about the appropriate amount of caffeine to imbibe in contrast the norm of not plagiarizing another student's work would likely have high crystallization as people uniformly agree on the behavior's unacceptability Showing the overall group norm the return potential model in Figure does not indicate the crystallization However a return potential model that plotted individual data points alongside the cumulative norm could demonstrate the variance and allow us to deduce crystallization \n Game theory \n Game theory \n Another general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the \n repeated game \n of game theory Rational choice a branch of game theory deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents \n A norm gives a person a \n rule of thumb \n for how they should behave However a \n rational \n person only acts according to the rule if it is optimal for them The situation can be described as follows A norm gives an \n expectation \n of how other people act in a given situation macro A person acts optimally given the expectation micro For a norm to be \n stable \n people's actions must reconstitute the expectation without change micro-macro feedback loop A set of such correct stable expectations is known as a \n Nash equilibrium \n Thus a stable norm must constitute a Nash equilibrium \n In the Nash equilibrium no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action \n Social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the Nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches \n From a game-theoretical point of view there are two \n explanations \n for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world One is the difference in games Different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values which may result in a difference in games The other is \n equilibrium selection \n not explicable by the game itself Equilibrium selection is closely related to \n coordination \n For a simple example driving is common throughout the world but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left see \n coordination game \n A framework called comparative \n institutional analysis \n is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social norms \n Psychology

that is generally thought of as the loss of \n self-awareness \n in \n groups \n although this is a matter of contention see \n below \n Sociologists also study the phenomenon of deindividuation but the level of analysis is somewhat different For the social psychologist the level of analysis is the individual in the context of a social situation As such social psychologists emphasize the role of internal psychological processes Other social sciences such as \n sociology \n are more concerned with broad social economic political and historical factors that influence events in a given \n society \n Overview \n Major theoretical approaches and history \n Classic theories \n Contemporary theories \n SIDE \n Major empirical discoveries \n Milgram \n Philip Zimbardo \n Philip Zimbardo \n Diener Fraser Beaman and Kelem \n Nadler A Goldberg M Jaffe Y \n Dodd D \n Reicher S Levine R M Gordijn E \n Lee E J \n Applications \n Controversies \n Overview \n Theories of deindividuation propose that it is a psychological state of decreased self-evaluation and decreased evaluation apprehension causing \n antinormative \n and \n disinhibited behavior \n Deindividuation theory seeks to provide an explanation for a variety of antinormative collective behavior such as violent \n crowds \n lynch mobs \n etc \n Deindividuation theory has also been applied to \n genocide \n and been posited as an explanation for antinormative behavior online and in \n computer-mediated communications \n Although generally analyzed in the context of negative behaviors such as mob violence and genocide deindividuation has also been found to play a role in positive behaviors and experiences There still exists some variation as to understanding the role of deindividuation in producing anti-normative behaviors as well as understanding how contextual cues affect the rules of the deindividuation construct \n Major theoretical approaches and history \n In contemporary \n social psychology \n deindividuation refers to a diminishing of one's sense of individuality that occurs with behavior disjointed from personal or social standards of conduct For example someone who is an \n anonymous \n member of a mob will be more likely to act violently toward a police officer than a known \n individual \n In one sense a deindividuated state may be considered appealing if someone is affected such that he or she feels free to behave impulsively without mind to potential consequences However deindividuation has also been linked to \"violent and \n anti-social behavior \n \" \n Classic theories \n Gustave Le Bon \n was an early explorer of this phenomenon as a function of crowds Le Bon introduced his crowd psychology theory in his publication \n The Crowd A study of the Popular Mind \n The French psychologist characterized his posited effect of crowd mentality whereby individual personalities become dominated by the collective mindset of the crowd Le Bon viewed crowd behavior as \"unanimous emotional and intellectually weak\" \n He theorized that a loss of \n personal responsibility \n in crowds leads to an inclination to behave primitively and hedonistically by the entire group This resulting mentality according to Le Bon belongs more to the collective than any individual so that individual traits are submerged The idea of a \"group mind\" is comparable to the shared autism theory which holds that individuals within a \n group \n may develop shared beliefs that have no basis in reality \" \n delusions \n \" Already Le Bon was tending toward the conception of deindividuation as a state brought on by a lowering of \n accountability \n resulting from a degree of \n anonymity \n due to membership within a crowd where attention is shifted from the self to the more stimulating external qualities of the \n group \n s action which may be extreme \n Essentially individuals of \n Le Bon's \n crowd are enslaved to the group's mindset and are capable of conducting the most \n violent \n and heroic acts Le Bon's group-level explanation of behavioral phenomena in crowds inspired further \n theories \n regarding collective psychology from \n Freud \n McDougall \n Blumer \n and \n Allport \n Festinger \n Pepitone and Newcomb revisited \n Le Bon's \n ideas in coining the term deindividuation to describe what happens when persons within a \n group \n are not treated as individuals \n According to these theorists whatever attracts each member to a particular group causes them to put more emphasis on the group than on individuals \n This unaccountability inside a group has the effect of \"reducing inner restraints and increasing behavior that is usually inhibited \" \n Festinger \n et al \n agreed with Le Bons perception of behavior in a crowd in the sense that they believed individuals do become submerged into the crowd leading to their reduced \n accountability \n However these relatively modern theorists distinguished deindividuation from crowd theory by reforming the idea that the loss of individuality within a crowd is replaced by the groups mindset Instead \n Festinger \n et al \n argued that the loss of individuality leads to loss of control over internal or moral constraints \n Alternatively R C Ziller argued that individuals are subject to deindividuation under more specific situational conditions For instance he suggested that under rewarding conditions individuals have the learned incentive to exhibit individualized qualities in order to absorb credit for themselves whereas under punishing conditions individuals have the learned tendency to become deindividuated through submergence into the group as a means of \n diffusing responsibility \n P G Zimbardo \n suggested \"the expression of normally inhibited behavior\" may have both positive and negative consequences He expanded the proposed realm of factors that contribute to deindividuation beyond \n anonymity \n and loss of \n personal responsibility \n to include \" \n arousal \n sensory overload \n a lack of contextual structure or \n predictability \n and altered consciousness due to drugs or alcohol \" \n as well as \"altered time perspectives and degree of involvement in group functioning\" Zimbardo postulated that these factors lead to \"loss of identity or loss of \n self-consciousness \n \" which result in unresponsiveness to external stimuli by the individual and the loss of \"cognitive control over motivations and emotions \" Consequently individuals reduce their compliance with good and bad sanctions held by influences outside the group \n Zimbardo was consistent with \n Festinger \n et al \n in his suggestion that loss of individuality leads to a loss of control causing affected persons to behave intensely and impulsively having let go of internal restraints However he developed this model by specifying the \"input variables\" situational factors that lead to this loss of individuality as well as the nature of behaviors that result emotional impulsive and regressive Zimbardo further developed existing deindividuation theory by suggesting these outcome behaviors are \"self-reinforcing\" and therefore difficult to cease Moreover Zimbardo did not restrict his application to group situations he also applied deindividuation theory to \"suicide murder and interpersonal hostility \" \n Contemporary theories \n In the late seventies \n Ed Diener \n began to express dissatisfaction with the current deindividuation hypothesis which he deemed invalid without specific focus on the psychological processes that yield a deindividuated state Not only was Zimbardo's model deficient in that respect but the role of his input variables in causing anti-normative behaviors was not uniform Consequently Diener took it upon himself to refine Zimbardo's model by specifying further the internal processes which lead to deindividuation In he argued that paying attention to one's personal values through self-awareness increases the ability of that person to self-regulate In a group context when attention is distributed outward in line with this model away from the self the individual loses the ability to plan his actions rationally and substitutes planned behaviors with a heightened responsiveness to environmental cues \n Thus according to Diener the reduction of self-awareness is the \"defining feature of deindividuation\" Diener proposed that the strict focus on anonymity as the primary factor of deindividuation had created an empirical obstacle calling for a redirection of empirical research on the topic \n While Diener was able to take the focus away from anonymity in the theoretical evolution of deindividuation he was unable to empirically clarify the function of reduced self-awareness in causing \n disinhibited \n behavior In response to this ambiguity Prentice-Dunn and Rogers extended Diener's model by distinguishing public self-awareness from private self-awareness Public self-awareness they theorized to be reduced by \"accountability cues \" like \n diffusion of responsibility \n or \n anonymity \n Such factors according to these theorists cause members of a crowd to lose a sense of consequences for their actions thus they worry less about being evaluated and do not anticipate punishment Private self-awareness where \n attention \n is shifted away from the self however was reduced by \"attentional cues \" e g group cohesiveness and physiological arousal This reduction leads to \"an internal deindividuated state\" comprising decreased private self-awareness and altered thinking as a natural by-product that causes \"decreased self-regulation and attention to internalized standards for appropriate behavior \" The \"differential self-awareness\" theorists suggested both forms of self-awareness could lead to \"antinormative and disinhibited behavior\" but only the decreased private self-awareness process was in their definition of deindividuation \n SIDE \n The most recent model of deindividuation the social identity model of deindividuation effects \n SIDE \n was developed by Russell Spears and Martin Lea in The SIDE model argues that deindividuation manipulations can have the effect of decreasing attention to individual characteristics and interpersonal differences within the group They outlined their model by explaining that \n social identity \n performance can fulfill two general functions \n Affirming \n conforming \n or strengthening individual or group identities \n Persuading \n audiences into adopting specific behaviors \n This model attempts to make sense of a range of deindividuation effects which were derived from situational factors such as group immersion \n anonymity \n and reduced identifiability Therefore deindividuation is the increased salience of a group identity that can result from the manipulation of such factors \n The \n SIDE \n model is in contrast to other deindividuation explanations which involve the reduced impact of the self Further explanations by Reicher and colleagues state that deindividuation manipulations affect norm endorsement through not only their impact on self-definition but also their influence on power relations between group members and their audience \n Classical and contemporary approaches agree on the main component of deindividuation theory that deindividuation leads to \"anti-normative and disinhibited behavior\" \n as seen in \n Dissociative identity disorder \n or split personalities \n Major empirical discoveries \n Milgram \n Stanley Milgram's study \n is a classic study of blind \n obedience \n however many aspects of this study explicitly illustrate characteristics of situations in which deindividuation is likely to occur Participants were taken into a room and sat in front of a board of fake controls They were then told by the experimenter that they were completing a task on learning and that they were to read a list of word pairs to the learner and then test the learner on accuracy The participant then read a word and four possible matches If the confederate got the match wrong they were to administer a shock which was not real unbeknownst to the participant from the fake control panel they were sitting in front of After each wrong answer the intensity of the shock increased The participant was instructed by the experimenter to continue to administer the shocks stating that it was their duty in the \n experiment \n As the voltage increased the confederate began to complain of pain yelled out discomfort and eventually screamed the pain was too much and sometimes they even began to bang on the wall At the greatest amount of voltage administered the confederate stopped speaking at all The results of the study showed that percent of experiment participants administered the experiments final and most severe 450-volt shock Only participant refused to administer shocks past the 300- volt level The participants covered by a veil of anonymity were able to be more aggressive in this situation than they possibly would have in a normal setting Additionally this is a classic example of diffusion of responsibility in that participants looked to an authority figure the experimenter instead of being self-aware of the pain they were causing or engaging in self-evaluation which may have caused them to adhere to \n societal norms \n Philip Zimbardo \n This study prompted Zimbardo to write his initial theory and model of deindividuation based on the results of his research In one study participants in the experimental condition were made to be anonymous by being issued large coats and hoods which largely concealed their identity These \n New York University \n women were dressed up like \n Ku Klux Klan \n members in groups of four In contrast the participants in the control condition wore normal clothes and name tags Each participant was brought into a room and given the task of shocking a confederate in another room at different levels of severity ranging from mild to dangerous similar to \n Stanley Milgrams study \n in Zimbardo noted that participants who were in the anonymous condition shocked the confederates longer which would have caused more pain in a real situation than those in the non-anonymous control group However a second study using soldiers was done which showed the exact opposite results When the soldiers were identifiable they shocked longer than the unidentifiable soldiers Zimbardo proposed that as a result of anonymity the soldiers may have felt isolated from their fellow soldiers These studies motivated Zimbardo to examine this deindividuation and \n aggression \n in a prison setting which is discussed in the next study listed \n Philip Zimbardo \n Now a more widely recognized study since the publication of his book \n The Lucifer Effect \n the \n Stanford Prison Experiment \n is infamous for its blatant display of \n aggression \n in deindividuated situations Zimbardo created a mock prison environment in the basement of \n Stanford University \n s psychology building in which he \n randomly assigned \n men to undertake the role of either guard or prisoner These men were specifically chosen because they had no abnormal personality traits e g \n narcissistic \n authoritarian \n antisocial \n etc The experiment originally planned to span over two weeks ended after only six days because of the sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards Zimbardo attributed this behavior to deindividuation due to immersion within the group and creation of a strong \n group dynamic \n Several elements added to the deindividuation of both guards and prisoners Prisoners were made to dress alike wearing stocking caps and hospital dressing gowns and also were identified only by a number assigned to them rather than by their name Guards were also given uniforms and reflective glasses which hid their faces The dress of guards and prisoners led to a type of \n anonymity \n on both sides because the individual identifying characteristics of the men were taken out of the equation Additionally the guards had the added element of \n diffusion of responsibility \n which gave them the opportunity to remove personal responsibility and place it on a higher power Several guards commented that they all believed that someone else would have stopped them if they were truly crossing the line so they continued with their behavior Zimbardo's prison study would have not been stopped if one of Zimbardo's graduate students Christina Maslach had not pointed it out to him \n Diener Fraser Beaman and Kelem \n In this classic study Diener and colleagues had a woman place a bowl of candy in her living room for trick-or-treaters An observer was placed out of sight from the children in order to record the behaviors of the trick-or-treaters In one condition the woman asked the children identification questions such as where they lived who their parents were what their name was etc In the other condition children were completely \n anonymous \n The observer also recorded whether children came individually or in a group In each condition the woman invited the children in claimed she had something in the kitchen she had to tend to so she had to leave the room and then instructed each child to take only one piece of candy The anonymous group condition far outnumbered the other conditions in terms of how many times they took more than one piece of candy In 60% of cases the anonymous group of children took more than one piece sometimes even the entire bowl of candy The anonymous individual and the identified group condition tied for second taking more than one piece of candy 20% of the time The condition which broke the rule the least amount of times was the identified individual condition which took more than one piece of candy only in 10% of cases \n Nadler A Goldberg M Jaffe Y \n This study by Nadler Goldberg and Jaffe measured the effects that deindividuating conditions \n anonymity \n vs identifiable had on two subject conditions self-differentiated vs undifferentiated individuals The self-differentiated individual is said to have definite boundaries between inner characteristics identified as self and the social environment In the undifferentiated individual such a distinction is less marked Subjects who were preselected as being self-differentiated or undifferentiated were observed under conditions of high or low anonymity Each subject was exposed to transgressions and donations made by confederates and then their own transgressive and \n prosocial \n actions were measured Also measures of verbal \n aggression \n directed toward the experimenter and measures of internal state of deindividuation were taken Major findings of the study \n Within the undifferentiated groups a greater frequency of subsequent subject transgressive behavior occurred in the anonymity more than in the identifiability conditions \n Undifferentiated individuals are affected by deindividuating circumstances and they tend to transgress more after observing the model in the experiment \n In terms of verbal \n aggression \n self-differentiated individuals' level of verbal aggression was equal under anonymity and identifiability conditions However undifferentiated individuals tended to model the confederates' aggression and were more verbally aggressive when anonymous than when identifiable \n The study found that undifferentiated individuals were less self-conscious and less inhibited in the anonymity condition \n Overall the study supports the hypothesis that deindividuating conditions cause behavioral changes in undifferentiated individuals but have relatively little effect on the behavior of self-differentiated individuals \n Dodd D \n Dodds experiment evaluates the association between deindividuation and anonymity Dodd measured his subjects by asking them what they would do within the realm of reality if their identity were kept anonymous and they would receive no repercussions The responses were grouped into four categories \n prosocial \n antisocial \n nonnormative and neutral Results of his study yielded that 36% of the responses were antisocial 19% nonnormative 36% neutral and only 9% prosocial The most frequent responses recorded were \n criminal acts \n This study on deindividuation exhibits the importance of situational factors in this case anonymity when reporting antisocial behavior Furthermore this study demonstrates that personal traits and characteristics are not much of predictor when predicting the behavior Overall this study is supportive of the concept of deindividuation as Dodd found that behavior changes from what would be normal of a certain individual to a behavior that is not representative of normal behavioral decisions \n Reicher S Levine R M Gordijn E \n Following the social models of identity proposed by deindividuation the study conducted by Reicher Levine and Gordijn expresses the strategic effects of visibility on the \n ingroup \n The experimenters suggest that increasing visibility amongst the in-group members subsequently increases their ability to support each other against the \n outgroup \n this also leads to an increase in the traits of the in-group that would normally be sanctioned by the out-group The study was based on the debate over whether fox hunting should or should not be banned The experimenters were mainly concerned with the participants that defined themselves as anti-hunting The participants involved thirty male and female students in the first year of their A-level psychology course located in a rural town in South West Englandthe mean age was years The study involved two separate sessions where the participants completed a pre-test and were assigned to the pro- or anti- hunting groups A spokesperson representing each view was brought in to discuss their opinions individually with each participant The pro-hunting group was taken to another room and did not take further part in the study For the in-group low-visibility condition part of the anti-hunting participants were taken to individual booths where they were not visible to others in the experiment The remaining anti-hunting participants who were categorized under the in-group high visibility condition were seated in a circle where each was visible to all throughout the experiment At this point both groups were shown a video After watching the video the participants were handed a questionnaire They were asked to write their names on the front so that the out-group spokesperson would be able to identify the authors of the questionnaire before discussing the comments individually To the experimenters surprise the experiment demonstrated the inverse of their hypothesis The study showed that more participants were more likely to express normative behaviors that are punishable by powerful out-group when they are visible to fellow members of the same in-group Experimenters also found that in-group participants actually expressed opposition to the roles imposed by the experimenters themselves Instead of just uniting against hunt some of the in-group participants resented being told that their group supported certain viewssome regarded themselves as moderate pro- or anti- hunters instead In this case the experimenters themselves triggered a response from the in-group which was later analyzed through follow up experiments \n Lee E J \n This study conducted by Lee investigates the effects of deindividuation on \n group polarization \n Group polarization refers to the finding that following group discussion individuals tend to endorse a more extreme position in the direction already favored by the group In Lees study subjects were either assigned to a deindividuation or individuation condition Next each subject answered questions and provided an argument about a given dilemma They were then shown their partners decisions and the subjects were asked to indicate how convincing and valid the overall arguments were In analyzing her results Lee came to several conclusions \n Group identification \n was positively correlated with \n group polarization \n She confirmed her \n hypothesis \n that the subjects would show stronger group identification and greater opinion polarization when deindividuated than when individuated \n Lee found that the more the participants identified with their partners the more positive their evaluations of the partners arguments were manifesting in-group favoritism \n Her findings suggest that both higher group identification and deindividuated subjects reported a significantly higher level of public-self-awareness \n Overall this study provides solid research for which the previous findings regarding deindividuation can be solidified The finding that deindividuation was associated with stronger group polarization and identification corresponds with the basis of deindividuation individuals that are more polarized and identified with a group will be more apt to act out of character and display anti-normative behavior \n Applications \n Deindividuation is the perceived loss of individuality and personal responsibility that can occur when someone participates as part of a group It can cause a person to be more likely to donate a large amount of money to charity but also cause them to be more likely to engage in mob violence \n There are many instances in which the effects of deindividuation can be seen in real-world instances Deindividuation can occur in as varied instances as in the police force the military the internet sports teams \n gangs \n cults \n and social organizations Although they may seem very different on the surface these groups share many traits that make them conducive to and even contingent on deindividuation All of the examples share the strong drive towards \n group cohesiveness \n Police officers soldiers and sports teams all wear uniforms that create a distinct in-group while eliminating the individual differences of personal style Men in the military are even required to shave their heads in order to better unify their appearance Although gangs cults and fraternities and sororities do not require the same degree of physical uniformity they also display this tendency towards unifying the exterior in order to unify their group For example gangs may have a symbol that they tattoo on their bodies in order to identify themselves as part of the in-group of their gang Members of \n fraternities and sororities \n often wear clothing marked with their letters so that they can quickly be identified as part of their specific group By reducing individual differences these various groups become more cohesive The cohesiveness of a group can make its members lose their sense of self in the overwhelming identity of the group For example a young man in the military might identify himself through a variety of individual constructs however while in uniform with a shaved head and dog tags around his neck he might suddenly only identify himself as a soldier Likewise a girl wearing the letters of her sorority on her shirt and standing in a crowd of her sorority sisters may feel less like herself and more like a Chi-Oh or Tridelt Physically normalized to the standards of their respective groups these various group members are all at risk to feel deindividuized They may begin to think of themselves as a mere part of the group and lose the awareness that they are an individual with the capacity to think and act completely separately from their group \n They could do things they might not usually do out of shyness individual morality self-consciousness or other factors Due to reduced feelings of accountability and increased feelings of \n group cohesion \n and \n conformity \n these group members could act in a manner of non-normative ways Deindividuation is a prevalent feature of the internet Deindividuation online has been thought to be responsible for a widespread willingness to illegally download software One researcher tested the hypothesis that Persons who prefer the anonymity and pseudonymity associated with interaction on the Internet are more likely to pirate software but found that neither anonymity nor pseudonymity predicted self-reported software piracy \n From buying drinks for an entire bar of strangers to committing violence as dire as murder or rape deindividuation can lead a variety of people to act in ways they may have thought impossible \n Controversies \n Questions have been raised about the \n external validity \n of deindividuation research As deindividuation has evolved as a theory some researchers feel that the theory has lost sight of the dynamic group intergroup context of \n collective behavior \n that it attempts to model \n Some propose that deindividuation effects may actually be a product of group norms crowd behavior is guided by norms that emerge in a specific context \n More generally it seems odd that while deindividuation theory argues that group immersion causes antinormative behavior research in \n social psychology \n has also shown that the presence of a group produces \n conformity \n to group norms and standards \n Certain experiments such as Milgrams \n obedience \n studies demonstrate conformity to the experimenters demands however the research paradigm in this experiment is very similar to some employ in deindividuation studies except the role of the experimenter is usually not taken into account in such instances \n A larger criticism is that our conception of the antinormative behaviors which deindividuation causes is based on social \n norms \n which is problematic because norms by nature are variable and situation specific \n For instance Johnson and Downing demonstrated that group behaviors vary greatly depending on the situation Participants who dressed in \n Ku Klux Klan \n robes shocked a research confederate more but participants dressed as nurses actually shocked less regardless of whether they were identifiable or anonymous They explained these results as a product of \n contextual cues \n namely the costumes \n This explanation runs counter to \n Zimbardos \n initial theory of deindividuation which states that deindividuation increases antinormative behavior regardless of external cues Researchers who examine deindividuation effects within the context of situational norms support a \n social identity model of deindividuation effects \n Psychology portal \n Sociology portal \n Groupshift \n Groupthink \n Social facilitation \n

Please be sure that the supposed source of the copyright violation is not itself a \n Wikipedia mirror \n August \n Positive Discipline \n or PD is a discipline model used by schools and in \n parenting \n that focuses on the positive points of behaviour based on the idea that there are no bad children just good and bad \n behaviors \n You can teach and reinforce the good behaviors while weaning the bad behaviors without \n hurting the child verbally \n or \n physically \n People engaging in positive discipline are not ignoring problems Rather they are actively involved in helping their child learn how to handle situations more appropriately while remaining calm friendly and respectful to the children themselves Positive discipline includes a number of different techniques that used in combination can lead to a more effective way for parents to manage their kids behaviour or for teachers to manage groups of students Some of these are listed below Positive Behavior Support PBS is a structured open-ended model that many parents and schools follow It promotes positive decision making teaching expectations to children early and encouraging positive behaviors \n Positive discipline contrasts with \n negative discipline \n Negative discipline may involve angry destructive or violent responses to inappropriate behavior In the terms used by psychology research positive discipline uses the full range of reinforcement and punishment options \n Positive reinforcement \n such as complimenting a good effort \n Negative reinforcement \n such as ignoring requests made in a whining tone of voice \n Positive punishment \n such as requiring a child to clean up a mess s/he made and \n Negative punishment \n such as removing a privilege in response to poor behavior \n However unlike negative discipline it does all of these things in a kind encouraging and firm manner The focus of positive discipline is to establish reasonable limits and guide children to take responsibility to stay within these limits or learn how to remedy the situation when they don't \n Parenting style \n Five criteria \n Main Techniques \n Preventive measures \n Using Gerunds \n Positive Recognition \n Other Techniques \n Evidence \n Studies \n Benefits \n The Positive Discipline \n Parenting and \n Classroom Management \n Model is based on the work of \n Alfred Adler \n and \n Rudolf Dreikurs \n Dr Adler first introduced the idea of parenting education to United States audiences in the 1920s He advocated treating children respectfully but also argued that spoiling and pampering children was not encouraging to them and resulted in social and behavioral problems The classroom techniques which were initially introduced in Vienna in the early 1920s were brought to the United States by Dr Dreikurs in the late 1930s Dreikurs and Adler refer to the kind and firm approach to teaching and parenting as \"democratic \" \n Many other authors have carried on the parenting and classroom work of Alfred Adler \n Jane Nelsen \n wrote and self-published \n Positive Discipline \n in In \n Positive Discipline \n was picked up by \n Ballantine \n now a subsidiary of \n Random House \n The latest edition was published by Ballantine in which includes of the criteria for Positive Discipline listed below Nelsen has since added the 5th criteria Nelsen also co-authored a series of Positive Discipline books with Lynn Lott \n Positive Discipline for Teenagers \n Positive Discipline A-Z \n and \n Positive Discipline in the Classroom \n with H Stephen Glenn \n Positive Discipline the First Three Years \n and \n Positive Discipline for Preschoolers \n were co-authored by Jane Nelsen Cheryl Erwin and Roslyn Duffy Cheryl Erwin co-authored with Jane Nelsen \n Positive Discipline for Single Parents \n and \n Positive Discipline for Stepfamilies \n The term positive discipline has become very popular Many parenting books and programs that claim to be positive discipline are based on the philosophy of \"behaviorism \" which is very different from the original Adlerian-based positive discipline Behaviorism promotes \"external\" locus of control Positive discipline promotes \"internal\" locus of control as indicated in the Five Criteria for Positive Discipline \n Parenting style \n Nelsen describes four basic \n parenting styles \n modified from \n Diana Baumrind \n 's parenting style \n Short-term Parenting \n Long-term parenting \n Controlling/Punitive/Rewarding \n Permissive/Overprotective/Rescuing \n Neglectful/Giving up on being a parent \n Kind and Firm \n Positive discipline is used to teach long-term parentingthe kind and firm parenting style \n Five criteria \n There are criteria for effective positive discipline \n Helps children feel a sense of connection Belonging and significance \n Is mutually respectful and encouraging Kind and firm at the same time \n Is effective long-term Considers what the children are thinking feeling learning and deciding about themselves and their world and what to do in the future to survive or to thrive \n Teaches important social and \n life skills \n Respect concern for others \n problem solving \n and cooperation as well as the skills to contribute to the home school or larger community \n Invites children to discover how capable they are Encourages the constructive use of personal power and autonomy \n Positive Discipline is distinct from \n positive behavior support \n PBS which is a form of child discipline often used by schools and community agencies to promote successful behavior as PBS includes some behavioristic elements such as positive reinforcement PBS focuses on \"measuring\" behaviors replacement behaviors a reduction of crisis intervention and teaching strategies for self-control \n Main Techniques \n Creating Rules - In her book titled \n Positive Discipline \n which is the main source for this type of \n behavior management \n Jane Nelsen emphasizes the importance of not only creating clear rules but of making them fair Any rule should be followed by the parent or teacher as much as possible as well as by the child An example she gave was that of having a \"black hole box\" where any items left out of place around the house would be deposited for the length of one week This applied to the belongings of the children as well as of the parents Furthermore the rules should be devised by the children with some direction from the authority figure and be agreed upon in a group meeting situation where everyone has equal power and input This makes the children responsible for following the rules which they themselves created When consequences are necessary they should be delivered in a kind but firm manner preserving the trust and mutual respect between the adult and the child \n Inspiring Intrinsic Motivation - The idea of doing away with both positive and negative reinforcement as much as possible is suggested as a way to inspire \n intrinsic motivation \n Intrinsic motivation is the motivation drawn from internal sources out of a sense of ethics or a desire to feel good about oneself This is in contrast with \n extrinsic motivation \n wherein motivation stems from a desire to avoid punishment or attain a reward This is what Positive Discipline seeks to avoid so that children learn to act correctly even when there will be no external reward or punishment for behavior \n Recognizing Needs - In Positive Discipline theory it is posited that when children misbehave they are displaying that a need of theirs is not being met Children have different developmental abilities depending on their age - see \n Maslow's hierarchy of needs \n In dealing with the misbehavior it is suggested that focusing on the unmet need rather than the behavior itself will have better results \n Understand the Meaning - Naomi Aldort author of \"Raising Our Children Raising Ourselves\" explains that inappropriate behaviour can be a child's way of getting attention they do not act out without a valid reason as they try to do the best that they can Once there is an understanding behind the behaviour the cause can be removed and no further emotional outbursts will come from the child \n Redirect Negative Behaviour - A child who hears the word \"No\" all the time will eventually start to ignore its meaning Dr Katharine C Kersey the author of \"The 101s A Guide to Positive Discipline \" recommends encouraging \n positive behaviour \n to replace misbehaviour Parents should be encouraged to redirect the child's behaviour into something positive for example if a child is acting out in a supermarket the child should be redirected into something creative or helpful such as picking out a typeof fruit to buy instead of acting out \n Conscious Discipline - Conscious discipline targets the brain to help children know exactly what the authoritative figure wants This includes talking to the children with phrases such as how does that make you feel? and I noticed you looked upset what happened? These phrases help the children understand that their parent/caretaker respect them and care about what they have to say When a parent/caretaker accuses the child of doing something without knowing exactly what happened this may cause a bad reaction within the emotional state of the child Getting the children to do what the parent/caretaker wants is a bit difficult being the children usually have minds of their own and are in their own little worlds If a child is doing an unsafe act the parent/caretaker should tell the child that said activity is unsafe and instead they should try an alternative activity that is safe and just about the same thing For example if the child is standing on a chair the parent/caretaker should tell the child standing on the chair is unsafe instead why dont you sit on the chair or stand on the floor This will tell the child exactly what the parent/caretaker wants \n citation needed \n original research? \n Preventive measures \n Part of using positive discipline is preventing situations in which negative behaviors can arise There are different techniques that teachers can use to prevent bad behaviors \n Students who \"misbehave\" are actually demonstrating \"mistaken\" behavior There are many reasons why a student may exhibit mistaken behavior i e lack of knowing appropriate behavior to feeling unwanted or unaccepted For students who simply do not know what appropriate behavior they should be exhibiting the teacher can teach the appropriate behavior For example a child who is fighting over a toy in a dramatic way should be approached by a teacher who should try and create a fair solution by encouraging the child's input and talking about their problems to avoid another argument \n For students who are feeling unwanted or unaccepted a positive relationship needs to develop between the teacher and student before ANY form of discipline will work \n Sanctions would be less needed if students have a strong connection with the adult in charge and knew that the teacher respected them Teachers need to know how to build these relationships Simply telling them to demonstrate respect and connection with students is not enough for some of them because they may also lack knowledge on how to do this \n citation needed \n original research? \n Teachers need to view each child as an account they must deposit positive experiences in the student before they make a withdraw from the child when discipline takes place Teachers can make deposits through praise special activities fun classroom jobs smiles and appropriate pats on the backs Some children have never experienced positive attention Children long for attention if they are not receiving positive attention they will exhibit behavior that will elicit negative attention \n citation needed \n original research? \n Teachers can recognize groups of students who would not work well together because they are friends or do not get along well and have them separated from the start prevent situations which will result in negative behaviour Some teachers employ the \"boy-girl-boy-girl\" method of lining or circling up which may be sexist or effective depending on your perspective in order to keep friend groups separate and to encourage the students to make new friends The physical arrangement of the classroom can affect classroom discipline and the effectiveness of instruction \n Another technique would be to be explicit with the rules and consequences for breaking those rules from the start If students have a clear understanding of the rules they will be more compliant when there are consequences for their behaviors later on A series of warnings is sometimes used before a harsher consequence is used detention \n time-out \n etc especially for smaller annoyances for example a student can get warnings for calling out rather than getting an immediate detention because a warning is usually effective enough Harsher consequences should come without warnings for more egregious behaviors hitting another student cursing deliberately disobeying a warning etc Teachers can feel justified that they have not \"pulled a fast one\" on students \n Students are more likely to follow the rules and expectations when they are clearly defined and defined early Many students need to know and understand what the negative behaviors are before they end up doing one by accident \n Involving the students when making the rules and discipline plans may help prevent some students from acting out It teaches the students responsibility and creates an awareness of what good versus bad behaviors are It also makes the student feel obligated and motivated to follow the rules because they were involved while they were created \n Using Gerunds \n Gerunds \n are words ending in \"ing\" It is believed that using gerunds can help reinforce the positive behavior another would like to see rather than attacking a bad behavior For example a teacher might see students running down the hall and calmly say \"walking\" rather than yell \"stop running\" in an agitated voice He might say \"gently\" an adverb instead of insisting \"calm down!\" \n citation needed \n original research? \n Positive Recognition \n This addition is an example of \"Behaviorism\" and is not part of the original Positive Discipline that does not advocate punishment or rewards Positive discipline includes rewarding good behavior as much as curtailing negative behaviors Some \"rewards\" can be verbal Some are actual gifts \n Instead of yelling at a student displaying negative behaviors a teacher/leader might recognize a student behaving well with a \"thank you Billy for joining the line\" or \"I like the way you helped Billy find his notebook \" Recognizing a positive behavior can bring a group's focus away from the students displaying negative behavior who might just be \"acting out\" for attention Seeing this students seeking attention might try displaying good behaviors to get the recognition of the leader \n One persons submits this as a reward method Students are given stamps in their planner if they do well in a lesson When they receive enough stamps from the same subject usually or the student has a \n credit \n When and credits have been awarded to a particular student that student receives a certificate If a student meets certain behavioural criteria they are rewarded with a trip at the \n end of term \n citation needed \n original research? \n Other rewards \n A special chain or necklace students pass from one to another for doing good deeds \n High fives and positive words \n Awards/achievements on the wall of the classroom or cafeteria \n Other Techniques \n If a student is causing a distraction during class a teacher might do something to gain the attention of the student without losing momentum of the lecture One technique is quietly placing a hand on the shoulder of the student while continuing to speak The student becomes aware that the teacher would like them to focus Another technique is to non-chalantly stand in-between two students talking to each other This causes a physical barrier to the conversation and alerts the students to the teacher's needs A third technique for a standing group is to gently move the student next to the teacher \n citation needed \n original research? \n A funny technique that requires a skilled PD practitioner is \"the grocery list look\" A gentler version of \"the evil eye\" this look is not happy or mad but focused The teacher looks at the student places her tongue on the tip of her mouth and thinks about a list of things to do not to the child! This focused look along with silence makes a student just uncomfortable enough to change behaviors not enough to make them feel embarrassed or scared as an \n evil eye \n might \n citation needed \n original research? \n Evidence \n Studies of implementation of Positive Discipline techniques have shown that Positive Discipline tools do produce significant results Research has proven that schools with a high suspension rate do not have a successful academic outcome \n A study of school-wide implementation of classroom meetings in a lower-income Sacramento CA \n elementary school \n over a four-year period showed that suspensions decreased from annually to annually vandalism decreased from episodes to and teachers reported improvement in classroom atmosphere behavior attitudes and academic performance Platt A study of parent and teacher education programs directed at parents and teachers of students with \"maladaptive\" behavior that implemented Positive Discipline tools showed a \n statistically significant \n improvement in the behavior of students in the program schools when compared to control schools Nelsen Smaller studies examining the effects of specific Positive Discipline tools have also shown positive results Browning Potter Esquivel Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that a students perception of being part of the school community being \"connected\" to school decreases the incidence of socially risky behavior such as \n emotional distress \n and \n suicidal thoughts \n / attempts cigarette alcohol and marijuana use violent behavior and increases academic performance Resnick et al Battistich Goodenow There is also significant evidence that teaching younger students social skills has a protective effect that lasts into adolescence Students that have been taught social skills are more likely to succeed in school and less likely to engage in problem behaviors Kellam et al Battistich \n Programs similar to Positive Discipline have been studied and shown to be effective in changing parent behavior In a study of Adlerian parent education classes for parents of teens Stanley found that parents did more problem solving with their teens and were less autocratic in decision making Positive Discipline teaches parents the skills to be both kind and firm at the same time Numerous studies show that teens who perceive their parents as both kind responsive and firm demanding are at lower risk for smoking use of marijuana use of alcohol or being violent and have a later onset of \n sexual activity \n Aquilino Baumrind Jackson et al Simons Morton et al Other studies have correlated the teens perception of parenting style kind and firm versus autocratic or permissive with improved academic performance Cohen Deslandes Dornbusch et al Lam \n Template Full citations needed \n Studies have shown that through the use of positive intervention programs \"designed specifically to address the personal and social factors that place some high school students at risk of drug abuse schools can reduce these young people's drug use and other unhealthy behaviors\" Eggert Nicholas Owen \n citation needed \n Use of such programs has shown improvement in academics and a decline in drug use across the board \n Studies \n Studies have shown \"that kids who are at high risk of dropping out of school and abusing drugs are more isolated and depressed and have more problems with anger\" says Dr Leona Eggert of the University of Washington in Seattle \"They are disconnected from school and family and are loosely connected with negative peers\" Eggert Nicholas Owen \n Overall implementing positive programs to deal with Positive Discipline will better the decision making process of teens and parents according to some researchers \n Benefits \n Better student-teacher relations Less teacher wasted energy/frustration Students recognize desirable positive behaviors rather than feel attacked \n Statistics show that each year close to one third of eighteen-year-olds do not finish high school Bridgeland Dilulio Morison Minority and low-income areas show even higher numbers percent of crimes committed in the United States are done by high school drop-outs In order to know how to intervene Civic Enterprises interviewed dropouts and asked them what they suggest be done to increase high school completion numbers Here is what they came up with 81% said there should be more opportunities for \"real-world\" learning 81% said \"better\" teachers 75% said smaller class numbers 70% said \"increasing supervision in schools\" 70% said greater opportunities for summer school and after-school programs 62% said \"more classroom discipline and 41% said to have someone available to talk about personal problems with Bridgeland Dilulio Morison Through use of Positive Discipline efforts are being made to prevent occurrences such as dropping out of school \n School punishment \n Compare with Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools \n Child discipline \n Assertive discipline \n Attachment parenting"},

desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors \n While the purpose of child discipline is to develop and entrench desirable social \n habits \n in children the ultimate goal is to foster sound judgement and \n morals \n so the child develops and maintains self-discipline throughout the rest of his/her life \n Because the values beliefs education customs and \n cultures \n of people vary so widely along with the age and temperament of the child methods of child discipline vary widely Child discipline is a topic that draws from a wide range of interested fields such as \n parenting \n the professional practice of \n behavior analysis \n developmental psychology \n social work \n and various \n religious perspectives \n In recent years advances in the understanding of \n attachment parenting \n have provided a new background of theoretical understanding and advanced clinical and practical understanding of the effectiveness and outcome of parenting methods \n In Western society there has been debate in recent years over the use of \n corporal punishment \n for \n children \n in general and increased attention to the concept of \"positive parenting\" where good behavior is encouraged and rewarded \n Medieval times \n Colonial times \n Biblical views \n Medieval views \n Influence of John Locke \n The twentieth century \n Conservative backlash \n Corporal punishment \n Cultural differences \n Parenting styles \n Non-physical discipline \n Time-outs \n Grounding \n Scolding \n Non-punitive discipline \n Essential aspects \n Methods \n Praise and rewards \n Natural consequences \n Internal discipline and democracy \n Further reading \n Historical research suggests that there has been a great deal of individual variation in methods of discipline over time \n Medieval times \n Nicholas Orme of the University of Exeter argues that children in medieval times were treated differently from adults in legal matters and the authorities were as troubled about violence to children as they were to adults In his article \"Childhood in Medieval England \" he states \"Corporal punishment was in use throughout society and probably also in homes although social commentators criticized parents for indulgence towards children rather than for harsh discipline \" Salvation was the main goal of discipline and parents were driven to ensure their children a place in heaven \n In one incident in early 14th-century London neighbors intervened when a cook and clerk were beating a boy carrying water A scuffle ensued and the child's tormentors were subdued The neighbors didn't even know the boy but they firmly stood up for him even when they were physically attacked and they stood by their actions when the cook and clerk later sued for damages \n Colonial times \n During colonial times in the United States parents were able to provide enjoyments for their children in the form of toys according to David Robinson writer for the \n Colonial Williamsburg Journal \n Robinson notes that even the Puritans permitted their young children to play freely Older children were expected to swiftly adopt adult chores and accountabilities to meet the strict necessities of daily life \n Harsh punishments for minor infractions were common Beatings and other forms of corporal punishment occurred regularly one legislator even suggested capital punishment for children's misbehavior \n Biblical views \n The \n Book of Proverbs \n mentions the importance of disciplining children as opposed to leaving them neglected or unruly in several verses Interpretation of these verses varies as do many passages from the Bible from literal to metaphorical The most often paraphrased is from Proverbs \"He that spareth his \n rod \n hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes \" \n King James Version \n Other passages that mention the 'rod' are Proverbs \"Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell \" and Proverbs \"The rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame \" \n Although the Bible's lessons have been paraphrased for hundreds of years the modern phrase \"Spare the rod and spoil the child \" was coined by \n Samuel Butler \n in \n Hudibras \n a \n mock heroic \n narrative poem \n published in The \n Contemporary English Version \n of Proverbs is 'If you love your children you will correct them if you don't love them you won't correct them' \n Medieval views \n Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks \n The primary guidelines followed by medieval parents in training their children were from the Bible Scolding was considered ineffectual and cursing a child was a terrible thing \n In general the use of corporal punishment was as a disciplinary action taken to shape behavior not a pervasive dispensing of beatings for no reason Corporal punishment was undoubtedly the norm The medieval world was a dangerous place and it could take harsh measures to prepare a child to live in it Pain was the medieval way of illustrating that actions had consequences \n Influence of John Locke \n In his \n Essay Concerning Human Understanding \n English \n physician \n and \n philosopher \n John Locke \n argued that the child resembled a blank tablet \n tabula rasa \n at birth and was not inherently full of \n sin \n In his \n Some Thoughts Concerning Education \n he suggested that the task of the parent was to build in the child the strong body and \n habits \n of mind that would allow the capacity of \n reason \n to develop and that \n parents \n could reward good behavior with their esteem and punish bad behavior with disgrace the withdrawal of parental approval and affection - as opposed to beatings \n The twentieth century \n In the early twentieth century child-rearing experts abandoned a romantic view of childhood and advocated formation of proper habits to discipline children A U S Children's Bureau pamphlet \n Infant Care \n urged a strict schedule and admonished parents not to play with their babies \n citation needed \n John B Watson \n 's \n Behaviorism \n argued that parents could train malleable children by rewarding good behavior and punishing bad and by following precise schedules for food sleep and other bodily functions \n citation needed \n Although such principles began to be rejected as early as the 1930s they were firmly renounced in the best-seller \n Baby and Child Care \n by pediatrician \n Benjamin Spock \n which told parents to trust their own instincts and to view the child as a reasonable friendly human being Dr Spock revised his first edition to urge more parent-centered discipline in but critics blamed his popular book for its permissive attitude during the youth rebellions of the 1960s and 1970s \n Conservative backlash \n Following the permissive trend of the 1960s and early 1970s American \n evangelical \n Christian \n James Dobson \n sought the return of a more conservative society and advocated \n spanking \n of children up to age eight \n Dobson's position is controversial As early as \n The New York Times \n stated that \"most child-care experts today disapprove of physical punishment \" \n Corporal punishment \n Corporal punishment in the home \n School corporal punishment in the United States \n Corporal punishment of minors in the United States \n Corporal punishment prohibited in schools only \n Corporal punishment not prohibited \n Legality of corporal punishment in Europe \n Corporal punishment prohibited in schools and the home \n Corporal punishment prohibited in schools only \n Corporal punishment not prohibited in schools or in the home \n In many cultures parents have historically had the right to spank their children when appropriate A retrospective study in New Zealand showed that physical punishment of children remained quite common in the 1970s and 1980s with 80% of the sample reporting some kind of corporal punishment from parents at some time during childhood Among this sample 29% reported being hit with an empty hand However 45% were hit with an object and 6% were subjected to serious physical abuse The study noted that abusive physical punishment tended to be given by fathers and often involved striking the child's head or torso instead of the buttocks or limbs \n Attitudes have changed in recent years and legislation in some countries particularly in continental Europe reflect an increased skepticism toward corporal punishment As of domestic corporal punishment had been outlawed in countries around the world most of them in Europe or Latin America beginning with Sweden in Thirty years after Sweden's ban official figures show that just percent of Swedish children are spanked or otherwise struck by their parents today More than percent of Swedish children were spanked prior to the ban \n The Swedish law does not actually lay down any legal punishment for smacking but requires social workers to support families with problems \n Even as corporal punishment became increasingly controversial in North America Britain Australia and much of the rest of the English-speaking world limited corporal punishment of children by their parents remained lawful in all states of the \n United States \n It was not until that \n Delaware \n became the first state to pass a statute defining \"physical injury\" to a child to include \"any impairment of physical condition or pain \" \n Cultural differences \n A number of authors have emphasized the importance of cultural differences in assessing disciplinary methods Baumrind argues that \"The cultural context critically determines the meaning and therefore the consequences of physical discipline \" Baumrind italics in original Polite emphasizes that the \"debate over whether or not to use corporal punishment rages in many ethnic communities \" Larzelare Baumrind and Polite assert that \"After ignoring decades of cultural differences in the effects of spanking these ARCHIVES studies and other studies in the past year have each found significantly different effects for African Americans than for non-Hispanic European Americans The effects of spanking in African American families are generally beneficial to children unless it is used excessively either in severity or in frequency \" Larzelere et al references to other articles omitted Our results confirm the serious differences of opinion on discipline even in a relatively homogenous ethnic community \n Parenting styles \n There are different \n parenting styles \n which parents use to discipline their children Four types have been identified authoritative parents authoritarian parents indulgent parents and indifferent parents \n Authoritative parents \n are parents who use warmth firm control and rational issue-oriented discipline in which emphasis is placed on the development of self-direction They place a high value on the development of autonomy and self-direction but assume the ultimate responsibility for their child's behavior \"You live under my roof you follow my rules!\" is a clich but one that parents may often find themselves speakingand it probably most closely mimics the authoritative parenting style \n Authoritarian parents \n are parents who use punitive absolute and forceful discipline and who place a premium on obedience and conformity If parents exhibit good emotional understanding and control children also learn to manage their own emotions and learn to understand others as well \n These parents believe it is their responsibility to provide for their children and that their children have no right to tell the parent how best to do this Adults are expected to know from experience what is really in the child's best interest and so adult views are allowed to take precedence over child desires Children are perceived to know what they want but not necessarily what is best for them \n Indulgent parents \n are parents who are characterized by responsiveness but low demandingness and who are mainly concerned with the child's happiness They behave in an accepting benign and somewhat more passive way in matters of discipline \n Indifferent parents \n are parents who are characterized by low levels of both responsiveness and demandingness They try to do whatever is necessary to minimize the time and energy they must devote to interacting with their child In extreme cases indifferent parents may be neglectful \n They ask very little of their children For instance they rarely assign their children chores They tend to be relatively uninvolved in their children's lives It's not that they don't love their children It's just that they believe their children should live their own lives as free of parental control as possible \n A fifth type of parenting style is connectedness \n Connected parents \n are parents who want to improve the way in which they connect with their children using an empathetic approach to challenging or even tumultuous relationships Using the 'CALM' technique by Jennifer Kolari parents recognize the importance of empathy and aspire to build capacity in their children in hopes of them becoming confident and emotionally resilient The CALM acronym stands for \n C \n onnect emotionally match the \n A \n ffect of the child \n L \n isten to what your child is saying and \n M \n irror their emotion back to show understanding \n Non-physical discipline \n Non-physical discipline consists of both punitive and non-punitive methods but does not include any forms of corporal punishment such as smacking or spanking The regular use of any single form of discipline becomes less effective when used too often a process \n psychologists \n call \n habituation \n Thus no single method is considered to be for exclusive use Non-Physical discipline is used in the concerted cultivation style of parenting that comes from the middle and upper class concerted cultivation is the method of parenting that includes heavy parental involvement and use reasoning and bargaining as disciplinary methods \n Time-outs \n Child time-out \n A common method of child discipline is sending the child away from the family or group after misbehavior Children may be told to stand in the corner \"corner time\" or may be sent to their rooms for a period of time A \n time-out \n involves isolating or separating a child for a few minutes and is intended to give an over-excited child time to calm down \n Time-out \n painting by \n Carl Larsson \n Alternatively time-outs have been recommended \n by whom? \n as a time for parents to separate feelings of anger toward the child for their behavior and to develop a plan for discipline \n When using time-outs as a discipline strategy individuals must also take into consideration the temperaments of the child if one decides to use time-outs If a child for example has a feisty temperament or a temperament that expresses emotion in a highly intense way then discipline strategies of using time-outs would be ineffective because of the clash of discipline strategy to the child's temperament trait \n If an individual decides to use the time-out with a child as a discipline strategy the individual must be unemotional and consistent with the undesired behavior Along with taking into consideration the child's temperament the length of the time-out needs to also depend on the age of the child For example the time-out should last one minute per year of the child's age so if the child is five years old the time-out should go no longer than five minutes \n Several experts do not recommend the use of time-out or any other form of \n punishment \n These authors include \n Thomas Gordon \n Alfie Kohn \n and \n Aletha Solter \n Grounding \n Grounding discipline technique \n Grounding is a form of discipline usually for older children preteens and teenagers that restricts their movement outside of the home such as visiting friends or using the car and they are not allowed to go anywhere but school and few required places Sometimes it is combined with the withdrawal of privileges for computer video games telephone or TV \n Scolding \n Scolding involves reproving or criticizing a child's negative behavior and/or actions \n Some research suggests that scolding is counter-productive because parental attention including negative attention tends to reinforce behavior \n Non-punitive discipline \n While punishments may be of limited value in consistently influencing rule-related behavior non-punitive discipline techniques have been found to have greater impact on children who have begun to master their native language \n Non-punitive discipline also known as empathic discipline and positive discipline is an approach to child-rearing that does not use any form of punishment It is about loving guidance and requires parents to have a strong relationship with their child so that the child responds to gentle guidance as opposed to threats and punishment According to Dr Laura Markham the most effective discipline strategy is to make sure your child wants to please you \n Non-punitive discipline also excludes systems of \"manipulative\" rewards Instead a child's behavior is shaped by \"democratic interaction\" and by deepening parent-child communication The reasoning behind it is that while punitive measures may stop the problem behavior in the short term by themselves they do not provide a learning opportunity that allows children the autonomy to change their own behavior \n Punishments such as time-outs may be seen as banishment and humiliation Consequences as a form of punishment are not recommended but natural consequences are considered to be possibly worthwhile learning experiences provided there is no risk of lasting harm \n Positive discipline is a general term that refers to both non-violent discipline and non-punitive discipline Criticizing discouraging creating obstacles and barriers blaming shaming using sarcastic or cruel humor or using physical punishment are some negative disciplinary methods used with young children Any parent may occasionally do any of these things but doing them more than once in a while may lead to low self-esteem becoming a permanent part of the child's personality \n Authors in this field include \n Aletha Solter \n Alfie Kohn \n Pam Leo \n Haim Ginott \n Thomas Gordon \n Lawrence J Cohen \n and \n John Gottman \n Essential aspects \n In the past harsh discipline has been the norm for families in society However research by psychologists has brought about new forms of effective discipline Positive discipline is based on minimizing the child's frustrations and misbehavior rather than giving punishments The main focus in this method is the \"Golden Rule\" treat others the way you want to be treated Parents follow this when disciplining their children because they believe that their point will reach the children more effectively rather than traditional discipline The foundation of this style of discipline is encouraging children to feel good about themselves and building the parent's relationship with the child so the child wants to please the parent In traditional discipline parents would instill fear in their child by using shame and humiliation to get their point across However studies show that this type of punishment ultimately causes the children to have more psychological problems in their adolescence and adulthood Physical and harsh punishment shows the child that violence and negative treatment is acceptable in some circumstances wheres positive discipline demonstrates the opposite In positive discipline the parents avoid negative treatment and focus on the importance of communication and showing unconditional love Feeling loved important and well liked has positive and negative effects on how a child perceives themselves The child will feel important if the child feels well liked and loved by a person \n Other important aspects are reasonable and age-appropriate expectations feeding healthy foods and providing enough rest giving clear instructions which may need to be repeated looking for the causes of any misbehavior and making adjustments and building routines Children are helped by knowing what is happening in their lives Having some predictability about their day without necessarily being regimental will help reduce frustration and misbehavior \n Not only are the children taught to be open-minded but the parents must demonstrate this as well \n Methods \n Praise and rewards \n Operant conditioning \n Simply giving the child spontaneous expressions of appreciation or acknowledgement when they are not misbehaving will act as a reinforcer for good behavior Focusing on good behavior versus bad behavior will encourage appropriate behavior in the given situation According to B F Skinner past behavior that is reinforced with praise is likely to repeat in the same or similar situation \n In operant conditioning schedules of reinforcement are an important component of the learning process When and how often we reinforce a behavior can have a dramatic impact on the strength and rate of the response A schedule of reinforcement is basically a rule stating which instances of a behavior will be reinforced In some case a behavior might be reinforced every time it occurs Sometimes a behavior might not be reinforced at all Either positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement might be used depending on the situation In both cases the goal of reinforcement is always to strengthen the behavior and increase the likelihood that it will occur again in the future In real-world settings behaviors are probably not going to be reinforced each and every time they occur For situations where you are purposely trying to train and reinforce an action such as in the classroom in sports or in animal training you might opt to follow a specific reinforcement schedule As you'll see below some schedules are best suited to certain types of training situations In some cases training might call for starting out with one schedule and switching to another once the desired behavior has been taught \n Example of operant conditioning \n Positive reinforcement \n Whenever he is being good cooperative solves things non-aggressively immediately reward those behaviors with praise attention goodies \n Punishment \n If acting aggressively give immediate undesired consequence send to corner say \"NO!\" and couple with response cost \n Response cost \n Most common would be \"time-out\" Removing sources of attention by placing in an environment without other people Careful This can become aversive punishment depending on how done To be response cost it can only simply be taking away a desirable thing not adding a negative one \n Negative reinforcement \n One example would be to couple negative reinforcement with response costafter some period of time in which he has acted cooperatively or calmly while in the absence of others can bring him back with others Thus taking away the isolation should reinforce the desired behavior being cooperative \n Extinction \n Simply ignoring behaviors should lead to extinction Note that initially when ignored can expect an initial increase in the behaviora very trying time in situations such as a child that is acting out \n It is common for children who are otherwise ignored by their parents to turn to misbehavior as a way of seeking attention \n An example is a child screaming for attention Parents often inadvertently reward the bad behavior by immediately giving them the attention thereby reinforcing it On the other hand parents may wait until the child calms down and speaks politely then reward the more polite behavior with the attention \n Natural consequences \n Operant conditioning \n Natural consequences involve children learning from their own mistakes In this method the parent's job is to teach the child which behaviors are inappropriate In order to do this parents should allow the child to make a mistake and let them experience the natural results from their behavior For instance if a child forgets to bring his lunch to school he will find himself hungry later Using natural consequences would be indicative of the theory of accomplishment of natural growth which is the parenting style of the working class and poor The accomplishment of natural growth focuses on separation between children and family Children are given directives and expected to carry them out without complaint or delay Children are responsible for themselves during their free time and the parent's main concern is caring for the children's physical needs \n In order for this method to be effective the parents cannot shield their child from harm or from getting in trouble They must allow for the mistake to occur in order for the child to learn the consequences For example a basic natural consequence is that if the child touches a hot pot he will get burned The consequence is usually immediate and the parent may have little control when protecting the child However the pain is the consequence of touching the pot which will teach the child to not do that again \n Internal discipline and democracy \n Main articles \n Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools \n and \n Sudbury Valley School \n Sudbury model \n democratic schools attended by children ages to claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike \n Furthermore they emphasize that much more important than the externals of order is the question of the sources of internal discipline how does an individual come to develop the inner strength and character that endows his life with order and coherence an independent person appropriate to a free republic of co-equal citizens capable of making decisions within a rational self-consistent frameworka person treating and being treated with respect? \n They affirm that the hallmark of the independent person is the ability to bear responsibility and since there is no way of teaching or training another person for self-sufficiency there is no technique for obtaining or transmitting these traits Hence the only way a person becomes responsible for himself is for him to be responsible for himself with no reservation or qualifications Thence the need to permit children at home and school freedom of choice freedom of action and freedom to bear the results of actionthe three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility \n Chastisement \n Behavior analysis of child development \n Blab school \n Blanket

and symptoms e g impulsivity disregard for others and social norms aggressive outbursts misconduct and oppositional behaviors disinhibited instinctual drives including risk taking behaviors and hypersexuality Disinhibition is a common symptom following brain injury or lesions particularly to the frontal lobe and primarily to the orbitofrontal cortex \n The neuropsychiatric sequelae following brain injuries could include diffuse cognitive impairment with more prominent deficits in the rate of information processing attention memory cognitive flexibility and problem solving Prominent impulsivity affective instability and disinhibition are seen frequently secondary to injury to frontal temporal and limbic areas In association with the typical cognitive deficits these sequelae characterize the frequently noted \"personality changes\" in TBI Traumatic Brain Injury patients Disinhibition syndromes in brain injuries and insults including brain tumors strokes and epilepsy range from mildly inappropriate social behavior lack of control over one's behaviour to the full-blown mania depending on the lesions to specific brain regions Several studies in brain traumas and insults have demonstrated significant associations between disinhibition syndromes and dysfunction of orbitofrontal and basotemporal cortices affecting visuospatial functions somatosensation and spatial memory motoric instinctive affective and intellectual behaviors \n Disinhibition syndromes have also been reported with mania-like manifestations in old age with lesions to the orbito-frontal and basotemporal cortex involving limbic and frontal connections orbitofrontal circuit especially in the right hemisphere \n Behavioral disinhibition as a result of damage to frontal lobe could be seen as a result of consumption of alcohol and central nervous system depressants drugs e g benzodiazepines that disinhibit the frontal cortex from self-regulation and control \n It has also been argued that ADHD hyperactive/impulsive subtype have a general behavioural disinhibition beyond impulsivity and many morbidities or complications of ADHD e g conduct disorder anti-social personality disorder substance abuse and risk taking behaviours are all consequences of untreated behavioural disinhibition \n Associative learning concept \n Within the realm of \n classical Pavlovian conditioning \n disinhibition \n is a fundamental process of associative \n learning \n characterized by the recurrence of a conditioned response after \n extinction \n trials have eliminated said response elicited by the presentation of a novel stimulus The following process best illustrates this form of disinhibition \n An organism undergoes some series of classical conditioning trials until the conditioned stimulus reliably elicits a conditioned response At this time the organism then undergoes extinction trials until the conditioned stimulus no longer reliably elicits the conditioned response Disinhibition occurs when after these extinction trials a new novel stimulus is presented to the organism and at which time the organism again begins to show the previously extinguished conditioned response This phenomenon is not to be confused with \n spontaneous recovery \n though the concepts seem similar \n Disinhibition is the temporary increase in strength of an extinguished response due to an unrelated stimulus effect This differs from spontaneous recovery which is the temporary increase in strength of a conditioned response which is likely to occur during extinction after the passage of time These effects occur during both classical and \n operant conditioning \n citation needed \n Colloquial usage \n Clinical terms sometimes gain a broader usage and meaning in society

aggression socially inappropriate behaviour sexual disinhibition wandering and repetitive behavior \n Disinhibited behaviour occurs when people do not follow the social rules about what or where to say or do something People who are disinhibited may come across as rude tactless or even offensive For example a person with a brain injury may make a comment about how ugly another person is or a person with dementia may have lost their social manners and look as though they are deliberately harassing another person \n The reasons why these behaviors may occur include \n Damage to the brain such as in brain injury usually the frontal cortex areas part behind the forehead \n Difficulty thinking about the consequences of their behavior \n Misinterpreting social cues poor social judgement \n Being unable to communicate in an appropriate way \n Feeling lonely \n Discomfort such as being too hot or cold may lead to undressing or a urinary tract infection may lead to touching one's own genitals \n Provocation \n Treatment approaches \n Positive Behaviour Support PBS is a treatment approach that looks at the best way to work with each individual with disabilities A behavioural therapist conducts a functional analysis of behaviour which helps to determine ways to improve the quality of life for the person and does not just deal with problem behaviour \n PBS also acknowledges the needs of support staff and includes strategies to manage crises when they arise The following model is a brief guide to staff to remind them of key things to think about when planning support for a person with disabilities There are two main objectives reacting situationally when the behaviour occurs and then acting proactively to prevent the behaviour from occurring \n Reactive \n Reactive strategies include \n Redirection distracting the person by offering another activity or changing the topic of conversation Offer the person a choice of or things but no more than because this can be overwhelming In offering a choice make sure to pause to allow the person time to process the information and give a response \n Talking to the person and finding out what the problem is \n Working out what the person's behaviour is trying to communicate \n Crisis management \n Proactive \n Proactive strategies to prevent problems can include \n Change the environment This can include increasing opportunities for access to a variety of activities balancing cognitively and physically demanding activities with periods of rest providing a predictable environment in order to reduce the level of cognitive demands on the person trying to provide consistent routines be mindful of events that may not occur try not to make promises that cannot be kept if unable to go out at a particular time then say so checking for safety in the home environment e g changing/moving furniture \n Teach a skill These can include general skills development of useful communication strategies coping skills e g teach the person what to do when feeling angry anxious \n Individual behaviour support plans These involve reinforcing specific desirable behaviour and ignoring the specific undesirable behaviour unless it is dangerous the priority is to keep both people safe through a crisis plan which might involve removing sharp objects or weapons escaping to a safe place giving the person time to calm down avoiding things you know upsets the person strategies to increase engagement in activities \n Broadly speaking when the behaviour occurs assertively in a nonjudgemental clear unambiguous way provide feedback that the behaviour is inappropriate and say what you prefer instead For example \"Jane you're standing too close when you are speaking to me I feel uncomfortable please take a step back\" or \"I don't like it when you say I look hot in front of your wife I feel uncomfortable I am your Attendant Carer/Support Worker I am here to help you with your shopping\" Then re-direct to the next activity Any subsequent behaviour ignore Then generally as almost all behaviour is communication understand what the behaviour is trying to communicate and look at ways to have the need met in more appropriate ways \n Boldness \n Frontotemporal dementia \n Online disinhibition effect \n Orbitofrontal cortex"},

their group membership The word is often used to refer to preconceived usually unfavorable feelings towards people or a person because of their \n sex \n gender \n beliefs \n values \n social class \n age \n disability \n religion \n sexuality \n race \n / \n ethnicity \n language \n nationality \n beauty \n occupation \n education \n criminality \n sport team affiliation \n or other personal characteristics In this case it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on their perceived group membership \n Prejudice can also refer to unfounded beliefs \n and it may include \"any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence\" \n Gordon Allport \n defined prejudice as a \"feeling favorable or unfavorable toward a person or thing prior to or not based on actual experience\" \n For the evolutionary psychology perspective see \n Prejudice from an evolutionary perspective \n Auestad \n defines prejudice as characterized by 'symbolic transfer' transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category resistance to change and overgeneralization \n Historical approaches \n Contemporary theories and empirical findings \n Controversies and prominent topics \n Sexism \n Nationalism \n Classism \n Sexual discrimination \n Racism \n Religious discrimination \n Linguistic discrimination \n Neurological discrimination \n Multiculturalism \n Reducing prejudice \n The contact hypothesis \n Empirical research \n Further reading \n Historical approaches \n The first \n psychological research \n conducted on prejudice occurred in the 1920s This research attempted to prove \n white supremacy \n One article from which reviewed studies on race concluded that the studies seemed \"to indicate the mental superiority of the white race\" \n These studies along with other research led many psychologists to view prejudice as a natural response to inferior races \n In the 1930s and 1940s this perspective began to change due to the increasing concern about \n anti-Semitism \n At the time theorists viewed prejudice as pathological and they thus looked for personality syndromes linked with \n racism \n Theodor Adorno \n believed that prejudice stemmed from an \n authoritarian personality \n he believed that people with authoritarian personalities were the most likely to be prejudiced against groups of lower status He described authoritarians as \"rigid thinkers who obeyed authority saw the world as \n black and white \n and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies\" \n In \n Gordon Allport \n linked prejudice to categorical thinking Allport claimed that prejudice is a natural and normal process for humans According to him \"The human mind must think with the aid of categories Once formed categories are the basis for normal prejudgment We cannot possibly avoid this process Orderly living depends upon it \" \n In the 1970s research began to show that prejudice tends to be based on \n favoritism towards one's own groups \n rather than negative feelings towards another group According to \n Marilyn Brewer \n prejudice \"may develop not because \n outgroups \n are hated but because positive emotions such as admiration sympathy and trust are reserved for the ingroup \" \n In \n Thomas Pettigrew \n described the \n ultimate attribution error \n and its role in prejudice The ultimate attribution error occurs when ingroup members \" attribute negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes more than they would for identical ingroup behavior and attribute positive outgroup behavior to one or more of the following causes a a fluke or exceptional case b luck or special advantage c high motivation and effort and d situational factors \" \n Youeng-Bruehl \n argued that prejudice cannot be treated in the singular one should rather speak of different prejudices as characteristic of different character types Her theory defines prejudices as being social defences distinguishing between an obsessional character structure primarily linked with anti-semitism hysterical characters primarily associated with racism and narcissistic characters linked with sexism \n Contemporary theories and empirical findings \n The \n out-group homogeneity \n effect is the perception that members of an out-group are more similar homogenous than members of the in-group Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools \n Princeton University \n and \n Rutgers University \n Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study Then the participants were asked to guess what percentage of the videotaped students' classmates would choose the same Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members the rival school than between members of their in-group \n The justification-suppression model of prejudice was created by Christian Crandall and Amy Eshleman \n This model explains that people face a conflict between the desire to express prejudice and the desire to maintain a positive \n self-concept \n This conflict causes people to search for justification for disliking an out-group and to use that justification to avoid negative feelings \n cognitive dissonance \n about themselves when they act on their dislike of the out-group \n The \n realistic conflict theory \n states that competition between limited resources leads to increased negative prejudices and discrimination This can be seen even when the resource is insignificant In the Robber's Cave experiment \n negative prejudice and hostility was created between two summer camps after sports competitions for small prizes The hostility was lessened after the two competing camps were forced to cooperate on tasks to achieve a common goal \n Another contemporary theory is the \n integrated threat theory \n ITT which was developed by Walter G Stephan \n It draws from and builds upon several other psychological explanations of prejudice and ingroup/outgroup behaviour such as the realistic conflict theory and \n symbolic racism \n It also uses the \n social identity theory \n perspective as the basis for its validity that is it assumes that individuals operate in a group-based context where group memberships form a part of individual identity ITT posits that outgroup prejudice and discrimination is caused when individuals perceive an outgroup to be threatening in some way ITT defines four threats \n Realistic threats \n Symbolic threats \n Intergroup anxiety \n Negative stereotypes \n Realistic threats are tangible such as competition for a natural resource or a threat to income Symbolic threats arise from a perceived difference in cultural values between groups or a perceived imbalance of power for example an ingroup perceiving an outgroup's religion as incompatible with theirs Intergroup anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness experienced in the presence of an outgroup or outgroup member which constitutes a threat because interactions with other groups cause negative feelings e g a threat to comfortable interactions Negative stereotypes are similarly threats in that individuals anticipate negative behaviour from outgroup members in line with the perceived stereotype for example that the outgroup is violent Often these stereotypes are associated with emotions such as fear and anger ITT differs from other threat theories by including intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes as threat types \n Additionally \n social dominance theory \n states that society can be viewed as group-based hierarchies In competition for scarce resources such as housing or employment dominant groups create prejudiced \"legitimizing myths\" to provide moral and intellectual justification for their dominant position over other groups and validate their claim over the limited resources \n Legitimizing myths such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased merit norms work to maintain these prejudiced hierarchies \n Prejudice can be a central contributing factor to depression \n This can occur in someone who is a prejudice victim being the target of someone else's prejudice or when people have prejudice against themselves that causes their own depression \n Paul Bloom argues that while prejudice can be irrational and have terrible consequences it is natural and often quite rational This is because prejudices are based on the human tendency to categorise objects and people based on prior experience This means people make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category with the resulting predictions usually being accurate though not always Bloom argues that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and normal interaction quoting William Hazlitt who stated \"Without the aid of prejudice and custom I should not be able to find my way my across the room nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances nor what to feel in any relation of life\" \n Controversies and prominent topics \n One can be prejudiced against or have a preconceived notion about someone due to any characteristic they find to be unusual or undesirable A few commonplace examples of prejudice are those based on someone's race gender nationality social status sexual orientation or religious affiliation and controversies may arise from any given topic \n Sexism \n Sexism \n Sexism also called gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's \n sex or gender \n Sexism can affect either gender but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls \n The discussion of such sentiments and actual gender differences and stereotypes continue to be controversial topics Throughout history women have been thought of as being subordinate to men often being ignored in areas like the academia or belittled altogether Traditionally men were thought of as being more capable than women mentally and physically \n In the field of social psychology prejudice studies like the \"Who Likes Competent Women\" study led the way for gender-based research on prejudice \n This resulted in two broad themes or focuses in the field the first being a focus on attitudes toward \n gender equality \n and the second focusing on people's beliefs about men and women \n Today studies based on sexism continue in the field of psychology as researchers try to understand how people's thoughts feelings and behaviors influence and are influenced by others \n Nationalism \n Nationalism \n Nationalism is a sentiment based on common cultural characteristics that binds a population and often produces a policy of national independence or \n separatism \n It suggests a \"shared identity\" amongst a nation's people that minimizes differences within the group and emphasizes perceived boundaries between the group and non-members \n This leads to the assumption that members of the nation have more in common than they actually do that they are \"culturally unified\" even if injustices within the nation based on differences like status and race exist \n During times of conflict between one nation and another nationalism is controversial since it may function as a buffer for criticism when it comes to the nation's own problems since it makes the nation's own hierarchies and internal conflicts appear to be natural \n It may also serve a way of rallying the people of the nation in support of a particular political goal \n Nationalism usually involves a push for conformity obedience and solidarity amongst the nation's people and can result not only in feelings of public responsibility but also in a narrow sense of community due to the exclusion of those who are considered outsiders \n Since the identity of nationalists is linked to their allegiance to the state the presence of strangers who do not share this allegiance may result in hostility \n Classism \n Classism \n Classism is defined by \n dictionary com \n as \"a biased or discriminatory attitude on distinctions made between social or economic classes \" \n The idea of separating people based on class is controversial in itself Some argue that \n economic inequality \n is an unavoidable aspect of society so there will always be a ruling class \n Some also argue that even within the most \n egalitarian \n societies in history some form of ranking based on social status takes place Therefore one may believe the existence of social classes is a natural feature of society \n Others argue the contrary According to \n anthropological \n evidence for the majority of the time the human species has been in existence humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned \n Also when social ranking did occur it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system \n This evidence has been used to support the idea that the existence of a social class system is unnecessary Overall society has neither come to a consensus over the necessity of the class system nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because of the class system \n Sexual discrimination \n Main articles \n Sexual discrimination \n and \n Homophobia \n One's sexual orientation is the \"direction of one's sexual interest toward members of the same opposite or both sexes\" \n Like most minority groups \n homosexuals \n and \n bisexuals \n are not immune to prejudice or stereotypes from the majority group They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences a term for such intense hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is \n homophobia \n Due to what social psychologists call the vividness effect a tendency to notice only certain distinctive characteristics the majority population tends to draw conclusions like gays flaunt their sexuality \n Such images may be easily recalled to mind due to their vividness making it harder to appraise the entire situation \n The majority population may not only think that homosexuals flaunt their sexuality or are \"too gay\" but may also erroneously believe that homosexuals are easy to identify and label as being gay or lesbian when compared to others who are not homosexual \n The idea of \n heterosexual privilege \n seems to flourish in society Research and questionnaires are formulated to fit the majority i e \n heterosexuals \n This discussion of whether heterosexuals are the privileged group and whether homosexuals are a minimized group is controversial Research shows that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a powerful feature of many labor markets For example controlling for human capital studies show that gay men earn 10% - 32% less than heterosexual men in the United States and that there is significant discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation in many labor markets \n Racism \n Racism is defined as the belief that physical characteristics determine cultural traits and that racial characteristics make some groups superior \n By separating people into \n hierarchies \n based upon their race it has been argued that unequal treatment among the different groups of people is just and fair due to their \n genetic \n differences \n Racism can occur amongst any group that can be identified based upon physical features or even characteristics of their culture \n Though people may be lumped together and called a specific race everyone does not fit neatly into such categories making it hard to define and describe a race accurately \n Scientific racism \n began to flourish in the eighteenth century and was greatly influenced by \n Charles Darwin \n 's \n evolutionary \n studies as well as ideas taken from the writings of philosophers like \n Aristotle \n for example Aristotle believed in the concept of \" \n natural slaves \n \" \n This concept focuses on the necessity of hierarchies and how some people are bound to be on the bottom of the pyramid Though racism has been a prominent topic in history there is still debate over whether race actually exists \n citation needed \n making the discussion of race a controversial topic Even though the concept of race is still being debated the effects of racism are apparent Racism and other forms of prejudice can affect a person's behavior thoughts and feelings and social psychologists strive to study these effects \n Religious discrimination \n Religious discrimination \n While various religions teach their members to be tolerant of those who are different and to have compassion throughout history there have been \n wars \n pogroms \n and other forms of violence motivated by hatred of religious groups \n In the modern world researchers in western educated industrialized rich and democratic countries have done various studies exploring the relationship between religion and prejudice thus far they have received mixed results A study done with US college students found that those who reported religion to be very influential in their lives seem to have a higher rate of prejudice than those who reported not being religious \n Other studies found that religion has a positive effect on people as far as prejudice is concerned \n This difference in results may be attributed to the differences in religious practices or religious interpretations amongst the individuals Those who practice \"institutionalized religion\" which focuses more on social and political aspects of religious events are more likely to have an increase in prejudice \n Those who practice \"interiorized religion\" in which believers devote themselves to their beliefs are most likely to have a decrease in prejudice \n Linguistic discrimination \n Linguistic discrimination \n Individuals or groups may be treated unfairly based solely on their use of language This use of language may include the individual's \n native language \n or other characteristics of the person's speech such as an \n accent \n the size of \n vocabulary \n whether the person uses complex and varied words and \n syntax \n It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another In the mid-1980s \n linguist \n Tove Skutnabb-Kangas captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism Kangas defined linguicism as the ideologies and structures used to \"legitimate effectuate and reproduce unequal division of power and resources both material and non-material between groups which are defined on the basis of language \" \n Neurological discrimination \n Neurodiversity \n Broadly speaking attribution of low social status to those who do not conform to \n neurotypical \n expectations of personality and behaviour This can manifest through assumption of 'disability' status to those who are high functioning enough to exist outside of diagnostic criteria yet do not desire to or are unable to conform their behaviour to conventional patterns This is a controversial and somewhat contemporary concept with various disciplinary approaches promoting conflicting messages what normality constitutes the degree of acceptable \n individual difference \n within that category and the precise criteria for what constitutes medical disorder This has been most prominent in the case of high-functioning Autism \n where direct cognitive benefits increasingly appear to come at the expense of social intelligence \n Discrimination may also extend to other high functioning individuals carrying pathological phenotypes such as those with \n Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \n and \n Bipolar spectrum disorders \n In these cases there are indications that perceived or actual socially disadvantageous cognitive traits are directly correlated with advantageous cognitive traits in other domains notably creativity and divergent thinking \n and yet these strengths might become systematically overlooked The case for \"neurological discrimination\" as such lies in the expectation that one's professional capacity may be judged by the quality of ones social interaction which can in such cases be an inaccurate and discriminatory metric for employment suitability \n Since there are moves by some experts to have these higher-functioning extremes reclassified as extensions of human personality \n any legitimisation of discrimination against these groups would fit the very definition of prejudice as medical validation for such discrimination becomes redundant Recent advancements in \n behavioural genetics \n and \n neuroscience \n have made this a very relevant issue of discussion with existing frameworks requiring significant overhaul to accommodate the strength of findings over the last decade \n Multiculturalism \n Multiculturalism \n Humans have an evolved propensity to think categorically about social groups manifested in cognitive processes with broad implications for public and political endorsement of multicultural policy according to psychologists \n Richard J Crisp \n and Rose Meleady \n They postulated a cognitive-evolutionary account of human adaptation to social diversity that explains general resistance to multiculturalism and offer a reorienting call for scholars and policy-makers who seek intervention-based solutions to the problem of prejudice \n Reducing prejudice \n The contact hypothesis \n The \n contact hypothesis \n predicts that prejudice can only be reduced when in-group and out-group members are brought together \n In particular there are six conditions that must be met to reduce prejudice as were cultivated in \n Elliot Aronson \n 's \n \"jigsaw\" teaching technique \n First the in- and out-groups must have a degree of mutual interdependence Second both groups need to share a common goal Third the two groups must have equal status Fourth there must be frequent opportunities for informal and interpersonal contact between groups Fifth there should be multiple contacts between the in- and the out-groups Finally \n social norms \n of equality must exist and be present to foster prejudice reduction \n Empirical research \n Academics Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp conducted a \n meta-analysis \n of studies involving a quarter of a million participants in nations to examine how intergroup contact reduces prejudice They found that three \n mediators \n are of particular importance Intergroup contact reduces prejudice by enhancing knowledge about the outgroup reducing anxiety about intergroup contact and increasing \n empathy \n and perspective-taking While all three of these mediators had mediational effects the mediational value of increased knowledge was less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy \n In addition some individuals confront discrimination when they see it happen with research finding that individuals are more likely to confront when they perceive benefits to themselves and are less likely to confront when concerned about others' reactions \n Ambivalent prejudice \n Benevolent prejudice \n Bigotry \n Common ingroup identity \n Conformity \n Hostile

linear hierarchy pecking order each member has a relative rank In a despotic hierarchy one member is dominant \n The manifestation of \n intrasexual conflict \n can be observed in one of two systems The social order can be either egalitarian or despotic In a linear ranking system often referred to as a \n pecking order \n every member of the gender is recognized as either dominant or submissive relative to every other member creating a linear distribution of rank For example groups of \n spotted hyenas \n and \n brown hyenas \n both demonstrate linear dominance \n In a despotic system one member is considered dominant while all other members of the living group are equally submissive Examples of despotic social systems are found in \n meerkat \n gray wolf \n gorilla \n Neolamprologus pulcher \n and \n African wild dog \n Wedge-capped capuchins \n have a clear dominance hierarchy \n Determining the outcome of conflict \n Patterns of animal conflict reveal important insights into the evolution of behavior and the influence of behavior on relationships that develop in a social group Pair-wise interactions have been observed to promote social hierarchies within groups of animals where individuals with successful \n agonistic behaviors \n often achieve dominance These behaviors which include aggression threat displays and fighting are indicative of competition over resources such as food or mates However they may vary based on the situation and position of the individuals involved \n citation needed \n Animal decisions regarding involvement in conflict are defined by the interplay between the costs and benefits of agonistic behaviors When initially developed \n game theory \n the study of optimal strategies during pair-wise conflict was grounded in the false assumption that animals engaged in conflict were of equal fighting ability Modifications however have provided increased focus on the differences between the fighting capabilities of animals and raised questions about their evolutionary development These differences are believed to determine the outcomes of fights their intensity and animal decisions to submit or continue fighting The influence of aggression threats and fighting on the strategies of individuals engaged in conflict has proven integral to establishing social hierarchies reflective of dominant-subordinate interactions \n The asymmetries between individuals have been categorized into three types of interactions \n Resource-holding potential Animals that are better able to defend resources often win without much physical contact \n Resource value Animals more invested in a resource are likely to invest more in the fight despite potential for incurring higher costs \n Intruder retreats When participants are of equal fighting ability and competing for a certain \n territory \n the resident of the territory is likely to end as the victor because he values the territory more This can be explained further by looking at the example of the \n common shrews \n If one participant believes he is the resident of the territory he will win when the opponent is weaker or food is scarce However if both shrews believe they are the true territory holder the one with the greater need for food and therefore the one that values the resource more is most likely to win \n As expected the individual who emerges triumphant is rewarded with the dominant status having demonstrated his/her physical superiority However the costs incurred to the defeated which include loss of reproductive opportunities and quality food can hinder the individuals fitness In order to minimize these losses animals generally retreat from fighting or displaying fighting ability unless there are obvious cues indicating victory These often involve characteristics that provide an advantage during agonistic behavior such as size of body displays etc Red stags for example engage in exhausting roaring contests to exhibit their strength Huntingford However such an activity would impose more costs than benefits for unfit stags and compel them to retreat from the contest Larger stags have also been known to make lower-frequency threat signals acting as indicators of body size strength and dominance \n citation needed \n Engaging in agonistic behavior can be very costly and thus there are many examples in nature of animals who achieve dominance in more passive ways In some the dominance status of an individual is clearly visible eliminating the need for agonistic behavior In wintering bird flocks \n white-crowned sparrows \n display a unique white plumage the higher the percentage of the crown that consists of white feathers the higher the status of the individual \n For other animals the time spent in the group serves as a determinant of dominance status Pack members of gray wolves for example need the time to reach the top of the ladder Rank may also be acquired from maternal dominance rank In \n rhesus monkeys \n offspring gain dominance status based on the rank of the motherthe higher ranked the mother the higher ranked the offspring will be Yahner Similarly the status of a male \n Canada goose \n is determined by the rank of his family Although dominance is determined differently in each case it is influenced by the relationships between members of social groups \n These observed interactions reflect the battle for resources The association between resource availability and agonistic behavior suggests that animal conflict is adaptive by enabling competition and exploitation of available food and mates The outcome of these interactions results in important social patterns that define hierarchies and therefore future access to resources \n Dominance \n Benefits \n Reproductive success \n In primates one of the most widely studied hierarchal groups many studies have found a positive relationship between high rank and reproductive success In \n baboons \n higher-ranking males have the highest reproductive success due to increased female acquisition Also female baboons benefit from increased rank because high-ranking females produce more surviving offspring \n Bonnet macaques \n gain increased reproductive success with high rank High-ranking males have more access to fertile females and consequently partake in most of the matings within the group in one population three males were responsible for over 75% of matings In this population males often vary in their rank and as they gain rank they gain more time spent exclusively with fertile females the opposite is seen as males drop in rank \n In many primates including bonnet macaques and \n rhesus monkeys \n the offspring of high-ranking individuals have better fitness and thus an increased rate of survival This is most likely a function of two factors The first is that high-ranking males mate with high-ranking females Assuming their high rank is correlated with higher fitness and fighting ability this trait will be conferred to their offspring The second factor is that higher-ranking parents probably provide better protection to their offspring and thus ensure higher survival rates \n In rodents the highest-ranking male frequently sires the most offspring The same pattern is found in most carnivores such as the \n dwarf mongoose \n The dwarf mongoose lives in a social system with one dominant pair The dominant female produces all or almost all of the offspring in the living group and the dominant male has first access to her during her oestrus period In red deer the males who experienced winter dominance resulting from greater access to preferred foraging sites had higher ability to get and maintain larger harems during the mating season \n In many monogamous bird species the dominant pairs tend to get the best territories which in turn promote offspring survival and adult health In dunnocks a species of birds that experiences many mating systems sometimes individuals will form a group that will have one dominant male who achieves all of the mating in the group \n In the monogynous bee species \n Melipona subnitida \n it is noted that the queen wants to maintain reproductive success and does so by preventing workers from caring for their cells pushing or hitting them using her antennae Workers additionally have been noted to display aggression towards males claiming priority over the cells when males try to use them to place eggs This species further demonstrates the conflict between hierarchy and reproductive success \n Foraging success \n Another benefit to high-ranking individuals is increased foraging success and access to food resources During times of water shortage the highest-ranking vervet females have greater access than subordinates females to water in tree holes In \n chacma baboons \n the high-ranking males have the first access to vertebrate prey that has been caught by the group and in yellow baboons the dominant males feed for longer without being interrupted \n citation needed \n In many bird species the dominant individuals have higher rates of food intake including \n dark-eyed juncos \n and \n oystercatchers \n The dominant individuals in these groups fill themselves up first and fill up more quickly so they spend less time foraging which reduces the risk of predation Thus they have increased survival because of increased nutrition and decreased predation \n Costs \n Despite the benefits to being of a high rank in a hierarchal group there are also costs which offset these benefits The most common costs to high-ranking individuals are higher metabolic rates and higher levels of stress hormones \n In \n great tits \n and \n pied flycatchers \n high-ranking individuals experience higher resting metabolic rates and therefore need to consume more food in order to maintain fitness and activity levels compared to subordinates in their groups The energetic costs of defending territory mates and other resources can be very consuming and cause high-ranking individuals who spend more time in these activities to lose body mass over long periods of dominance Therefore their physical condition decreases the longer they spend partaking in these high-energy activities and they lose rank as a function of age \n In wild male baboons the highest ranking male also known as the alpha experiences high levels of both testosterone and glucocorticoid which indicates that high-ranking males undergo higher levels of stress which reduces fitness Reduced health and longevity occurs because these two hormones have immunosuppressant activity which reduces survival and presents opportunities for parasitic infestation and other health risks This reduced fitness due to the alpha position results in individuals maintaining high rank for shorter periods of time and having an overall reduced health and longevity from the physical strain and costs of the position \n When to seek high rank \n Given the benefits and costs of possessing a high rank within a hierarchal group there are certain characteristics of individuals groups and environments that determine whether an individual will benefit from a high rank Individual characteristics include whether or not high rank gives them access to valuable resources such as mates and food Individuals will often weigh the cost of the resource against factors including their age intelligence experience and physical fitness which can determine the costs to gaining rank \n citation needed \n Hierarchy results as an accumulation of individual interaction group dynamics and sharing of resources therefore group size and composition can affect the dominance decisions of high-ranking individuals and hierarchy type For example in a large group with many males it may be very challenging for the highest-ranking male to dominate all the mating opportunities so some mate sharing probably exists These occasional mating opportunities available to subordinates reduce the likelihood of subordinates challenging the dominant male - mating is no longer an all-or-nothing game and the scraps are enough to placate most subordinates Another aspect that can determine dominance hierarchies is the environment In populations of Kenyan vervets high-ranking females have higher foraging success when the food resources are clumped but when food is distributed throughout an area they lose their advantage because subordinate females can acquire food with less risk of encountering a dominant female \n Subordinance \n Benefits \n Direct benefits \n There are a number of benefits to being subordinate Subordination is beneficial in agonistic conflicts where rank predicts the outcome of a fight Less injury will occur if subordinate individuals avoid fighting with higher-ranking individuals who would win a large percentage of the time - knowledge of the pecking order keeps both parties from incurring the costs of a prolonged fight In hens it has been observed that both dominants and subordinates benefit from a stable hierarchical environment because fewer challenges means more resources can be dedicated to laying eggs \n It is also possible that in groups consisting of highly related individuals kin selection influences the stability of hierarchical dominance If a subordinate individual is closely related to the dominant individual the subordinate may benefit more genetically by assisting the dominant individual as his or her genes are still passed along in the offspring of the dominant individual In a study of male \n savanna baboons \n alpha males exhibited high levels of testosterone and stress This stress and \n testosterone \n over a long period of time can lead to decreased fitness The lowest ranking males in the hierarchy also demonstrated high stress levels suggesting that it is the beta males that gain the most fitness avoiding stress while still maintaining some of reproductive and nutritional benefits of moderate rank \n Mitigating costs of being subordinate \n Subordinate animals engage in a number of behaviors in order to outweigh the costs of low rank Dispersal is often associated with increased mortality and subordination may decrease the potential benefits of leaving the group In the \n red fox \n it has been shown that subordinate individuals given the opportunity to desert often do not due to the risk of death and the low possibility that they would establish themselves as dominant members in a new group \n There is also the possibility that a subordinate individual who stays may become a high-ranking individual at a future time if the alpha male dies or is usurped \n Fighting for occasional success \n Fighting with the dominant male s is a risky behavior that may result in defeat injury or even death In bighorn sheep however subordinates occasionally win a fight for a female and they father 44% of the lambs born in the population These sheep live in large flocks and dominance hierarchies are often restructured each breeding season \n Sneak copulations and mimicking a female \n Burying beetles \n which have a social order involving one dominant male controlling most access to mates display a behavior known as sneak copulation While one male at a carcass has a mating advantage subordinate males will tempt females away from the carcass with pheromones and attempt to copulate before the dominant male can drive them forcefully away \n In \n flat lizards \n young males take advantage of their underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics to engage in sneak copulations These young males mimic all the visual signs of a female lizard in order to successfully approach a female and copulate without detection by the dominant male This strategy does not work at close range because the chemical signals given off by the sneaky males reveal their true nature and they are chased out by the dominant \n Ganging up \n Savanna baboons display a number of mating tactics correlated with their age One such tactic attributed to older subordinate males involves forming alliances to combat higher-ranking males in order to achieve access to females for copulation These lowest ranking males would get no opportunity to copulate otherwise \n Costs \n Decreased fitness and reduced access to nutrition \n Subordinate individuals suffer a range of costs from dominance hierarchies one of the most notable being reduced access to food sources When a resource is obtained dominant individuals are first to feed as well as taking the longest time Subordinates also lose out in shelter and nesting sites \n Brown hyenas \n which display defined linear dominance in both sexes allow subordinate males and females decreased time of feeding at a carcass \n In \n toque monkeys \n subordinates are often displaced from feeding sites by dominant males Additionally they are excluded from sleeping sites and they suffer reduced growth and increased mortality \n Decreased reproductive success \n Subordinate individuals often demonstrate a huge reproductive disadvantage in dominance hierarchies Among \n brown hyenas \n subordinate females have less opportunity to rear young in the communal den and thus had decreased survival of offspring when compared to high-ranking individuals Subordinate males have far less copulations with females compared to the high-ranking males \n In \n African wild dogs \n which live in social packs separated into male and female hierarchies top ranking alpha females have been observed to produce 76-81% of all litters \n Reverse \n Boehm having explored data from societies spread across the globe ranging from small hunting and gathering bands to more sedentary chiefdoms suggested that with the advent of anatomically modern humans who continued to live in small groups and had not yet domesticated plants and animals \n hunter-gatherer \n it is very likely that all human societies practised \n egalitarianism \n and that most of the time they did so very successfully \n Boehm writes \n \"As long as followers remain vigilantly egalitarian because they understand the nature of domination and leaders remain cognizant of this ambivalence-based vigilance deliberate control of leaders may remain for the most part highly routinized and ethnographically unobvious \" \n Boehm identifies the following mechanisms ensuring the Reverse Dominance Hierarchy \n Public Opinion \n Criticism and Ridicule Disobedience and Extreme Sanctions Further characteristics include ambivalence towards leaders and anticipation of domination \n Interpersonal complementarity \n The \n interpersonal complementarity hypothesis \n suggests that obedience and authority are reciprocal complementary processes That is it predicts that one group members behaviours will elicit a predictable set of actions from other group members Friendly behaviours are predicted to be met with friendly behaviours and hostile behaviours are predicted to be reciprocated with similar hostile behaviours When an individual acts in a dominant authoritative manner in a group this behaviour tends to prompt submissive responses from other group members Similarly when group members display submissive behaviour others feel inclined to display dominant behaviours in return Tiedens and Fragle found that hierarchical differentiation plays a significant role in liking behaviour in groups \n Individuals prefer to interact with other group members whose power or status behaviour complements their own That is to say group members who behave submissively when talking to someone who appears to be in control are better liked and similarly individuals who display dominant behaviours e g taking charge issuing orders are more liked when interacting with docile subservient individuals \n Regulation mechanisms \n The most basic interaction that establishes a Dominance Hierarchy is the dyad or paired interaction among individuals To study the formation of hierarchies scientists have often used the dyadic method in which two individuals are forced to interact isolated from others All individuals in the group are paired with each other i e a \n round-robin \n in isolation until a hierarchy can be deduced The process of deducing the hierarchy involves the construction of a dominance matrix in which wins/ties are expressed in relation to each member of the group \n citation needed \n Individuals with greater hierarchical status tend to displace those ranked lower from access to space to \n food \n and to \n mating \n opportunities Thus individuals with higher \n social status \n tend to have greater \n reproductive success \n by mating more often and having more resources to invest in the survival of \n offspring \n Hence hierarchy serves as an intrinsic factor for population control ensuring adequate resources for the dominant individuals and thus preventing widespread starvation \n Territorial \n behavior \n enhances this effect \n These hierarchies are not fixed and depend on any number of changing factors among them are \n age \n gender \n body size \n intelligence \n and \n aggressiveness \n For instance in linear hierarchies a lost top ranked individual \"alpha\" is usually replaced by its direct subordinate \"beta\" this individual assumes its role in the group and gains the same benefits \n citation needed \n In \n eusocial \n species decrease of fertility is among the main reasons for ranking displacement \n Brood hierarchy \n The \n blue-footed booby \n brood of two chicks always has a dominance hierarchy due to the asynchronous hatching of the eggs One egg is laid four days before the other and incubation starts immediately after laying so the elder chick is hatched four days before the younger chick and has a four-day head start on growth The elder stronger chick almost always becomes the dominant chick During times of food shortage the dominant chick often kills the subordinate chick by either repeatedly pecking or by ousting the younger chick from the nest The brood hierarchy makes it easier for the subordinate chick to die quietly in times of food scarcity which provides an efficient system for booby parents to maximize their investment \n Hormones and dominance \n It has been shown that modulation of \n hormone \n levels after \n hibernation \n may be associated with the establishment of dominance hierarchies within the social order of the paper wasp \n Polistes dominulus \n Former studies have shown that dominance hierarchies within the paper wasp species is dependent on the queen also known as a foundress though the mechanism behind the establishment is currently under investigation Recent research suggests that this manifestation may be dependent on specific hormones contained within the foundress Laboratory experiments have shown that when foundresses are injected with \n juvenile hormone \n JH a hormone responsible for regulating growth and development in many insect species including wasps the foundresses exhibit an increase in dominant behavior compared to those who had not been injected \n Further evidence shows that foundresses that have a larger \n corpora allata \n a region of the female wasp brain responsible for the synthesis and secretion of JH are naturally more dominant \n In an effort to determine if JH is indeed responsible for manifesting dominance a follow up experiment was done utilizing \n 20-hydroxyecdysone \n an \n ecdysone \n known to enhance maturation and size of \n oocytes \n The size of the oocytes plays a significant role in establishing dominance within \n Polistes dominulus \n and thus researchers used this hormone to compare which condition either JH or 20-hydroxyecdysone treated induced higher levels of dominance intensities within foundresses \n The results showed that the 20-hydroxyecdysone treated foundresses showed increased dominance compared to those foundresses treated with JH and suggests that 20-hydroxyecdysone not JH may play a larger role in establishing dominance Roseler \n et al \n Subsequent research however suggests that JH is implicated in the manifestation of dominance though it only exerts dominance-type effects on certain individuals By recording the number of mounting attempts between rival foundresses as a measure of dominance researchers found that when injected with the same amount of JH larger foundresses showed more mounting behaviors compared to foundresses that were smaller Additionally the more dominant foundress tended to show an increased number of oocytes contained within her \n ovaries \n It was concluded that larger foundresses are more reproductively fit and thus JH which is responsible for the growth and maturation of the ovaries be more active within these individuals compared to the smaller less \n fertile \n foundresses though the mechanism of action and/or any synergistic effects between JH and other hormones remains unknown \n The effect of relative rank on stress hormone levels in \n savanna baboons \n The hormone model of dominance and reproductive capacity has also been demonstrated in the naked mole-rat \n Heterocephalus glaber \n It has previously been established that the dominance hierarchy within the species is dependent on the highest ranking female queen and her ability to suppress critically important reproductive hormones in male and female sub-dominants In sub-dominant males appears that \n lutenizing hormone \n and \n testosterone \n are suppressed while in females it appears that the suppression involves the entire suppression of the \n ovarian cycle \n This suppression reduces sexual \n virility \n and behavior and thus redirects the sub-dominant's behavior into helping the queen with her offspring \n though the mechanisms of how this is accomplished are debated Former research suggests that \n primer \n pheromones \n secreted by the queen cause direct suppression of these vital reproductive hormones and functions however current evidence suggests that it is not the secretion of pheromones which act to suppress reproductive function but rather the queens extremely high levels of circulating testosterone which cause her to exert intense dominance and \n aggressiveness \n on the colony and thus \"scare\" the other mole-rats into submission \n Research has shown that removal of the queen from the colony allows the reestablishment of reproductive function in sub-dominant individuals To see if a priming pheromone secreted by the queen was indeed causing reproductive suppression researchers removed the queen from the colony but did not remove her bedding They reasoned that if a primer pheromones were on the bedding then the sub-dominant's reproductive function should continue to be suppressed Instead however they found that the sub-dominants quickly regained reproductive function even in the presence of the queens bedding and thus it was concluded that primer pheromones do not seem to play a role in suppressing reproductive function \n Evidence also suggests that \n glucocorticoids \n signaling molecules commonly known as \n stress hormones \n produced by the \n adrenal glands \n which stimulate the \n fight or flight response \n may also be implicated in the establishment of dominance hierarchies Field research has shown that higher ranking individuals tend to have much higher levels of circulating glucocorticoids compared to \n subdominant \n individuals within the hierarchy \n This is in stark opposition to the original suggestion stating that being subdominant was more stressful than being dominant within a hierarchy \n Two core hypotheses attempt to explain these unusual findings The first suggests that higher ranking individuals exert more \n energy \n and thus need higher levels of glucocorticoids to more readily mobilize \n glycogen \n stores for energy use \n This hypothesis is supported by research showing that when food availability is low \n cortisol \n levels tended to increase within the dominant male thus allowing increased glycogen \n metabolism \n and subsequent energy production \n The second hypothesis suggests that elevated \n stress hormones \n are a result of social factors within the hierarchy particularly when the hierarchy is in transition Proponents of this theory assert that when a hierarchy is unstable aggressive interaction and confrontations increase within the hierarchy As a result the dominant individual ends up fighting much more than when the hierarchy is stable and as consequence of the increased fighting glucocorticoids are elevated during this period Field studies of \n olive baboons \n in \n Kenyaseem \n to support this hypothesis as it has been observed that dominant individuals tended to have lower cortisol levels in a stable hierarchy than did subdominant individuals When the hierarchy shifted to being unstable however the dominant individual showed much higher levels of cortisol compared to subdominant individuals \n Many are quick to point out however that this is extremely unusual as dominant individuals rarely have low levels of glucocorticoids regardless of hierarchy state \n Nonetheless it appears that being dominant may not be as beneficial as previously thought since chronic levels of glucocorticoids can have a variety of adverse health effects including \n immunosuppression \n increased \n appetite \n osteoporosis \n etc see cortisol and perhaps is the reason why subdominant individuals are so reluctant to challenge the dominant individual for their position during hierarchy transitory periods \n In eusocial insects \n In \n insect societies \n only one to few individuals members of a colony can reproduce whereas the other colony members have their reproductive capabilities suppressed This conflict over reproduction in some cases results in a dominance hierarchy Dominant individuals in this case are known as queens and have the obvious advantage of performing reproduction and benefiting from all the tasks performed by their subordinates the worker caste foraging nest maintenance nest defense brood care and thermal regulation According to \n Hamilton's rule \n the reproduction costs of the worker caste are compensated by the contribution of workers to the queens reproductive success with which they share genes This is true not only to the popular social insects \n ants \n termites \n some \n bees \n and \n wasps \n but also for the \n naked mole-rat \n Heterocephalus glaber \n In a laboratory experiment Clarke and Faulkes \n demonstrated that reproductive status in a colony of \n H glaber \n was correlated with the individuals ranking position within a dominance hierarchy but aggression between potential reproductives only started after the queen was removed \n Social insects above mentioned excluding termites are \n haplodiploid \n Queen and workers are diploid but males develop from haploid genotypes In some species suppression of \n ovary \n development is not totally achieved in the worker caste which opens the possibility of reproduction by workers Since \n nuptial flights \n are seasonal and workers are wingless workers are almost always virgin and as \n gamergate \n ants or \n laying worker bees \n can only lay unfertilised eggs These eggs are in general viable developing into males A worker that perform reproduction is considered a 'cheater' within the colony because its success in leaving descendants becomes disproportionally larger compared to its sisters and mother The advantage of remaining functionally sterile is only accomplished if every worker assume this 'compromise' When one or more workers start reproducing the 'social contract' is destroyed and the colony cohesion is dissolved Aggressive behavior derived from this conflict may result in the formation of hierarchies and attempts of reproduction by workers are actively suppressed In some wasps such as \n Polistes fuscatus \n instead of not laying eggs the female workers begin being able to reproduce but once being under the presence of dominant females the subordinate female workers can no longer reproduce \n In some wasp species such as \n Liostenogaster flavolineata \n there are many possible Queens that inhabit a nest but only one can be queen at a time When a Queen dies the next Queen is selected by an age based dominance hierarchy This is also true in the species \n Polistes instabilis \n where the next queen is selected based on age rather than size \n Polistes exclamans \n also exhibits this type of hierarchy \n Within the dominance hierarchies of the \n Polistes versicolor \n however the dominant-subordinate context in the yellow paper wasps is directly related to the exchange of food Future foundresses within the nest compete over the shared resources of nourishment such as protein Unequal nourishment is often what leads to the size differences that result in dominant-subordinate position rankings Therefore if during the winter aggregate the female is able to obtain greater access to food the female could thus reach a dominant position \n In some species especially in ants more than one queen can be found in the same colony a condition called Polygyny In this case another advantage of maintaining a hierarchy is to prolong the colony lifespan The top ranked individuals may die or lose fertility and \"extra queens\" may benefit of starting a colony in the same site or nest This advantage is critical in some ecological contexts such as in situations where nesting sites are limited or dispersal of individuals is risky due to high rates of predation This polygynous behavior has also been observed in some eusocial bees such as \n Schwarziana quadripunctata \n In this species multiple queens of varying sizes are present The larger \n physogastric \n queens typically control the nest though a \"dwarf\" queen will take its place in the case of a premature death \n Regulatory mechanisms in eusocial organisms \n The suppression of reproduction by dominant individuals is the most common mechanism that maintains the hierarchy In eusocial mammals this is mainly achieved by aggressive interactions between the potential reproductive females In eusocial insects aggressive interactions between sexuals are common determinants of reproductive status such as in the \n bumblebee \n Bombus bifarius \n the \n paper wasp \n Polistes annularis \n and in the ants \n Dinoponera australis \n and \n D quadriceps \n In general aggressive interactions are ritualistic and involve antennation drumming abdomen curling and very rarely mandible bouts and stinging The winner of the interaction may walk over the subordinated that in turn assumes a prostrated posture on the substrate In order to be effective these regulatory mechanisms must include traits that make an individual rank position readily recognizable by its nestmates The composition of the lipid layer present on the \n cuticle \n of social insects is the clue used by nestmates to recognize each other in the colony and to discover each insect's reproductive status and therefore its rank \n Visual cues may also transmit the same information Paper wasps \n Polistes dominulus \n have individual \"facial badges\" that permit them to recognize each other and to identify the status of each individual \n Individuals whose badges were modified by painting were aggressively treated by their nestmates suggesting that advertising a false ranking status is a costly behavior suppressed in these wasps \n Other behaviors are involved in maintaining reproductive status in social insects The removal of a thoracic \n sclerite \n in \n Diacamma \n ants inhibits ovary development the only reproductive individual of this naturally queenless genus is the one that retains its sclerite intact This individual is called a \n gamergate \n and is responsible for mutilating all the newly emerged females to maintain its social status Gamergates of \n Harpegnathos saltator \n arise from aggressive interactions forming a hierarchy of potential reproductives \n In the \n honey bee \n Apis mellifera \n pheromone produced by the queen mandibular glands is responsible for inhibiting ovary development in the worker caste \n \" \n Worker policing \n \" is an additional mechanism that prevents reproduction by workers found in bees and ants Policing may involve oophagy and immobilization of egg-layers from the worker caste \n In some ant species such as the carpenter ant \n Camponotus floridanus \n eggs from queens have a peculiar chemical profile that workers can distinguish from worker laid eggs When worker-laid eggs are found they are eaten \n In some species such as \n Pachycondyla obscuricornis \n workers may try to escape policing by shuffling their eggs within the egg pile laid by the queen \n Female dominance in mammals \n Female-biased dominance occurs rarely in mammals and it is observed consistently in \n hyenas \n lemurs \n and the \n bonobo \n It is also observed in elephants It occurs when all adult males exhibit submissive behavior to adult females in social settings These social settings are usually related to feeding grooming and sleeping site priority \n There are three basic proposals for the evolution of female dominance \n The Energy Conservation Hypothesis males subordinate to females to conserve energy for intense male-male competition experienced during very short breeding seasons \n Male behavioral strategy males defer as a parental investment because it ensures more resources in a harsh unpredictable climate for the female and thus the male's future offspring \n Female behavioral strategy dominance helps females deal with the unusually high reproductive demands they prevail in more social conflicts because they have more at stake in terms of fitness \n Since these original proposals scientists like Peter Kappeler have modified and integrated other ideas However in the case of lemurs there is no single hypothesis that can fully explain female \n social dominance \n at this time and all three are likely to play a role \n citation needed \n Dominance in birds \n In \n dunnocks \n two or three males may share one or more females in a polyandrous or polygynandrous mating system This leads to the males' ranges to overlap so they would cooperate in order to defend the territory Among the males is a dominance hierarchy older birds tend to be the alpha male and first year birds are usually the beta males Studies have not found cases of close male relatives being involved in any mating combinations \n citation needed \n Dominance in fish \n Dominance hierarchies can also be observed in many fish For example in the \n dragonet \n males form hierarchies that are often exhibited during mating They can act extremely aggressively towards another male if it intrudes upon courtship and pairing with a female and fights can be very intense \n citation needed \n Evolution of intelligence

the dog to reliably respond to basic commands such as \"sit \" \"down \" \"come \" and \"stay \" to high level competition within clubs such as the \n American Kennel Club \n United Kennel Club \n and the \n Canadian Kennel Club \n where additional commands accuracy and performance are scored and judged \n Obedience implies compliance with the direction or command given by the handler For a dog to be considered obedient rather than simply trained in obedience it must respond reliably each time its handler gives a command \n German Shepherd \n Dog \n Training a dog in obedience can be an ongoing and lengthy process depending on the dog the methods used and the skill and understanding of both the trainer and the handler The level of obedience the handler wishes to achieve with the dog is also a major factor in the time involved as is the commitment to training by the handler \n Obedience training is often a prerequisite for or component of other training \n The actual training of the dog can be done by anyone the trainer owner or a friend Typically the individual who is caring for and living with the dog participates and trains the dog as they will be the one who will be giving the commands The relationship and trust between the dog and handler are important for success \n Basic or beginner's obedience is typically a short course ranging from six to ten weeks where it is demonstrated to the handler how to communicate with and train the dog in a few simple commands With most methods the dog is trained one command at a time Though there may or may not be a specific word attached to it walking properly on a leash or leash control is often the first training required prior to learning other commands \n Dog intelligence and training \n Commands \n Basic commands \n Advanced commands \n Training devices \n Collars \n Flat collar \n Slip collar \n Martingale collar \n Prong collars \n Electronic collars \n Other devices \n Leash \n Clicker \n Head halter \n Dog bite tug \n Competitive obedience \n Obedience for other purposes \n Working dogs \n have always learned to obey commands related to the work that they historically performed such as when a \n herding dog \n moves a flock of animals in response to a \n shepherd \n 's whistled directions or a hunting dog searching for or chasing down quarry or leaving the treed quarry at the hunter's command \n In the twentieth century formalized \n dog training \n originated in \n military \n and \n police \n applications and the methods used largely reflected the military approach to training humans In the middle and late part of the century however more research into \n operant conditioning \n and \n positive reinforcement \n occurred as \n wild animal shows \n became more popular Aquatic mammal trainers used \n clickers \n a small box that makes a loud click when pushed on to \"mark\" desired behavior giving food as a reward The change in training methods spread gradually into the world of \n dog training \n Today many dog trainers rely heavily on positive reinforcement to teach new behaviors \n At a basic level \n owners \n want \n dogs \n with which they can pleasantly share a house a car or a walk in the park Some dogs need only a minimum amount of training to learn to eliminate outside be \n housebroken \n to sit to lie down or to come on command obey a \n recall \n Many other dogs prove more challenging New dog owners might find training difficult and fail to make progress because they expect dogs to think and act like humans and are surprised and baffled when the dogs don't \n Dogs that demonstrate the previously mentioned basic skills as well as walking reasonably well on a \n leash \n and a few other minor tasks can be tested for and earn the \n American Kennel Club \n 's AKC \n Canine Good Citizen \n certification While not a competitive obedience title a CGC certification demonstrates that the dog is sociable well behaved and reliable in public settings \n Some insurance companies will waive breed restrictions on dogs with CGCs and many states have passed resolutions supporting and encouraging CGC certification as a yardstick for canine manners and responsible dog ownership \n Dog intelligence and training \n A \n White German Shepherd \n ready to obey \n Certain breeds such as \n Doberman Pinschers \n German Shepherds \n Border Collies \n Labrador Retrievers \n and \n Golden Retrievers \n have reputations as being easier to train than others such as some \n hounds \n and \n sled dogs \n Dogs that have been bred to perform one task to the exclusion of all others such as the \n Bloodhound \n or \n Husky \n or that have been bred to work independently from their handler such as \n terriers \n may be particularly challenging with obedience training \n Dog intelligence \n is exhibited in many different ways and a dog that might not be easy to train might nonetheless be quite adept at figuring out how to open kitchen cabinets or to escape from the yard Novice dog owners need to consider a dog's trainability as well as its energy level exercise requirements and other factors before choosing a new pet Very high intelligence is not necessarily a good thing in a companion dog as smart dogs can require extensive daily mental stimulation if they are not to become bored and destructive \n No breed is impossible to obedience train but novice owners might find training some breeds quite difficult The capacity to learn basic obedienceand even complicated behavioris inherent in all dogs Some breeds may require more patience or creativity in training than others Individual dogs that exhibit fearful or anxious behaviors should also be handled with greater care and especially not trained using harsh corrective methods as this training can be psychologically harmful to the dog and result in further behavioral issues \n Commands \n The specific command word is not important but consistency in usage is There are certain commands that are accepted as standard and commonly used \n Basic commands \n Sit \n The dog is in a sitting position \n Down \n A dog is typically down when its elbows front feet and hocks rear legs are touching the ground or floor \n Heel \n The dog's head or shoulder is parallel to the handler's leg on the left side of the handler \n Come \n or \n Here \n referred to as the \n recall \n \"Call your dog\" equals \"come\" or \"here\" \n Stay \n The dog must remain in the position sit down stand and location under which the command was given until it is released by the handler \n Stand \n While the dog is sitting by your side at heel hold your treat in your fingers lure the dog forward Praise the dog once they move forward into a \n stand \n Advanced commands \n Stop \n a dog that will simply stop whatever it is doing and lie down on command no matter how far it is from its keeper is a dog that can be taken anywhere \n Back up \n keepers of large dogs or dogs with a reputation for aggressiveness can make strangers more comfortable by teaching the dog to back up on command \n Growl \n the inverse of backing up Some owners teach non-aggressive dogs to growl on a subtle command not the word \n growl \n usually a small hand gesture as a way of letting strangers know that you and your dog value being left alone \n Shake \n Directs the dog to shake whole body Generally used after bathing or swimming to prevent dog from soaking owner \n Shake Hands \n or \n Shake \n Directs dog to lift paw and place it in the hand of the owner as if shaking hands \n Steady \n keep near by The dog can walk free but not dash off \n Stand \n dog stands still Useful for grooming Many dogs are groomed frequently and need to stand quietly during the process \n Go to bed \n kennel \n or \n get in \n Directs the dog to go to its bed or its \n crate \n and to remain there until released The dog has freedom of movement in that location to stand up turn around or lie down unlike when placed in a \n Stay \n Useful to keep a dog out from underfoot and safe in a busy or complicated situation \n Drop \n or \n drop it \n Dogs pick up all sorts of things some of which they shouldn't have A dog that drops anything on command no matter how attractive and \"attractive\" to a dog can be \"rotten and smelly\" to a human is a dog under control that the owner can prevent from eating dangerous items or from destroying valued personal property \n Leave it \n An adjunct to \n Drop \n directing the dog to not touch an item Also useful before the dog has picked anything up \n Leave it \n is also used in conjunction with \n Take it \n Take it \n The dog leaves a desired object such as a toy or treat untouched until given this command Alternatively the dog takes and holds an object which it has no interest in This can protect an owner's visitor's or child's fingers \n Give \n The dog has an object in its mouth and \"gives\" it to its owner by releasing the object into the owner's hand Object of choice in training is usually a light-weight dumbbell or a glove This is useful for when your dog has one of your belongings and you want it back before the dog hides it or chews it up \n Speak \n A dog when taught this command will bark once or more when told to do so \n Roll Over \n When taught this command a dog will lie down roll over and stand back up \n Attack \n A dog will attack something or someone when told to do so Common commands are either \"Attack\" or \"Sic'em\" \n Fetch \n A dog will retrieve a thrown object usually a ball or a stick and bring it back to the one who threw it \n Place \n The dog is trained to go to a certain place and stay there until released usually a place in the house selected by owner \n With me \n used when walking your dog to keep them at your side and with your pace \n Training devices \n Collars \n Dog collar \n Flat collar \n Flat collars are commonly used in \n clicker training \n and other non-correction-based training such as puppy kindergarten They are also effective in training small dogs however they tend to lift the dog off the ground when giving corrections while the dog is distracted or in high adrenal mode They are typically made of nylon or leather and fasten with a buckle or quick-release connection \n Slip collar \n Slip collars commonly called \n choke chain \n or check chains are made of metal links or rolled material such as nylon or leather A metal ring is at each end Historically slip collars have been used as a matter of course mostly in North America and the UK In the last few decades use of these collars has declined Correctly used the collar should make a quick clicking not zipping sound when quickly snapped and released to startle or get the attention of the dog and indicate to the handler that the technique was a swift jerk not a choke The idea is not to strangle the dog though this can happen if the collar is improperly used \n Martingale collar \n Martingale collars also called limited-slip collars are usually made of flat nylon with a smaller fixed-length section made of either nylon or a short length of chain that when pulled on by the leash shortens up tightening the collar around the dog's neck to a limited extent When properly fitted martingales are looser than flat-buckle collars when not tightened and less severely corrective than slip collars when tightened \n Prong collars \n Prong collars also called 'pinch collars' are a series of chain links with blunted open ends turned towards the dog's neck The design of the prong collar is such that it has a limited circumference unlike slip collars which do not have a limit on how far they can constrict on a dog's neck The limited traction of the martingale chain combined with the angle of the prongs prevents the prongs moving close enough to pinch The collar is designed to prevent the dog from pulling by applying pressure at each point against the dog's neck \n Prong collars must never be turned inside out with the prongs facing away from the dog's skin as this may cause injury against the body and head \n Plastic tips are occasionally placed on the ends of the prongs to protect against tufts forming in the fur or in the case of low quality manufactured collars with rough chisel cut ends puncturing the skin Like the slip collar the prong collar is placed high on the dog's neck just behind the ears at the most sensitive point \n Some dogs can free themselves from prong collars with large wire looped sides by shaking their head so that the links pop out so some trainers have come to use a second collar usually an oversize slip collar in addition to the prong collar so when this happens the dog does not run loose \n Electronic collars \n Electronic collars \n also known as E-collars transmit a remote signal from a control device the handler operates to the collar An electrical impulse is transmitted by the handler remotely at varying degrees of intensity from varying distances depending on range frequency It is also done automatically in the bark electronic collar to stop excessive barking and invisible fence collar when the dog strays outside its boundary Electronic collars are widely used in some areas of the world and by some dog obedience professionals This technique remains a source of controversy with many dog training associations veterinary associations and kennel clubs \n Other devices \n Leash \n Leash \n The leash or lead is used to connect the dog to the handler lead the dog as well as to control the dog in urban areas Most communities have laws which prohibit dogs from running at large They may be made of any material such as nylon metal or leather A six-foot length is commonly used for walking and in training classes though leashes come in lengths both shorter and longer A long line also called a lunge line can be metres ten feet or more in length and are often used to train the dog to come when called from a distance \n Clicker \n Clicker \n The clicker is a small hand-held device that makes a distinct short sound to \n mark \n a desired behavior See \n clicker training \n for a more detailed discussion of this methodology It has gained popularity in recent years as being a means of training that does not involve physically correcting the dog though it may be used in conjunction with these methods \n Head halter \n Dog collar \n Head halters are an alternative to collars that works similarly to a horse halter The halter fits over the dog's snout and behind its head leading it to sometimes be mistaken for a muzzle Halters reduce the dog's ability to successfully pull on the leash but do not eliminate it If the halter is used with a sharp jerk on the leash neck injury to the dog may result but used correctly head halters have not been shown to cause harm \n Dog bite tug \n Dog bite tug \n Dog training bite tug is a tool usually used as retrieve developing skills It is used for police military and Schutzhund dog training Bite tugs are perfect for puppies but can be used for training adult dogs as well \n Competitive obedience \n This \n Smooth Collie \n retrieves an obedience dumbbell made of wood others are made of metal \n obedience trial \n For dog owners who enjoy competition and relish the opportunity to work as a highly tuned team with their dogs competitive \n obedience trials \n are available Dogs can earn obedience titles including an obedience championship \n In competition merely sitting lying down or walking on a leash are insufficient The dog and handler must perform the activities off leash and in a highly stylized and carefully defined manner For example on a recall the dog must come directly to the handler without sniffing or veering to one side and must sit straight in front of the handler not at an angle or off to one side or the other Training for obedience competitions builds on basic obedience training \n The \n United Kennel Club \n UKC the \n Australian National Kennel Council \n ANKC the \n American Kennel Club \n AKC and the Australian Shepherd Dog Club of America ASCA are some of the organizations which offer titles in Competition Obedience \n AKC obedience titles include Companion Dog CD Companion Dog Excellent CDX Utility Dog UD Utility Dog Excellent UDX and Obedience Trial Champion OTCH \n In recent years a new form of Obedience competition known as \n Rally Obedience \n has become very popular It was originally devised by Charles L \"Bud\" Kramer from the obedience practice of \"doodling\" - doing a variety of interesting warmup and freestyle exercises Rally Obedience is designed to be a \"bridge\" or intermediate step between the CGC certification and traditional Obedience competition \n Unlike regular obedience instead of waiting for the judge's orders the competitors proceed around a course of designated stations with the dog in heel position The course consists of to signs that instruct the team what to do Unlike traditional obedience handlers are allowed to encourage their dogs during the course \n Obedience for other purposes \n There are many reasons for training dogs beyond the level required for basic companionship For example \n assistance dogs \n must obey their \"sit\" and \"down\" commands perfectly at all times but they do not have to conform to the rigid rules of competitive obedience \n Dogs competing in \n dog sports \n such as \n flyball \n agility \n or \n Schutzhund \n must be trusted in an open field off leash and surrounded by other people dogs \n hot dogs \n and \n flying discs \n This requires more focused attention on the owner and a better recall than that found in most household companion dogs and more advanced training than that required for

behaviors when asked to do so by humans Horses are trained to be manageable by humans for everyday care as well as for \n equestrian \n activities from \n horse racing \n to \n therapeutic horseback riding \n for people with disabilities \n Historically horses were trained for \n warfare \n farm \n work sport and transport Today most horse training is geared toward making horses useful for a variety of recreational and sporting equestrian pursuits Horses are also trained for specialized jobs from movie stunt work to police and crowd control activities circus entertainment and equine-assisted psychotherapy \n There is tremendous controversy over various methods of horse training and even some of the words used to describe these methods Some techniques are considered cruel other methods are considered gentler and more humane However it is beyond the scope of this article to go into the details of various training methodology so general basic principles are described below The \n see also \n section of this article provides links to more specific information about various schools and techniques of horse training \n Goals \n Stages \n Training of foals and younger horses \n Ground training \n \"Backing\" or riding the young horse \n Training for a specific discipline \n Notes \n Goals \n Effective communication and harmony between horse and rider are among the goals of proper training \n The range of training techniques and training goals is large but basic \n animal training \n concepts apply to all forms of horse training The initial goal of most types of training is to create a horse that is safe for humans to handle under most circumstances and able to perform a useful task for the benefit of humans \n A few specific considerations and some basic knowledge of \n horse behavior \n helps a horse trainer be effective no matter what school or discipline is chosen \n Safety is paramount Horses are much larger and stronger than humans so must be taught behavior that will not injure people \n Horses like other animals differ in brain structure from humans and thus do not have the same type of thinking and reasoning ability as human beings Thus the human has the responsibility to think about how to use the \n psychology of the horse \n to lead the animal into an understanding of the goals of the human trainer \n Horses are social herd animals and when properly handled can learn to follow and respect a human leader \n Horses as prey animals have an inborn \n fight or flight \n instinct that has to be adapted to human needs Horses need to be taught to rely upon humans to determine when fear or flight is an appropriate response to new stimuli and not to react by \n instinct \n alone \n Like most animals a young horse will more easily adapt to human expectations than an older one so human handling of the horse from a very early age is generally advised \n Stages \n Regardless of the goal of training most horses go through a predictable series of steps on their way to being \"finished\" animals for a given discipline \n Training of foals and younger horses \n Most young domesticated horses are handled at birth or within the first few days of life though some are only handled for the first time when they are weaned from their \n mothers or \n dams \n Advocates of handling \n foals \n from birth sometimes use the concept of \n imprinting \n to introduce a foal within its first few days and weeks of life to many of the activities they will see throughout their lives Within a few hours of birth a foal being imprinted will have a human touch it all over pick up its feet and introduce it to human touch and voice \n Others may leave a foal alone for its first few hours or days arguing that it is more important to allow the foal to bond with its dam However even people who do not advocate imprinting often still place value on handling a foal a great deal while it is still nursing and too small to easily overpower a human By doing so the foal ideally will learn that humans will not harm it but also that humans must be respected \n Horses too young to be ridden are trained to accept a halter taught basic skills manners and become accustomed to human activity Some like this \n yearling \n are shown in conformation classes \n While a foal is far too young to be ridden it is still able to learn skills it will need later in life By the end of a foal's first year it should be \n halter-broke \n meaning that it allows a \n halter \n placed upon its head and has been taught to be led by a human at a walk and trot to stop on command and to stand tied \n The young horse needs to be calm for basic \n grooming \n as well as \n veterinary \n care such as \n vaccinations \n and de-worming A foal needs regular \n hoof \n care and can be taught to stand while having its feet picked up and trimmed by a \n farrier \n Ideally a young horse should learn all the basic skills it will need throughout its life including being caught from a field loaded into a \n horse trailer \n and not to fear flapping or noisy objects It also can be exposed to the noise and commotion of ordinary human activity including seeing motor vehicles hearing radios and so on More advanced skills sometimes taught in the first year include learning to accept \n blankets \n placed on it to be trimmed with electric clippers and to be given a bath with water from a hose The foal may learn basic voice commands for starting and stopping and sometimes will learn to square its feet up for showing in \n in-hand or conformation \n classes If these tasks are completed the young horse will have no fear of things placed on its back around its belly or in its mouth \n Some people whether through philosophy or simply due to being pressed for time do not handle foals significantly while they are still nursing but wait until the foal is \n weaned \n from its dam to begin halter breaking and the other tasks of training a horse in its first year The argument for gentling and halter-breaking at weaning is that the young horse in crisis from being separated from its dam will more readily bond with a human at weaning than at a later point in its life Sometimes the tasks of basic gentling are not completed within the first year but continue when the horse is a \n yearling \n Yearlings are larger and more unpredictable than weanlings plus often are easily distracted in part due to the first signs of sexual maturity However they also are still highly impressionable and though very quick and agile are not at their full adult strength \n Rarer but not uncommon even in the modern world is the practice of leaving young horses completely unhandled until they are old enough to be ridden usually between the age of two and four and completing all ground training as well as training for riding at the same time However waiting until a horse is full grown to begin training is often far riskier for humans and requires considerably more skill to avoid injury \n Ground training \n A young horse in Europe being longed with a surcingle and side reins \n After a young horse is taught to lead and other basic skills various tasks can be introduced to the horse as it matures while it is still too young to be ridden Some schools of training do a great deal of work with young horses during their yearling and two-year-old years to prepare them for riding others merely reinforce the basic lessons taught to the horse as a foal and simply keep the horse accustomed to the presence of humans Many times a young horse did not have all necessary basic skills described above taught to it as a foal and its \"adolescent\" years are spent learning or re-learning basic lessons \n Several ground training techniques are commonly introduced to a young horse some time after it is a year old but prior to being ridden All horses usually have some or all of this ground work done prior to being ridden though the time spent can range from hours to months While a \n foal \n or \n yearling \n can be introduced to a small amount of ground work a young horse's bones and joints are quite soft and fragile So to prevent joint and \n cartilage \n injury intense work particularly intense work in a confined circle such as advanced roundpenning or \n longeing \n should wait until the horse is at least two years old Common ground training techniques include \n Liberty \n work sometimes called \n free longeing \n round pen work \n or \n roundpenning \n but regardless of terminology is the process of working a loose horse in a small area usually a \n round pen \n feet/1520 meters in diameter with the handler holding only a long whip or a rope lariat teaching the horse to respond to the voice and body language of the handler as he or she asks the horse to move faster or slower to change direction and to stop \n Longeing \n Lungeing- UK pronounced \"lungeing\" the training of a young horse to move in circles at the end of a long rope or line usually about to feet long \n Desensitization \n sometimes called \n sacking out \n the process of introducing a horse to flapping objects such as blankets teaching the horse to allow itself to be touched by an object and not to fear things that people move about a horse \n Introduction to a \n saddle \n and \n bridle \n or \n harness \n without actually getting on the horse or hooking up a cart \n Ground driving also called long-lining teaching a young horse to move forward with a person walking behind it a precursor to both \n harness driving \n and having \n reins \n used by a mounted rider \n Bitting \n the process of accustoming a horse to a \n bit \n and \n bridle \n sometimes with the addition of \n side reins \n that attach to a saddle harness or \n surcingle \n a wide leather or nylon band that goes around the horse's barrel and accustom the horse to the feel of pressure on the bit \n A horse is not ready to be ridden until it is accustomed to all the equipment that it needs to wear and is responsive to basic voice and usually rein commands to start stop turn and change \n gaits \n For some disciplines ground work is also used to develop specific types of muscling as well as to instill certain behaviors When ground work incorporates both mental and muscular development it may take considerably longer for the horse to be ready to be ridden but advocates of these methods maintain that the additional time on the ground allows the horse to advance more quickly or with better manners once under saddle \n \"Backing\" or riding the young horse \n A young \n Lipizzan \n at the \n Spanish Riding School \n in training equipment wearing \n saddle \n bridle \n and longeing \n cavesson \n so that it may be \n longed \n prior to being ridden \n The age that horses are first ridden or \"backed\" UK varies considerably by breed and discipline Many \n Thoroughbred \n race horses have small light riders on their backs as early as the fall of their yearling year Most stock horse breeds such as the \n American Quarter Horse \n are ridden at the age of two Most horses used in harness have a cart first put behind them at age two and even some horses not ridden until age three will be trained to pull a light cart at two in order to learn better discipline and to help develop stronger muscles with less stress The vast majority of horses across disciplines and throughout the world are first put under saddle at the age of three However some slower-maturing breeds such as the \n Lipizzan \n are not ridden until the age of four \n The act of getting on a horse for the first time goes by many names including \n backing breaking mounting \n and simply \n riding \n There are many techniques for introducing the young horse to a rider or to a harness and cart for driving but the end goal of all methods is to have the horse calmly and quietly allow a rider on its back or behind it in a cart and to respond to basic commands to go forward change \n gaits \n and speed stop turn and back up \n Ideally a young horse will have no fear of humans and view being ridden as simply one more new lesson A properly handled young horse that had adequate ground work will seldom buck rear or run away when it is ridden even for the very first time \n Discipline-specific training can take years to perfect \n Horses that have never been taught to be ridden can learn at any age though it may take somewhat longer to teach an older horse An older horse that is used to humans but has no prior bad habits is easier to put under saddle than is a completely \n feral horse \n caught \"wild\" off the \n open range \n as an adult However an adult feral horse may be easier to train than a domesticated animal that has previously learned to treat humans with disrespect \n Training for a specific discipline \n There are many horse training philosophies and techniques and details are far too extensive to describe in a single article Also horses have different conformation athletic potential temperaments and personalities all of which may influence what techniques are used For further information on

personality psychology \n certain \n personality disorders \n display characteristics involving the need to gain compliance or control over others \n Those with \n antisocial personality disorder \n tend to display a glibness and \n grandiose \n sense of \n self-worth \n Due to their \n shallow affect \n and lack of \n remorse \n or \n empathy \n they are well suited to con and/or \n manipulate \n others into complying with their wishes \n Those with \n histrionic personality disorder \n need to be the \n center of attention \n and in turn draw people in so they may use and eventually dispose of their relationship \n Those with \n narcissistic personality disorder \n have an inflated self-importance hypersensitivity to \n criticism \n and a sense of \n entitlement \n that compels them to persuade others to comply with their requests \n Social psychologists view compliance as a means of social influence used to reach \n goals \n and attain social or personal gains Rather than concentrating on an individual's personality or characteristics that may drive their actions social psychology focuses on people as a whole and how thoughts feelings and behaviors allow individuals to attain compliance and/or make them vulnerable to complying with the demands of others Their gaining of or submission to compliance is frequently influenced by \n construals \n i e an individual's interpretation of their social environment and interactions \n Major theoretical approaches \n The study of compliance is often recognized for the overt demonstrations of dramatic experiments such as the Stanford prison experiment and the Stanley Milgram shock experiments These experiments served as displays of the psychological phenomena of compliance Such compliance frequently occurred in response to overt social forces and while these types of studies have provided useful insight into the nature of compliance today's researchers are inclined to concentrate their efforts on subtle indirect and/or unconscious social influences \n Those involved in this modern social-cognitive movement are attempting to discover the ways in which subjects' implicit and explicit beliefs opinions and goals affect information processing and decision making in settings where influential forces are present \n Philosophy vs social psychology \n Philosophers view compliance in the context of \n arguments \n Arguments are produced when an individual gives a reason for thinking that a claim is true In doing so they utilize premises claims to support their conclusion opinion Regardless of utilization of fallacy forms i e \n apple-polishing \n ad hominem \n to get their point across individuals engaged in philosophical arguments are overtly and logically expressing their opinion s This is an explicit action in which the person on the other side of the argument recognizes that the arguer seeks to gain compliance acceptance of their conclusion \n In studying compliance social psychologists aim to examine overt and subtle social influences experienced in various forms by all individuals Implicit and explicit psychological processes are also studied since they shape interactions This is because these processes explain how certain individuals can make another comply and why someone else succumbs to compliance \n As a means of fulfilling needs \n In complying with the requests of others and/or by following their actions we seek to maintain the goals of social influence \n informative social influence \n normative social influence \n Informative social influence goal of accuracy \n People are motivated to achieve their goals in the most efficient and accurate manner possible When faced with information an individual needs to correctly interpret and reactparticularly when faced with compliance-gaining attempts since an inaccurate behavior could result in great loss With that being said people attempt to gain an accurate \n construal \n of their situation so they may respond accordingly \n Individuals are frequently rewarded for acting in accordance with the beliefs suggestions and commands of \n authority \n figures and/or social norms Among other sources authority may be gained on the basis of societal power setting and size Individuals are likely to comply with an authority figure's or group's orders or replicate the actions deemed correct by social norms because of an assumption that the individual is unaware of some important information The need to be accurateand the belief that others know something they do notoften supersedes the individual's personal opinion \n Normative social influence goal of affiliation \n Humans are fundamentally motivated by the need to belongthe need for social approval through the maintenance of meaningful \n social relationships \n This need motivates people to engage in behavior that will induce the approval of their peers People are more likely to take actions to cultivate relationships with individuals they like and/or wish to gain approval from By complying with others' requests and abiding by norms of \n social exchange \n i e the \n norm of reciprocity \n individuals adhere to normative social influence and attain the goal of affiliation \n An example of both normative and informational social influence is the \n Solomon Asch line experiments \n As a product of variables \n Bibb Latan \n originally proposed the \n social impact theory \n that consists of three principles and provides wide-ranging rules that govern these individual processes The general theory suggests we think of social impact as the result of social forces operating in a social structure Latan The theory's driving principles can make directional predictions regarding the effects of strength immediacy and number on compliance however the principles are not capable of specifying precise outcomes for future events \n Strength \n The stronger a groupthe more important it is to an individualthe more likely that individual is to comply with social influence \n Immediacy \n The proximity of the group makes an individual more likely to conform and comply with the group's pressures These pressures are strongest when the group is closer to the individual and composed of people the individual cares about i e friends family and/or authority figures \n Number \n Researches have found that compliance increases as the number of people in the group increases however once the group reaches or people compliance is less likely to occur After this point each additional person has less of an influencing effect However adding more members to a small group i e to people has a greater effect than adding more members to a larger group i e to people Aronson \n Similarity \n Although this variable is not included in Latan's theory Burger et al conducted studies that examined the effect of similarity and compliance to a request Note that the shared characteristic i e birthday first name had to be perceived as incidental The findings demonstrated that people were more likely to comply with the requester when they believed the feature they shared was unplanned and rare \n Displayed by the SIFT-3M model \n This depiction of the SIFT-3M Model highlights the psychological steps involved in gaining or succumbing to compliance \n A theoretical approach uncommon in major psychology literature is David Straker's SIFT-3M model It was created to discuss mental functioning in relation to psychological decisions i e compliance Straker proposes that by gaining a greater understanding of how people make sense of the world how they think and how they decide to act people can develop the basic tools needed to change others' minds by gaining compliance In inducing compliance requestors must understand the stages or levels \n sensing \n inferring meaning \n formatting intent \n translating intent into action \n memory \n motivators \n musing \n state \n inner and outer worlds \n In using this model to understand and change the minds of others Straker reminds requestors that they must talk to the other individual's internal map thoughts and beliefs and familiarize themselves with their inner systems \n Gaining techniques \n The following techniques have been proven to effectively induce compliance from another party \n Foot-in-the-door \n Foot-in-the-door technique \n In utilizing this technique the subject is asked to perform a small requesta favor that typically requires minimal involvement After this a larger request is presented According to successive approximations because the subject complied with initial requests he or she is more likely to feel obligated to fulfill additional favors \n Door-in-the-face \n Door-in-the-face technique \n This technique begins with an initial grand request This request is expected to be turned down thus it is followed by a second more reasonable request This technique is decidedly more effective than foot-in-the-door since foot-in-the-door utilizes a gradual escalation of requests \n Low-ball \n Low-ball \n Frequently employed by car salesmen low-balling gains compliance by offering the subject something at a lower price only to increase the price at the last moment The buyer is more likely to comply with this price change since he or she feels like a mental agreement to a contract has occurred \n Ingratiation \n Ingratiation \n This attempt to obtain compliance involves gaining someone's approval so they will be more likely to appease your demands \n Edward E Jones \n discusses three forms of ingratiation \n flattery \n opinion conformity and \n self-presentation \n presenting one's own attributes in a manner that appeals to the target \n Norm of reciprocity \n Norm of reciprocity \n This technique explains that due to the injunctive social norm that people will return a favor when one is granted to them compliance is more likely to occur when the requestor has previously complied with one of the subject's requests \n Major empirical findings \n Solomon Asch line experiments \n Asch conformity experiments \n An example of the line test given to experiment participants \n In \n Solomon Asch's \n experiment participants were placed in separate ambiguous situations to determine the extent to which they would conform Aside from a single participant the other experiment members were confederatesindividuals who understood the aim of the study and had been instructed to produce pre-selected responses In the designated room a picture of three lines of differing lengths was displayed Each confederate was asked questions i e which line is the longest which line matches the reference line In response confederates gave largely incorrect answers \n Results \n As a result 1/3 of the participants gave the incorrect answer when the confederates produced unanimously incorrect answer s In accordance to the \n Goals of \n Social Influence \n participants claimed that even when they knew the unanimous answer was wrong they felt the group knew something they did not informational social influence Asch noted that 74% of subjects conformed to the majority at least once The rate of conformity was reduced when one or more confederates provided the correct answer and when participants were allowed to write down their responses rather than verbally stating them \n Significance \n The results of these studies support the notion that people comply to fulfill the need to be accurate and the need to belong Additionally it supports the social impact theory in that the experiment's ability to produce compliance was strengthened by its status confederates seen as informational authorities proximity and group size \n Stanley Milgram's experiment \n Milgram experiment \n Stanley Milgram's \n experiment set out to provide an explanation for the horrors being committed against Jewish individuals trapped in German \n concentration camps \n The compliance to authority demonstrated by people working in concentration camps ignited the question Are Germans actually evil' or is it possible to make anyone to comply to the orders of an authority figure? To test this Stanley Milgram designed an experiment to see if participants would harm shock another individual due to the need to comply with authority Milgram developed a pseudo-shock generator with labels beginning at volts Slight Shock to volts XXX Participants took on the role of teacher and were informed they would be participating in a learning and memory test In doing so they had to teach the student a confederate in a separate room a list of words The teacher was instructed to increase the voltage by and shock the student each time he answered incorrectly When a subject began to grow uneasy about shocking the confederate due to voltage level noises ethics etc the experimenter would encourage the participant to continue by proclaiming he would assume full responsibility for any harm done to the student and by saying phrases such as It is absolutely essential that you continue To rule out sadistic tendencies all teachers were male and were screened for competence and intelligence before beginning the experiment \n Results \n 100% of male participants delivered up to volts Intense to their assigned student 62% of participants administered volts Strong Shock and 63% participants shocked their student at the maximum level volts \n When these alterations to the original experiment were made the rate of compliance was \n not \n reduced \n The victim claimed to have a heart condition \n Subjects were told the experiment was being conducted for marketing purposes \n Before the experiment began the student extracted an explicit agreement from the teacher to stop on demand \n The rate of compliance \n was \n reduced when \n Two experimenters conducting the experiment disagreed about the teacher continuing \n Fellow teachers refused to continue in experiments with multiple teachers \n Experimenter remained in a different room from the teacher \n The teacher was instructed to hold the student's hand on a shock plate \n Significance \n The ordinary people who shocked the victim did so out of a sense of obligationan impression of his duties as a subjectand not from any peculiarly aggressive tendencies \n Stanley Milgram \n The results of Stanley Milgram's experiments indicate the power of informational and normative aspects of social influence Participants believed the experimenter was in control and held information he personally did not \"Teachers\" also showed a need for affiliation since they appeared to fear deviating from the experimenter's commands Additionally authoritative figures appear to have a large impact on the actions of individuals As previously stated individuals seeking affiliation and approval are more likely to comply with authority figures' demands \n Stanford prison experiment \n Stanford prison experiment \n This experiment was conducted to test social influence and compliance to authority through the utilization of a prison life situation After answering a local newspaper ad calling for volunteers for a study centered on the effects of prison life applications were checked for psychological problems medical disabilities and crime/drug abuse history and reduced to American and Canadian college students from the Stanford area The all-male participant pool was divided into two groups guards and prisoners by flipping a coin The prison was constructed by boarding up both sides of a corridor in the basement of Stanford's psychology department building The Yard was the only place were prisoners were allowed to walk eat or exerciseactions that were done blindfolded so they could not identify an exit Prison cells were located in laboratory rooms where the doors had been removed and replaced with steel bars and cell numbers \n The incarcerated individuals believed they were being kept in the Stanford County Jail because before the experiment began they did not know they would be labeled prisoners On a random day prisoners were subjected to an authentic police arrest Cars arrived at the station and suspects were brought inside where they were booked read their Miranda rights a second time finger printed and taken to a holding cells where they were left blindfolded Each prisoner received chains around their ankles and a stocking to simulate a shaved head Additionally inmates lost their names and were subsequently referred to by their ID number \n Results \n As the experiment progressed participants assigned to guard positions escalated their aggression Although guards were instructed not to hit the prisoners they found ways to \n humiliate \n /disrupt them via systematic searches strip searches spraying for lice \n sexual harassment \n denying them of basic rights i e bathroom use and waking inmates from their sleep for head counts Social and moral values initially held by the guards were quickly abandoned as they became immersed in their role \n Due to the reality of \n psychological abuse \n prisoners were released days later after exhibiting pathological behavior and nervous breakdowns \n Significance \n The Stanford Prison Project \n is a strong example of the power perceived authority can have over others In this case the \n authority \n was largely perceived however the consequences were real Due to the assumed power held by the guards even the good guards felt helpless to intervene Additionally none of the guards came late for a shift called in sick demanded extra pay for overtime or requested to be discharged from the study before its conclusion The guards complied with the alleged demands of the prison while the prisoners complied with the perceived authority of the guards Aside from certain instances of rebellion the prisoners were largely compliant with the guards ordersfrom strip searches to numerous nightly bed-checks \n \"The Experiment\"a filmtells a version of the Stanford Prison Project It focuses on men who are chosen/paid to participate in an experiment After being assigned the roles of guards and prisoners the psychological study spirals out of control \n Applications \n Person-to-person interactions \n The use of persuasion to achieve compliance has numerous applications in interpersonal interactions One party can utilize persuasion techniques to elicit a preferred response from other individuals Compliance strategies exploit psychological processes in order to prompt a desired outcome however they do not necessarily lead to private acceptance by the targeted individual \n Meaning an individual may comply with a request without truly believing the action s they are being asked to complete is acceptable Because of this persuasion techniques are often used one-sidedly in immediate situations where one individual wishes to provoke a specific response from another individual For example car salesmen frequently use the \n lowball \n technique to manipulate customers' psychological functioning by convincing them to comply with a request By initially estimating a car's price to be lower than actuality car salesmen recognize that the customer is more likely to accept a higher price at a later time Compliance strategies i e lowball foot-in-the-door etc are relevant to numerous person-to-person interactions when persuasion is involved \n One individual can use such techniques to gain compliance from the other swayed person Other practical examples include \n A child asking for an allowance raise with the foot-in-the-door technique \n A student using ingratiation i e flattery to ask for a raised grade \n An individual doing someone a favor hoping that the norm of reciprocity will influence that someone to lend a hand at a later date \n A lawyer using ingratiation and his or her perceived authority to persuade a jury \n Marketing \n This graph depicts the effectiveness of compliance techniques in relation to \n solicitation \n Research has indicated that compliance techniques have become a major asset to numerous forms of \n advertising \n including Internet shopping sites Techniques are used to communicate essential information intended to persuade customers \n Advertisements and other forms of marketing typically play on the customers' need for informative and normative social influence The people in the advertisements and the ads themselves serve as a type of authority They are credibleespecially in regards to the product As a result customers' need to be accurate drives them to comply with the ad's message and to purchase a product that an authority claims he or she needs Secondly people have the need to belong Customers often comply with ads by purchasing certain merchandise in the hopes of affiliating with a particular group Because compliance techniques play at psychological needs they are frequently successful in selling a product the use of fear is often less persuasive \n Controversies \n While there is some debate over the idea and power of compliance as a whole the main controversystemming from the subject of complianceis that people are capable of abusing persuasion techniques in order to gain advantages over other individuals Based on the psychological processes of social influence compliance strategies may enable someone to be more easily persuaded towards a particular belief or action even if he or she does not privately accept it \n As such the employment of compliance techniques may be utilized to manipulate an individual without their conscious recognition A specific issue regarding this controversy has arisen during courtroom proceedings Studies have shown that lawyers frequently implement these techniques in order to favorably influence a jury For example a prosecutor might use ingratiation to flatter a jury or cast an impression of his authority In such cases compliance strategies may be unfairly affecting the outcome of trials which ought to be based on hard facts and justice not simply persuasiveness \n Conclusion \n Compliance refers to an implicit or explicit response to a request Based in the roots of social influence compliance is studied through the use of many different approaches contexts and techniques The implications of compliance from a psychological standpoint infer that by utilizing various techniques i e foot-in-the-door ingratiation etc personal needs i e informational and social goals and/or group characteristics i e strength immediacy number It is important to recognize that people are capable of using or abusing compliance in order to gain advantage over others This has caused controversy in a number of settings and is still being looked at in depth in order to better understand how to use this social phenomenon in a prosocial manner \n Looking forward \n Social psychologist Laura Brannon is currently working on integrating social influence research into a number of different areas such as food and safety health and underage drinking \n Jerry Burger is currently doing research on how a unique opportunity is perceived with regards to compliance \n Robert Cialdini is examining how cultural factors come into play with persuasion and compliance \n Authority bias \n Codependency \n Coercive power \n Forced

filial piety The term can also be applied to general \n obedience \n Filial piety is central to Confucian \n role ethics \n In more general terms filial \n piety \n means to be good to one's parents to take care of one's parents to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors to perform the duties of one's job

Twenty-four Filial Exemplars \n Ershi-si xiao \n These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs filial piety has been common to almost all of them historian Hugh D R Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese believers \n Etymology \n Cultural significance \n Confucianism \n

Bibliography \n Etymology \n Filial piety is illustrated by the \n Chinese character \n xiao \n The character is a combination of the character \n lao \n old above the character \n zi \n son that is an elder being carried by a son \n In \n Korean Confucianism \n the character \n is pronounced \n hyo \n In Vietnamese the character \n is written in \n Quoc Ngu \n as hiu In Japanese the term is generally used in spoken and written language as \"oyakk \" adding characters for \"parent\" and \"conduct\" to make the word more specific \n Cultural significance \n Confucianism \n Illustrations of the Ladies' Classic of Filial Piety \n detail \n Song Dynasty \n depicting the section \"Serving One's Parents-in-Law\" \n According to the \n Classic of Filial Piety \n Confucius once said \"In serving his parents a filial son reveres them in daily life he makes them happy while he nourishes them he takes anxious care of them in sickness he shows great sorrow over their death that was for him and he sacrifices to them with solemnity \" \n For Confucius filial piety was not merely blind loyalty to one's parents More important than the norms of \n xio \n were the norms of \n rn \n benevolence \n and \n y \n righteousness \n For Confucius and \n Mencius \n xio \n was a display of \n rn \n which was ideally applied in one's dealings with all elders thus making it a general norm of intergenerational relations However in practice \n xio \n was usually reserved for one's own parents and grandparents and from time to time was elevated above the notions of \n rn \n and \n y \n Filial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one's parents was often associated with one's devotion to the state \n Buddhism \n Early \n Buddhism \n did not have a strong tradition of filial piety \n citation needed \n Buddhism in India \n involved many men leaving or abandoning their families parents wives and children to become monks Buddha himself was said to have done so The true Buddhist had to reject all family ties just as they had to reject social and class ties if they were to pursue \n Nirvana \n Family was viewed as just another encumbrance of mortal life that had to be dealt with Sorrow and grief were said to be \"born of those who are dear\" \n non-primary source needed \n Theravada Buddhism stressed \n individual \n salvation and had little room for the interdependent society that Confucianism had created in China which stressed the good of the \n community \n more than the good of the \n individual \n In India Buddhism also advocated \n celibacy \n among its monks which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view given that it was viewed as the child's duty to continue the parental line \n Introduction of Buddhism in China \n When Buddhism was introduced to China it was redefined to support filial piety The \n Mouzi Lihuolun \n a work defending Buddhism to the Chinese presented arguments for Buddhist monks' seemingly poor treatment of their parents by closely reading the works of Confucius himself The \n Guiyangtu \n and \n Vimalakirti \n Nirdesa Sutra \n are also Buddhist works portraying lay householder duties and obligations in contrast with pure monastic renunciation \n The Mouzi Lihuolun \n The \n Mouzi Lihuolun \n compares the Buddhist monk to a filial son who saves his father from drowning \n A long time ago the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it happened that their father fell into the water His sons rolled up their sleeves seized his head and turned him upside down forcing the water out of his mouth thus bringing their father back to life Now to seize one's father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial Yet they could have done nothing better to save their father's life If they had folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons their father's life would have been lost in the waters \n The behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on their path towards salvation The \n Mouzi Lihuolun \n also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good \n ethics \n It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of \n ascetic \n sages who had not had children or family but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parents \n soul \n is the most important one The same essential argument was made later by \n Sun Chuo \n who argued that Buddhists monks far from working solely for their own benefit were working to ensure the salvation of all people and aiding their family by doing so \n Huiyuan \n continued in this reasoning arguing that if one member leaves the household to be a monk then all other members of the family would benefit from good fortune and lead superior lives \n Adapting their efforts \n These philosophical arguments were not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese that the behavior advocated by Buddhism was correct and so less subtle methods were employed To more directly give Buddhism filial nature passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism The story of Shanzi Syama in \n Sanskrit \n Sama in Pali from the Sama Jataka is an example of this \n Story of Shanzi \n Shanzi spent his entire life aiding his blind parents until he was accidentally killed But because of his life of filial devotion he was miraculously revived This story was often mentioned in the Chinese canon of Buddhist writings included in a number of different anthologies such as the \n Liudu Jijing \n and referred to by other \n Chinese Buddhist \n writers \n While it is clearly of \n Indian \n origin based on the story of \n Shravan \n this tale was virtually indistinguishable from similar Chinese tales While the tale was transmitted along with Buddhist writings philosophically it had very little to do with traditional Buddhism \n The story of Moggallana \n Mulian Rescues His Mother \n Another story advocating filial piety is that of \n Moggallana \n a Buddhist monk who goes to great lengths to rescue his mother from condemnation for her unjust life This story appeared in the \n Ullambana Sutra \n and it is far more relevant to Buddhism than the tale of Shan-tz though it was still not a particularly important tale in Indian Buddhism In China however these stories became not just elements of Buddhist scripture but also popular tales which were even told amongst non-Buddhists While these tales were a part of the Buddhist tradition Chinese Buddhism raised them from a peripheral role to a central one \n citation needed \n Other texts \n Another tale that achieved great renown in China was that of the \n Buddha \n rising to heaven for three months after his \n Enlightenment \n to preach and teach his mother his new philosophy This tale was used to indicate that the Buddha did indeed show proper concern and respect for his parents in that he cared for their immortal souls \n A number of apocryphal texts were also written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents and the parent-child relationship The most important of these the \n Sutra of Filial Piety \n was written early in the \n Tang dynasty \n This \n Sutra \n has the Buddha making the very Confucian argument that parents made great sacrifices and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child In return each child must repay this kindness with loyalty and respect Despite being a forgery the sutra was accepted as accurate by generations of scholars and commoners and it played an important role in the development of a \n fully Chinese variation of Buddhism \n Other documents discussing the Buddhas views on the parent child-relationship were also probably forgeries The \n Sutra on a Filial Son \n for instance also sounds far more Chinese than Indian and shows Confucianist influence \n Rykyan cultures \n Filial piety is an important element in the cultures of the \n Ryukyu Islands \n It is the topic of half of the verses of the most popular Okinawan folksong \n Tinsagu nu Hana \n Criticism \n Lu Xun in his collection \"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk\" criticized the stories \"He Buried His Son for His Mother\" and \"Wang Xiang He Lay on Ice in Search of Carp\" \n The latter story is about Wang Xiang a very young boy who laid on an iced lake in order to get a fish for his sick mother Although this may seem a bit extreme filial piety emphasizes on the importance of putting one's parents' interests

also called 'Montagnards' that after were held responsible by some commentators for the repressive and violent government over France between June and July a period analogously labeled ' \n Reign of Terror \n ' by commentators \n The given definition in Oxford Dictionary shows the term 'terrorist' in its first use was meant as abusive term for someone's political or historical ideas or

\n on August by the neo-fascist group \n Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari \n With deaths it is the deadliest massacre in the \n history of Italy as a Republic \n There are over different definitions of terrorism \n U S American political philosopher \n Michael Walzer \n in wrote \"Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people at random to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders\" \n This meaning can be traced back to \n Sergey Nechayev \n who described himself as a \"terrorist\" \n Nechayev founded the Russian terrorist group \"People's Retribution\" in \n In November a \n Secretary-General of the United Nations \n report described terrorism as any act \"intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act\" \n Alternatively responding to developments in modern warfare \n Paul James \n and \n Jonathan Friedman \n distinguish between state terrorism against \n non-combatants \n and state terrorism against \n combatants \n including ' \n Shock and Awe \n ' tactics \n \"Shock and Awe\" as a subcategory of \"rapid dominance\" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy It is a form of state-terrorism The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel \n But defining terrorism has proven controversial Various legal systems and government agencies use different \n definitions of terrorism in their national legislation \n Moreover the \n international community \n has been slow to formulate a universally agreed legally binding definition of this crime These difficulties arise from the fact that the term \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged \n In this regard Angus Martyn briefing the Australian parliament stated \n The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism During the 1970s and 1980s the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination \n These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a \n Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism \n that incorporates a single all-encompassing legally binding criminal law definition of terrorism \n The international community has adopted a series of \n sectoral conventions \n that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities \n Since the \n United Nations General Assembly \n has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism \n Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable whatever the considerations of a political philosophical ideological racial ethnic religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them \n U S Code Title Chapter Section 2656f d defines terrorism as \"Premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents usually intended to influence an audience\" \n Bruce Hoffman \n an American scholar has noted \n It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus In the first edition of his magisterial survey 'Political Terrorism A Research Guide ' Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definitions of terrorism in an effort to discover a broadly acceptable reasonably comprehensive explication of the word Four years and a second edition later Schmid was no closer to the goal of his quest conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the \"search for an adequate definition is still on\" Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt \n Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism He proposes that \n The \n Baghdad \n bus station was the scene of a triple \n car bombing in August \n that killed people \n By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime we come to appreciate that terrorism is \n ineluctably political in aims and motives \n violent or equally important threatens violence \n designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target \n conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced motivated or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders \n and \n perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity \n A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the \n George C Marshall European Center for Security Studies \n underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism \n Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear sometimes indiscriminate through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets sometimes iconic symbols Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience s in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states \n Oslo \n Norway \n immediately after the \n terrorist attack in Norway \n perpetrated by \n Anders Behring Breivik \n Each act of terrorism is a \"performance\" devised to affect many large audiences Terrorists also attack national symbols \n to show power and to attempt to shake the foundation of the country or society they are opposed to This may negatively affect a government while increasing the prestige of the given \n terrorist group \n and/or ideology behind a terrorist act \n Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose \n This is often where the inter-relationship between \n terrorism and religion \n occurs When a political struggle is integrated into the framework of a religious or \"cosmic\" \n struggle such as over the control of an ancestral homeland or holy site such as \n Israel \n and \n Jerusalem \n failing in the political goal nationalism becomes equated with spiritual failure which for the highly committed is worse than their own death or the deaths of innocent civilians \n Their suffering accomplishes the terrorists' goals of instilling fear getting their message out to an audience or otherwise satisfying the demands of their often radical religious and political agendas \n Some official governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act \n bettersourceneeded \n to distinguish between actions authorized by a government and thus \"lawful\" and those of other actors including individuals and small groups For example carrying out a \n strategic bombing \n on an enemy city which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted \n attribution needed \n because it denies the existence of \n state terrorism \n the same act may or may not be classed as terrorism depending on whether its sponsorship is traced to a \"legitimate\" government \"legitimacy\" and \"lawfulness\" are subjective depending on the perspective of one government or another and it diverges from the historically accepted meaning and origin of the term \n According to Ali Khan the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment \n An associated and arguably more easily definable but \n not equivalent \n term is \n violent non-state actor \n The semantic scope of this term includes not only \"terrorists\" but while excluding some individuals or groups who have previously been described as \"terrorists\" and also explicitly excludes \n state terrorism \n U S president \n Barack Obama \n commenting on the \n Boston Marathon bombings \n of April declared that \" a nytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror\" \n Various commentators have pointed out the distinction between \"act of terror\" and \"terrorism\" particularly when used by the White House \n U S C defines \"international terrorism\" and \"domestic terrorism\" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code entitled \"Terrorism\" \n \"International terrorism\" means activities with the following three characteristics \n Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law Appear to be intended i to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ii to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or iii to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping and Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U S or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum \n Pejorative use \n Controversies about Labeling Terrorism \n Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong' the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties either governments or non-state-groups \n Those labeled \"terrorists\" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation such as \n separatist \n freedom fighter \n liberator \n revolutionary \n vigilante \n militant \n paramilitary \n guerrilla \n rebel \n patriot or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures \n Jihadi \n mujaheddin \n and \n fedayeen \n are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists \n On whether particular terrorist acts such as killing non-combatants can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance philosophers have expressed different views while according to David Rodin \n utilitarian \n philosophers can in theory conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way in practice the \"harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism\" \n Among the non-utilitarian philosophers \n Michael Walzer \n argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case when \"a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants then it is morally entitled to do so\" \n In his book \n Inside Terrorism \n Bruce Hoffman \n offered an explanation of why the term \n terrorism \n becomes distorted \n On one point at least everyone agrees \n terrorism \n is a pejorative term It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore 'What is called terrorism ' Brian Jenkins has written 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view Use of the term implies a moral judgment and if one party can successfully attach the label \n terrorist \n to its opponent then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint ' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization \n terrorist \n becomes almost unavoidably subjective depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned If one identifies with the victim of the violence for example then the act is terrorism If however one identifies with the perpetrator the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic if not positive or at the worst an ambivalent light and it is not terrorism \n President Reagan meeting with \n Afghan Mujahideen \n leaders in the Oval Office in \n The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the \n aphorism \n \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\" \n This is exemplified when a group using \n irregular military \n methods is an ally of a \n state \n against a mutual enemy but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally During \n World War II \n the \n Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army \n was allied with the British but during the \n Malayan Emergency \n members of its successor the \n Malayan Races Liberation Army \n were branded \"terrorists\" by the British \n More recently \n Ronald Reagan \n and others in the American administration frequently called the \n mujaheddin \n \"freedom fighters\" during the \n SovietAfghan War \n yet twenty years later when a new generation of Afghan men were fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers their attacks were labelled \"terrorism\" by \n George W Bush \n Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action \n Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's \n Carleton University \n defines \"terrorist acts\" as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals and said \n There is the famous statement 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter ' But that is grossly misleading It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts it is terrorism regardless \n Some groups when involved in a \"liberation\" struggle have been called \"terrorists\" by the Western governments or media Later these same persons as leaders of the liberated nations are called \"statesmen\" by similar organizations Two examples of this phenomenon are the \n Nobel Peace Prize \n laureates \n Menachem Begin \n and \n Nelson Mandela \n WikiLeaks \n editor \n Julian Assange \n has been called a \"terrorist\" by \n Sarah Palin \n and \n Joe Biden \n Sometimes states that are close allies for reasons of history culture and politics can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists For instance for many years some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the \n Provisional Irish Republican Army \n IRA as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies the United Kingdom that the UK branded as terrorism This was highlighted by the \n Quinn v Robinson \n case \n Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" because they are loosely defined potentially controversial in nature and subjective terms \n Violent non-state actor \n History of terrorism \n The \n Irish Republican Brotherhood \n was one of the earliest organizations to use modern \n terrorist tactics \n Pictured \"The Fenian \n Guy Fawkes \n \" by \n John Tenniel \n Depending on how broadly the term is defined the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD \n Sicarii Zealots \n though some dispute whether the group a radical offshoot of the \n Zealots \n which was active in \n Judaea Province \n at the beginning of the 1st century AD was in fact terrorist According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian \n Josephus \n after the \n Zealotry \n rebellion against Roman rule in Judea when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed \n Judas of Galilee \n formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots the \n Sicarii \n in AD \n Their terror was also directed against Jewish \"collaborators\" including temple priests \n Sadducees \n Herodians \n and other wealthy elites \n The term \"terrorism\" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the \n Jacobin Club \n during the \" \n Reign of Terror \n \" in the \n French Revolution \n \"Terror is nothing other than justice prompt severe inflexible\" said Jacobin leader \n Maximilien Robespierre \n In \n Edmund Burke \n denounced the Jacobins for letting \"thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists loose on the people\" of France \n In January Italian patriot \n Felice Orsini \n threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor \n Napoleon III \n Eight bystanders were killed and injured \n The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups \n Arguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the \n Irish Republican Brotherhood \n founded in as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group \n that carried out attacks in England \n The group initiated the \n Fenian dynamite campaign \n in one of the first modern terror campaigns \n Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination this campaign used modern timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain in order to achieve political gains \n Another early terrorist group was \n Narodnaya Volya \n founded in Russia in as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by \n Sergei Nechayev \n and \" \n propaganda by the deed \n \" theorist \n Carlo Pisacane \n The group developed ideassuch as \n targeted killing \n of the 'leaders of oppression'that were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the agesuch as the invention of dynamite which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of \n enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination \n Scholars of terrorism refer to four major waves of global terrorism \"the Anarchist the Anti-Colonial the New Left and the Religious The first three have been completed and lasted around years the fourth is now

defines terrorism as \"a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes\" It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories \n Civil disorder \n A form of collective violence interfering with the \n peace \n security and normal functioning of the community \n Political terrorism \n Violent \n criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate \n fear \n in the community or substantial segment of it for political purposes \n Non-Political terrorism \n Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits \"conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for \n coercive \n purposes but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective\" \n Quasi-terrorism \n The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction \n For example the fleeing \n felon \n who takes \n hostages \n is a quasi-terrorist whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different \n Limited political terrorism \n Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a \n revolutionary \n approach limited political terrorism refers to \"acts of terrorism which are committed for \n ideological \n or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the \n state \n \" \n Official or state terrorism \n \"referring to nations whose rule is based upon \n fear \n and \n oppression \n that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions\" It may also be referred to as \n Structural Terrorism \n defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives often as part of their foreign policy \n Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways for example broadly classifying it into \n domestic terrorism \n and \n international terrorism \n or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism \n One way the typology of terrorism may be defined \n Political terrorism \n Sub-state terrorism \n Social revolutionary terrorism \n Nationalist-separatist terrorism \n

and \n the Pentagon \n in the United States on September These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported such as the \n Palestinian airplane hijackings in \n and the South Moluccan hostage crisis in the \n Netherlands \n in \n Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness \n Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives which are often murky and undefined \n Additionally Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism \n Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence \n Some terrorists like \n Timothy McVeigh \n were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens \n According to Paul Gill John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs The same report indicates that Just less than a third 9% have pre-existing mental health disorders while many are found to have these problems upon arrest At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution a further 1% lived with others and no data were available for the remaining cases 2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time 3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others while 3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault \n It is true that one of the main reasons behind terrorism is a strong religious belief however there are other factors such as cultural social and political Even though these reasons are like most around the world The drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya A distinction must be made from the beginning between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads although on the other hand most of the non-Chechen fighters did Janeczko \n One of the major reasons why terrorists are motivated and perhaps eager to carry out horrific acts is assurance of financial stability for their

\n Israel \n Indonesia \n India \n Spain \n Germany \n Italy \n and the \n Philippines \n have also experienced domestic terrorism \n While a democratic nation espousing \n civil liberties \n may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties \n For this reason \n homegrown terrorism \n has started to be seen as a greater threat as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden \n This dilemma some social theorists would conclude may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist s namely to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system \n Religious terrorism \n Religious

College Park \n religious extremism \n has overtaken \n national separatism \n and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda Before it was nationalist separatist terrorist organisations such as the \n IRA \n and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown The prevalence of Islamist groups in \n Iraq \n Afghanistan \n Pakistan \n Nigeria \n and \n Syria \n is the main driver behind these trends \n Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since are \n Boko Haram \n Al Qaeda \n the \n Taliban \n and \n ISIL \n These groups have been most active in Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan Nigeria and Syria 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries \n In the \n Southern Poverty Law Center \n released a report on terrorism in the United States The report titled \n The Age of the Wolf \n found that during

Christian Identity \n movement is usually accompanied by anti-government sentiments \n Adherents of \n Christian Identity \n believe that \n whites \n of European descent can be traced back to the \" \n Lost Tribes of Israel \n \" and many consider \n Jews \n to be the Satanic offspring of \n Eve \n and the \n Serpent \n This group has committed \n hate crimes \n bombings and other acts of

anti-Semitism \n and eventually \n Christian Identity \n theology diverged from traditional \n Anglo-Israelism \n and developed what is known as the \n \"two seed\" \n theory \n According to the two-seed theory the Jewish people are descended from \n Cain \n and the serpent not from \n Shem \n The white European seedline is descended from the \"lost tribes\" of Israel They hold themselves to \"God's laws\" not to \"man's laws\" and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the \n New World Order \n Dawabsheh \n family home after \n Duma arson attack \n

groups or states According to some definitions clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war However the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive \n cells \n highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times such as the \n September attacks \n the \n London underground bombing \n Mumbai attacks \n and the \n Bali bombing \n were planned and carried out by a close clique composed of close friends family members and other strong social networks These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient \n telecommunications \n to succeed where others had failed \n Over the years much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances \n Others like Roderick Hindery have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists Some security organizations designate these groups as \n violent non-state actors \n citation needed \n A study by economist \n Alan B Krueger \n found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background 28% vs 33% and more likely to have at least a high-school education 47% vs 38% Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families vs 30% of male Palestinians and over 60% had gone beyond high school vs 15% of the populace A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not terrorists are more likely to come from here show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated does not make them a potential terrorist \n To avoid detection a terrorist will look dress and behave normally until executing the assigned mission Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality physical or sociological traits are not useful \n The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person \n However

lower is nearly always invisible that is unnoticed When it is noticed it is fully rationalized Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable and when it does occur it is regarded with shock horror and the fetishization of the victims \n Derrick Jensen \n Infant crying in Shanghai's South Station after the Japanese bombing August \n As with \"terrorism\" the concept of \"state terrorism\" is controversial \n The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of international Conventions on the subject and none of them referred to State terrorism which was not an international legal concept If States abused their power they should be judged against international conventions dealing with \n war crimes \n international human rights law \n and \n international humanitarian law \n Former United Nations \n Secretary-General \n Kofi Annan \n has said that it is \"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism' The \n use of force by states \n is already thoroughly regulated under international law\" \n However he also made clear that \"regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians or non-combatants regardless of one's cause is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism \" \n USS Arizona BB-39 \n burning during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor December \n State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism Professor of \n Political Science \n Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German \n bombing of London \n the Japanese \n bombing of Pearl Harbor \n the British and American \n firebombing of Dresden \n and the U S \n atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \n during \n World War II \n He argues that \"the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents \" He also cites the \n first strike \n option as an example of the \"terror of coercive diplomacy\" as a form of this which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using \n nuclear weapons \n in \"crisis management\" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II In this analysis state terrorism exhibited as a form of \n foreign policy \n was shaped by the presence and use of \n weapons of mass destruction \n and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state \n St Paul's Cathedral \n after the German bombing of London c \n Charles Stewart Parnell \n described \n William Ewart Gladstone \n 's \n Irish Coercion Act \n as terrorism in his \"no-Rent manifesto\" in during the \n Irish Land War \n The concept is also used to describe \n political repressions \n by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear For example taking and executing civilian \n hostages \n or \n extrajudicial elimination \n campaigns are commonly considered \"terror\" or terrorism for example during the \n Red Terror \n or the \n Great Terror \n Such actions are also often described as \n democide \n or \n genocide \n which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism \n Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide \n Western democracies \n including the United States \n have supported state terrorism \n and mass killings \n with some examples being the \n Indonesian mass killings of \n and \n Operation \n Condor \n Connection with tourism \n The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the \n Luxor massacre \n in Egypt \n In the 1970s the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September were the symbolic epicenter which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet \n From this event onwards the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West were conceived as dangerous and frightful \n Funding \n Terrorist financing \n State sponsors \n have constituted a major form of funding for example \n Palestine Liberation Organization \n Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine \n and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations were funded by the \n Soviet Union \n The \n Stern Gang \n received funding from \n Italian Fascist \n officers in Beirut to undermine the \n British Mandate for Palestine \n Pakistan \n has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours especially \n India \n \" \n Revolutionary tax \n \" is another major form of funding and essentially a euphemism for \" \n protection money \n \" \n Revolutionary taxes \"play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population\" \n Other major sources of funding include \n kidnapping \n for ransoms \n smuggling \n including \n wildlife smuggling \n fraud and robbery \n The \n Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \n has reportedly received funding \"via private donations from the \n Gulf states \n \" \n The \n Financial Action Task Force \n is an inter-governmental body whose mandate since October has included combating \n terrorist financing \n Tactics \n Tactics of terrorism \n The \n Wall Street bombing \n at noon on September killed thirty-eight people and injured several hundred The perpetrators were never caught \n Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity usually using \n explosives \n or \n poison \n Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance and may train participants plant undercover agents and raise money from supporters or through \n organized crime \n Communications occur through modern \n telecommunications \n or through old-fashioned methods such as \n couriers \n There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing \n weapons of mass destruction \n Terrorism is a form of \n asymmetric warfare \n and is more common when direct \n conventional warfare \n will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power \n The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale unresolved political conflict The type of conflict varies widely historical examples include \n Secession \n of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state \n Dominance of territory or resources by various \n ethnic groups \n Imposition of a particular form of government \n Economic deprivation of a population \n Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army \n Religious fanaticism \n Responses \n Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism \n Responses to terrorism are broad in scope They can include re-alignments of the \n political spectrum \n and reassessments of \n fundamental values \n Specific types of responses include \n Targeted laws criminal procedures deportations and enhanced police powers \n Target hardening \n such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers \n Preemptive or reactive military action \n Increased intelligence and surveillance activities \n Preemptive humanitarian activities \n More permissive interrogation and detention policies \n The term \" \n counter-terrorism \n \" has a narrower connotation implying that it is directed at terrorist actors \n Response in the United States \n War on Terror \n X-ray backscatter technology \n AIT \n machine used by the \n TSA \n to screen passengers According to the TSA this is what the remote TSA agent would see on their screen \n According to a report by Dana Priest and William M Arkin in \n The Washington Post \n \"Some government organizations and private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism homeland security and intelligence in about locations across the United States \" \n America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought Republicans typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East Democrats by contrast generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home \n In the introduction of the \n U S Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual \n Sarah Sewall states the need for \"U S forces to make securing the civilian rather than destroying the enemy their top priority The civilian population is the center of gravitythe deciding factor in the struggle Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemiesnew insurgent recruits or informantsand erode support of the host nation \" Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle \"Sometimes the more you protect your force the less secure you may be Sometimes the more force is used the less effective it is The more successful the counterinsurgency is the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted Sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction \" \n This strategy often termed \"courageous restraint\" has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield yet it fails to address the central truth the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown \n Terrorism research \n Terrorism research also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts for example by research centres such as the British \n Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence \n the \n Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies \n and the \n International Centre for Counter-Terrorism \n ICCT There are several academic journals devoted to the field \n Mass media \n La Terroriste \n a poster depicting a female member of the \n Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party \n throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car \n Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media \n The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages \n This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource \n The mass media will on occasion censor organizations involved in terrorism through self-restraint or regulation to discourage further terrorism However this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media Conversely \n James F Pastor \n explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media and the underlying benefit each receives from the other \n There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt A point at which the violence may well escalate but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the

the close connection between terrorism and the media calling publicity 'the oxygen of terrorism' \n Outcome of terrorist groups \n How terrorist groups end n = The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations percent with most of the rest terminated by routine policing percent Groups that were ended by military force constituted only percent \n Jones and Libicki created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between and They found of those splintered and were still active in \n Of the ones that ended percent converted to nonviolent political actions like the \n Irish Republican Army \n in Northern Ireland Law enforcement took out percent Ten percent won Only groups percent were taken out by military force \n Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency of those had ended by Of those percent converted to nonviolent political actors Only percent were taken out by law enforcement percent won

manufacturing \n including of pharmaceutical products or scientific research as well as aerospace semiconductor engineering applications with a low level of environmental \n pollutants \n such as dust airborne \n microbes \n aerosol \n particles and chemical vapors More accurately a cleanroom has a \n controlled \n level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a specified particle size To give perspective the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains particles per cubic meter in the size range \n m \n and larger in diameter corresponding to an \n ISO \n cleanroom while an ISO cleanroom allows no particles in that size range and only particles per cubic meter of 3m and smaller \n Overview \n Air flow principles \n Personnel contamination of cleanrooms \n Cleanroom classification and standardization \n ISO 14644-1 and ISO \n US FED STD 209E \n EU GMP classification \n BS \n The modern cleanroom was invented by American \n physicist \n Willis Whitfield \n As employee of the Sandia National Laboratories Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in \n Prior to Whitfield's invention earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable \n airflows \n Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities \n Within a few years of its invention in the 1960s Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than billion USD in sales worldwide \n Overview \n Cleanrooms can be very large Entire manufacturing facilities can be contained within a cleanroom with factory floors covering thousands of square meters They are used extensively in \n semiconductor manufacturing \n biotechnology \n the \n life sciences \n and other fields that are very sensitive to environmental contamination There are also modular cleanrooms \n The air entering a cleanroom from outside is \n filtered \n to exclude dust and the air inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air \n HEPA \n and/or ultra-low particulate air \n ULPA \n filters to remove internally generated contaminants \n Staff enter and leave through \n airlocks \n sometimes including an \n air shower \n stage and wear protective clothing such as hoods face masks gloves boots and coveralls \n Equipment inside the cleanroom is designed to generate minimal air contamination Only special \n mops \n and \n buckets \n are used Cleanroom furniture is designed to produce a minimum of particles and is easy to clean \n Common materials such as \n paper \n pencils \n and \n fabrics \n made from natural fibers are often excluded and alternatives used Cleanrooms are not \n sterile \n i e free of uncontrolled microbes \n only airborne particles are controlled Particle levels are usually tested using a \n particle counter \n and microorganisms detected and counted through environmental monitoring methods \n Some cleanrooms are kept at a \n positive pressure \n so if any leaks occur air leaks out of the chamber instead of unfiltered air coming in \n Some cleanroom \n HVAC \n systems control the \n humidity \n to low levels such that extra equipment \"ionizers\" is necessary to prevent \n electrostatic discharge \n problems \n Low-level cleanrooms may only require special shoes with completely smooth soles that do not track in dust or dirt However for safety reasons shoe soles must not create slipping hazards Access to a cleanroom is usually restricted to those wearing a \n cleanroom suit \n In cleanrooms in which the standards of air contamination are less rigorous the entrance to the cleanroom may not have an air shower An anteroom known as a \"gray room\" is used to put on clean-room clothing \n Some manufacturing facilities do not use fully classified cleanrooms but use some cleanroom practices to maintain their contamination requirements \n Air flow principles \n Air flow pattern for \"Turbulent Cleanroom\" \n Air flow pattern for \" \n Laminar Flow \n Cleanroom\" \n Cleanrooms maintain particulate-free air through the use of either \n HEPA \n or \n ULPA \n filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles Laminar or unidirectional air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air Turbulent or non unidirectional air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion although not all in the same direction The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products \n Personnel contamination of cleanrooms \n In the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors control of microorganisms is important especially microorganisms likely to be deposited into the air stream from skin shedding Studying cleanroom microflora is of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel to assess changes in trends Shifts in the types of microflora may indicate deviations from the norm such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices \n In assessing cleanroom microorganisms the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin Gram-positive cocci although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment Gram-positive rods and water Gram-negative rods are also detected although in lower number Common bacterial genera include \n Micrococcus \n Staphylococcus \n Corynebacterium \n and \n Bacillus \n and fungal genera include \n Aspergillus \n and \n Pencillin \n Cleanroom classification and standardization \n Cleanrooms are classified according to the number and size of particles permitted per volume of air Large numbers like \"class 100\" or \"class 1000\" refer to \n FED-STD-209E \n and denote the number of particles of size 5m or larger permitted per cubic foot of air The standard also allows interpolation for example \n SNOLAB \n is maintained as a class cleanroom \n A discrete light-scattering airborne particle counter is used to determine the concentration of airborne particles equal to and larger than the specified sizes at designated sampling locations \n Small numbers refer to \n ISO 14644-1 \n standards which specify the decimal \n logarithm \n of the number of particles 1m or larger permitted per m \n of air So for example an ISO class cleanroom has at most \n particles/m \n Both FS 209E and ISO 14644-1 assume log-log relationships between particle size and particle concentration For that reason zero particle concentration does not exist Some classes do not require testing some particle sizes because the concentration is too low or too high to be practical to test for but such blanks should not be read as zero \n Because 1m \n is about 35ft \n the two standards are mostly equivalent when measuring 5m particles although the testing standards differ Ordinary room air is around class or ISO \n ISO 14644-1 and ISO \n ISO 14644-1 \n and \n ISO \n are \n non-governmental \n standards developed by the \n International Organization for Standardization \n ISO \n The former applies to clean rooms in general

Technologies \n Scientific journals \n Central principles of waste management \n Diagram of the waste hierarchy \n There are a number of \n concepts about waste management \n which vary in their usage between countries or regions Some of the most general widely used concepts include \n Waste hierarchy \n The \n waste hierarchy \n refers to the \"3 Rs\" \n reduce \n reuse \n and \n recycle \n which classify waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of \n waste minimisation \n The waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste see \n resource recovery \n The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is for policy to take action first and prevent the generation of waste The next step or preferred action is to reduce the generation of waste i e by re-use The next is recycling which would include composting Following this step is material recovery and \n waste-to-energy \n Energy can be recovered from processes i e landfill and combustion at this level of the hierarchy The final action is disposal in landfills or through incineration without \n energy recovery \n This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented diverted or recovered \n pageneeded \n The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product \n pageneeded \n Life-cycle of a product \n The life-cycle begins with design then proceeds through manufacture distribution use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce reuse and recycle Each of the above stages of the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention to rethink the need for the product to redesign to minimize waste potential to extend its use \n pageneeded \n The key behind the life-cycle of a product is to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste \n Resource efficiency \n Resource efficiency \n reflects the understanding that current global economic growth and development can not be sustained with the current production and consumption patterns Globally we are extracting more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish \n pageneeded \n Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal This process of resource efficiency can address \n sustainability \n An example of such a source in which we are extracting to produce more goods and causes damage to the environment is the waste of fossil fuels An example of such a fossil fuel is the waste of energy 32% of energy wasted for grains 3% energy wasted in vegetables 4% wasted in fruit 32% wasted in dairy 16% wasted in meat poultry and fish 4% wasted in eggs This shows how much energy we are wasting by wasting grains vegetables fruit dairy meat poultry fish and \n eggs \n Additionally that is just the energy associated with growing those food commodities There is also more energy associated in packaging and transporting those goods At the end of the day we are not using our resources efficiently by wasting food The amount of energy that is wasted in food loss is also the amount of energy taken from other sources that perhaps need it and can make a better use from it \n Polluter-pays principle \n The \n polluter-pays principle \n is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment With respect to waste management this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material \n History of waste management \n Throughout most of history the amount of \n waste \n generated by humans was insignificant due to low \n population density \n and low societal levels of the exploitation of \n natural resources \n Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human \n biodegradable waste \n and these were released back into the ground locally with minimum \n environmental impact \n Tools made out of \n wood \n or \n metal \n were generally reused or passed down through the generations \n However some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others In particular the \n Maya \n of \n Central America \n had a fixed monthly ritual in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps \n Modern era \n Sir \n Edwin Chadwick \n 's report \n The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population \n was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal \n Following the onset of \n industrialisation \n and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in \n England \n the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of \n sanitation \n and the general quality of urban life The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations \n Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as when \n Corbyn Morris \n in London proposed that \" as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance it is proposed that the cleaning of this city should be put under one uniform public management and all the filth be conveyed by the \n Thames \n to proper distance in the country\" \n However it was not until the mid-19th century spurred by increasingly devastating \n cholera \n outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged Highly influential in this new focus was the report \n The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population \n in \n of the \n social reformer \n Edwin Chadwick \n in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population \n In the UK the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London The \n Metropolitan Board of Works \n was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the \n Public Health Act \n made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in \"moveable receptacles for disposalthe first concept for a dust-bin \n Manlove Alliott & Co Ltd \n destructor furnace The use of \n incinerators \n for waste disposal became popular in the late 19th century \n The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first \n incineration \n plants or as they were then called \"destructors\" In the first incinerator was built in \n Nottingham \n by \n Manlove Alliott & Co Ltd \n to the design of Albert Fryer \n However these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas \n Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of \n Europe \n and \n North America \n In \n New York City \n became the first U S city with public-sector garbage management \n Early \n garbage removal trucks \n were simply open bodied \n dump trucks \n pulled by a team of horses They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain \n These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck The \n Garwood Load Packer \n was the first truck in to incorporate a hydraulic compactor \n Waste handling and transport \n Main articles \n Waste collection vehicle \n Dustbin \n and \n Waste sorting \n Molded plastic wheeled waste bin in \n Berkshire \n England \n Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste Some areas especially those in less developed countries do not have formal waste-collection systems \n Waste handling practices \n Curbside collection \n is the most common method of disposal in most European countries \n Canada \n New Zealand \n and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility In some areas vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes Systems are in use in Europe and North America \n Automated vacuum collection \n In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste salvaging recyclables and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner In \n San Francisco \n the local government established its \n Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance \n in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\" requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system blue for recyclables green for compostables and black for landfill-bound materials provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler Recology The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion the highest diversion rate in North America \n Other businesses such as \n Waste Industries \n use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans \n Financial models \n In most developed countries domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income or national house value Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling In some areas such as \n Taipei \n the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce Waste will only be collected by the city council if waste is disposed in government issued rubbish bags This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate \n citation needed \n Disposal methods \n Landfill \n Landfill \n A \n landfill compaction vehicle \n in action \n Spittelau incineration plant in \n Vienna \n Incineration \n Incineration \n Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products This method is useful for disposal of residue of both solid waste management and solid residue from waste water management This process reduces the volumes of solid waste to to percent of the original volume Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \" \n thermal treatment \n \" Incinerators convert waste materials into \n heat \n gas \n steam \n and \n ash \n Incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry It is used to dispose of solid liquid and gaseous waste It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain \n hazardous waste \n materials such as biological \n medical waste \n Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal due to issues such as emission of gaseous \n pollutants \n Incineration is common in countries such as \n Japan \n where land is more scarce as these facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills \n Waste-to-energy \n WtE or energy-from-waste EfW are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat steam or electricity Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks Particular concern has focused on some very persistent \n organic compounds \n such as \n dioxins \n furans \n and \n PAHs \n which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences \n Recycling \n Recycling \n Waste not the Waste Sign in \n Tamil Nadu \n India \n Steel crushed and baled for \n recycling \n Recycling is a \n resource recovery \n practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles a procedure called \n kerbside collection \n In some communities the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins e g for paper plastics metals prior to its collection In other communities all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection and the sorting is handled later at a central facility The latter method is known as \" \n single-stream recycling \n \" \n The most common consumer products recycled include \n aluminium \n such as beverage cans \n copper \n such as wire \n steel \n from food and aerosol cans old steel furnishings or equipment rubber \n tyres \n polyethylene \n and \n PET \n bottles \n glass \n bottles and jars \n paperboard \n cartons \n newspapers \n magazines and light paper and \n corrugated fiberboard \n boxes \n PVC \n LDPE \n PP \n and \n PS \n see \n resin identification code \n are also recyclable These items are usually composed of a single type of material making them relatively easy to recycle into new products The recycling of complex products such as computers and electronic equipment is more difficult due to the additional dismantling and separation required \n The type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials However certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed In July the Chinese government announced an import ban of categories of recyclables and solid waste including plastic textiles and mixed paper placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally which exported directly or indirectly to China \n Re-use \n Biological reprocessing \n Main articles \n Composting \n Home composting \n Anaerobic digestion \n and \n Microbial fuel cell \n An active \n compost \n heap \n Recoverable materials that are organic in nature such as plant material food scraps and paper products can be recovered through \n composting \n and digestion processes to \n decompose \n the organic matter The resulting organic material is then recycled as \n mulch \n or \n compost \n for agricultural or landscaping purposes In addition waste gas from the process such as methane can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat CHP/cogeneration maximising efficiencies The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter See \n resource recovery \n Energy recovery \n Waste-to-energy \n Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat electricity or fuel through a variety of processes including combustion gasification pyrolyzation anaerobic digestion and \n landfill gas \n recovery \n This process is often called waste-to-energy Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills \n Globally waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management \n The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel see above to fuel for \n boilers \n to generate steam and electricity in a \n turbine \n Pyrolysis \n and \n gasification \n are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited \n oxygen \n availability The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high \n pressure \n Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid liquid and gas products The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products chemical refinery The solid residue char can be further refined into products such as \n activated carbon \n Gasification and advanced \n Plasma arc gasification \n are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas \n syngas \n composed of \n carbon monoxide \n and \n hydrogen \n The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and \n steam \n An alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition hydrothermal monophasic oxidation \n Pyrolysis \n Pyrolysis \n Pyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel Different types of waste input such as plant waste food waste tyres placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield a recovered energy source that can be an alternative to fossil fuels \n Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of \n oxygen \n which produces various hydrocarbon gases \n During pyrolysis the molecules of object are subjected to very high temperatures leading to very high vibrations Therefore every molecule in the object is stretched and shaken to an extent that molecules starts breaking down The rate of pyrolysis increases with \n temperature \n In industrial applications temperatures are above 430C 800F \n Fast pyrolysis produces liquid fuel for feedstocks like wood Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal \n Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of \n waste biomass \n into useful liquid fuel Pyrolysis of waste plastics can produce millions of litres of fuel Solid products of this process contain metals glass sand and pyrolysis coke which cannot be converted to gas in the process Compared to the process of incineration certain types of pyrolysis processes prevent the release of harmful product residues that contain some alkali metals sulphur and chlorine Pyrolysis results in smaller contaminant gas emissions which makes for smaller clean-up methods that would reduce cost Some concerns to point out is that pyrolysis yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO \n Resource recovery \n Resource recovery \n Resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste which was intended for disposal for a specific next use \n It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources or convert to energy \n These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility \n Resource recovery is not only environmentally important but it is also cost-effective \n It decreases the amount of waste for disposal saves space in landfills and conserves natural resources \n Resource recovery as opposed to waste management uses LCA life cycle analysis attempts to offer alternatives to waste management For mixed MSW Municipal Solid Waste a number of broad studies have indicated that administration source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path \n As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial many of the items thrown away contain precious metals which can be recycled to create a profit such as the components in circuit boards Other industries can also benefit from resource recycling with the wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials being passed onto sectors such as the horticultural profession In this instance workers can use the recycled chips to create paths walkways or arena surfaces \n Sustainability \n The management of waste is a key component in a business' ability of maintaining \n ISO14001 \n accreditation Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through \n resource recovery \n practices which are sustainability-related activities One way to do this is by shifting away from waste management to resource recovery practices like \n recycling \n materials such as glass food scraps paper and cardboard \n plastic bottles \n and metal An important market for recycled materials is the construction sector Many

steam-enhanced extraction and \n in situ thermal desorption \n and have been used extensively in the USA \n Thermal desorption \n Thermal desorption \n is a technology for soil remediation During the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants e g oil mercury or hydrocarbon to separate them from especially soil or sludge After that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system \n citation needed \n Excavation or dredging \n Excavation \n processes can be as simple as hauling the \n contaminated soil \n to a regulated \n landfill \n but can also

containing contaminants including \n sewage sludge \n with \n harmful microorganisms \n may be conducted Recently ExSitu Chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil This process involves the excavation of the contaminated area into large bermed areas where they are treated using chemical oxidation methods \n Surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation SEAR \n

meet or exceed discharge requirements for most pollutants \n citation needed \n Depending on \n geology \n and soil type pump and treat may be a good method to quickly reduce high concentrations of pollutants It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards due to the equilibrium of \n absorption \n / \n desorption \n processes in the soil However pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation It is expensive to treat the groundwater and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction AS/SVE or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction DPE/MPE Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound especially petroleum by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide \n citation needed \n Solidification and stabilization \n Solidification and stabilization \n work has a reasonably good track record but also a set of serious deficiencies related to durability of solutions and potential long-term effects In addition CO \n emissions due to the use of cement are also becoming a major obstacle to its widespread use in solidification/stabilization projects \n citation needed \n Stabilization/solidification S/S is a remediation and treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop/prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants \n citation needed \n Stabilization \n involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material e g soil or sludge to produce more chemically stable constituents and \n Solidification \n involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical/dimensional stability to contain contaminants in a solid product and reduce access by external agents e g air rainfall \n Conventional S/S is an established remediation technology for contaminated soils and treatment technology for hazardous wastes in many countries in the world However the uptake of S/S technologies has been relatively modest and a number of barriers have been identified including \n citation needed \n the relatively low cost and widespread use of disposal to landfill \n the lack of authoritative technical guidance on S/S \n uncertainty over the durability and rate of contaminant release from S/S-treated material \n experiences of past poor practice in the application of cement stabilization processes used in waste disposal in the 1980s and 1990s ENDS and \n residual liability associated with immobilized contaminants remaining on-site rather than their removal or destruction \n In situ oxidation \n New \n in situ oxidation \n technologies have become popular for remediation of a wide range of soil and groundwater contaminants Remediation by \n chemical oxidation \n involves the injection of strong \n oxidants \n such as \n hydrogen peroxide \n ozone \n gas \n potassium permanganate \n or persulfates \n Oxygen \n gas or ambient air can also be injected to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants One disadvantage of this approach is the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction \n natural attenuation \n where existing conditions enhance anaerobic \n bacteria \n which normally live in the soil prefer a \n reducing environment \n In general though aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted \n citation needed \n The injection of \n gases \n into the groundwater may also cause contamination to spread faster than normal depending on the site's \n hydrogeology \n In these cases injections downgradient of groundwater flow may provide adequate microbial destruction of contaminants prior to exposure to surface waters or drinking water supply wells \n citation needed \n Migration of metal contaminants must also be considered whenever modifying subsurface oxidation-reduction potential Certain metals

technologies to treat the off-gas volatile organic compounds VOCs generated after vacuum removal of air and vapors and VOCs from the subsurface and include granular activated carbon most commonly used historically thermal and/or catalytic oxidation and vapor condensation Generally carbon is used for low below ppmV VOC concentration vapor streams oxidation is used for moderate up to ppmV VOC

\n GAC is used as a filter for air or water Commonly used to filter tap water in household sinks GAC is a highly porous adsorbent material produced by heating organic matter such as coal wood and coconut shell in the absence of air which is then crushed into granules Activated carbon is positively charged and therefore able to remove negative ions from the water such as organic ions ozone chlorine fluorides and dissolved organic solutes by adsorption onto the activated carbon The activated carbon must be replaced periodically as it may become saturated and unable to adsorb i e reduced absorption efficiency with loading Activated carbon is not effective in removing heavy metals \n citation needed \n Thermal \n oxidation \n or \n incineration \n can also be an effective remediation technology This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of \n dioxins \n released in the \n atmosphere \n through the \n exhaust gases \n or effluent off-gas Controlled high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration ~4 ppmV influent vapor streams which require less \n natural gas \n usage than \n catalytic \n oxidation at ~2 ppmV \n citation needed \n Thermal oxidation which uses a system that acts as a furnace and maintains temperatures ranging from to 500F to 820C \n Catalytic oxidation which uses a \n catalyst \n on a support to facilitate a lower temperature oxidation This system usually maintains temperatures ranging from to 800F to 427C \n Vapor condensation \n is the most effective off-gas treatment technology for high over ppmV VOC concentration vapor streams The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as \n dense non-aqueous phase liquids \n DNAPL when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or \n light non-aqueous phase liquids \n LNAPL when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products This recovered chemical can then be \n reused \n or \n recycled \n in a more \n environmentally sustainable \n or \n green \n manner than the alternatives described above This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression \n C3-Technology \n citation needed \n Nanoremediation \n Using nano-sized reactive agents to degrade or immobilize contaminants is termed \n nanoremediation \n In soil or groundwater nanoremediation \n nanoparticles \n are brought into contact with the contaminant through either \n in situ \n injection or a pump-and-treat process The nanomaterials then degrade organic contaminants through \n redox \n reactions or adsorb to and immobilize metals such as \n lead \n or \n arsenic \n In commercial settings this technology has been dominantly applied to \n groundwater remediation \n with research into \n wastewater treatment \n Research is also investigating how nanoparticles may be applied to cleanup of soil and gases \n Nanomaterials are highly reactive because of their high \n surface area \n per unit mass and due to this reactivity nanomaterials may react with target contaminants at a faster rate than would larger particles Most field applications of nanoremediation have used nano \n zero-valent iron \n nZVI which may be \n emulsified \n or mixed with another metal to enhance dispersion \n That nanoparticles are highly reactive can mean that they rapidly clump together or react with soil particles or other material in the environment limiting their dispersal to target contaminants \n Some of the important challenges currently limiting nanoremediation technologies include identifying coatings or other formulations that increase dispersal of the nanoparticle agents to better reach target contaminants while limiting any potential toxicity to bioremediation agents wildlife or people \n citation needed \n Bioremediation \n Bioremediation \n is a process that treats a polluted area either by altering environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms or through natural microorganism activity resulting in the degradation of the target pollutants Broad categories of \n bioremediation \n include \n biostimulation \n bioaugmentation \n and natural recovery \n natural attenuation \n Bioremediation \n is either done on the contaminated site in situ or after the removal of contaminated soils at another more controlled site ex situ \n In the past it has been difficult to turn to bioremediation as an implemented policy solution as lack of adequate production of remediating microbes led to little options for implementation Those that manufacture microbes for bioremediation must be approved by the EPA however the EPA traditionally has been more cautious about negative externalities that may or may not arise from the introduction of these species One of their concerns is that the toxic chemicals would lead to the microbe's gene degredation which would then be passed on to other harmful bacteria creating more issues if the pathogens evolve the ability to feed off of pollutants \n Collapsing air microbubbles \n Cleaning of oil contaminated sediments with self collapsing air microbubbles have been recently explored as a chemical free technology Air microbubbles generated in water without adding any surfactant could be used to clean oil contaminated sediments This technology holds promise over the use of chemicals mainly surfactant for traditional washing of oil contaminated sediments \n Community consultation and information \n In preparation for any significant remediation there should be extensive community consultation The proponent should both present information to and seek information from the community The proponent needs to learn about \"sensitive\" future uses like childcare schools hospitals and playgrounds as well as community concerns and interests information Consultation should be open on a group basis so that each member of the community is informed about issues they may not have individually thought about An independent chairperson acceptable to both the proponent and the community should be engaged at proponent expense if a fee is required Minutes of meetings including questions asked and the answers to them and copies of presentations by the proponent should be available both on the \n internet \n and at a local library even a school library or community centre \n citation needed \n Incremental health risk \n Incremental health risk is the increased \n risk \n that a receptor normally a human being living nearby will face from the lack of a remediation project The use of \n incremental \n health risk is based on \n carcinogenic \n and other e g \n mutagenic \n teratogenic \n effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in \n cancer \n In some \n jurisdictions \n this is in but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is in A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions or if other projects exist at the same time causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through \n car accidents \n or \n tobacco smoking \n citation needed \n Emissions standards \n Standards are set for the levels of dust noise odour emissions to air and groundwater and discharge to sewers or waterways of all chemicals of concern or chemicals likely to be produced during the remediation by processing of the contaminants These are compared against both natural background levels in the area and standards for areas zoned as nearby areas are zoned and against standards used in other recent remediations Just because the emission is emanating from an area zoned industrial does not mean that in a nearby residential area there should be permitted any exceedances of the appropriate residential standards \n citation needed \n Monitoring for compliance against each standards is critical to ensure that exceedances are detected and reported both to authorities and the local community \n citation needed \n Enforcement is necessary to ensure that continued or significant breaches result in fines or even a \n jail \n sentence \n for the polluter \n citation needed \n Penalties must be significant as otherwise fines are treated as a normal expense of doing business Compliance must be cheaper than to have continuous breaches \n citation needed \n Transport and emergency safety assessment \n Assessment should be made of the risks of operations transporting contaminated material disposal of waste which may be contaminated including workers' clothes and a formal emergency response plan should be developed Every worker and visitor entering the site should have a safety induction personalised to their involvement with the site \n citation needed \n Impacts of funding remediation \n The rezoning is often resisted by local communities and local government because of the adverse effects on the local amenity of the remediation and the new development The main impacts during remediation are noise dust odour and incremental health risk Then there is the noise dust and traffic of developments Then there is the impact on local traffic

Industrial Revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and \n wastes \n into local streams that served as the water supply \n King Edward I \n of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in \n London \n in after its smoke became a problem \n But the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow \n It was the \n industrial revolution \n that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today London also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the \n Great Stink \n on the \n Thames \n of which led to construction of the \n London sewerage system \n soon afterward Pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded view ability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem Reformers began to demand sewer systems and clean water \n In the sanitary conditions in Berlin were among the worst in Europe \n August Bebel \n recalled conditions before a modern \n sewer \n system was built in the late 1870s \n \"Waste-water from the houses collected in the gutters running alongside the curbs and emitted a

unbelievably primitive As a metropolis Berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after \" \n The primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital and the Imperial German government brought in its scientists engineers and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies but to forge Berlin as the world's model city A British expert in concluded that Berlin represented \"the most complete application of science order and method of public life \" adding \"it is a marvel of civic administration the most modern and most perfectly organized city

in the early twentieth century as \n progressive reformers \n took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning water pollution caused by bad sanitation and street pollution caused by the million horses who worked in American cities in generating large quantities of urine and manure As historian Martin Melosi notes The generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as \"miracles of cleanliness \" \n By the 1940s however automobile-caused smog was a major issue in Los Angeles \n Other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century when the short

such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming Most recently the term \n persistent organic pollutant \n POP has come to describe a group of chemicals such as \n PBDEs \n and \n PFCs \n among others Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the Arctic demonstrating diffusion and \n bioaccumulation \n after only a relatively brief period of widespread use \n A much more recently discovered problem is the \n Great Pacific Garbage Patch \n a huge concentration of plastics \n chemical sludge \n and other \n debris \n which has been collected into a large area of the Pacific Ocean by the \n North Pacific Gyre \n This is a less well known pollution problem than the others described above but nonetheless has multiple and serious consequences such as increasing wildlife mortality the spread of invasive species and human ingestion of toxic chemicals Organizations such as \n Gyres \n have researched the pollution and along with artists like \n Marina DeBris \n are working toward publicizing the issue \n Pollution introduced by light at night is becoming a global problem more severe in urban centres but nonetheless contaminating also large territories far away from towns \n Growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to \n environmentalism \n and the \n environmental movement \n which generally seek to limit \n human impact on the environment \n Forms of pollution \n The \n Lachine Canal \n in \n Montreal \n Quebec \n Canada \n Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage \n The major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular \n contaminant \n relevant to each of them \n Air pollution \n the release of chemicals and \n particulates \n into the atmosphere Common gaseous pollutants include \n carbon monoxide \n sulfur dioxide \n chlorofluorocarbons \n CFCs and \n nitrogen oxides \n produced by \n industry \n and motor vehicles Photochemical \n ozone \n and \n smog \n are created as nitrogen oxides and \n hydrocarbons \n react to sunlight \n Particulate matter \n or fine dust is characterized by their \n micrometre \n size PM \n to PM \n Light pollution \n includes light trespass \n over-illumination \n and \n astronomical \n interference \n Littering \n the criminal throwing of inappropriate man-made objects unremoved onto public and private properties \n Noise pollution \n which encompasses \n roadway noise \n aircraft noise \n industrial noise \n as well as high-intensity \n sonar \n Soil contamination \n occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage Among the most significant \n soil contaminants \n are \n hydrocarbons \n heavy metals \n MTBE \n herbicides \n pesticides \n and \n chlorinated hydrocarbons \n Radioactive contamination \n resulting from 20th century activities in \n atomic physics \n such as nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons research manufacture and deployment See \n alpha emitters \n and \n actinides in the environment \n Thermal pollution \n is a \n temperature \n change in natural water bodies caused by human influence such as use of water as coolant in a power plant \n Visual pollution \n which can refer to the presence of overhead \n power lines \n motorway \n billboards \n scarred \n landforms \n as from \n strip mining \n open storage of trash \n municipal solid waste \n or \n space debris \n Water pollution \n by the discharge of \n wastewater \n from commercial and \n industrial waste \n intentionally or through spills into \n surface waters \n discharges of untreated domestic \n sewage \n and chemical contaminants such as \n chlorine \n from treated sewage release of \n waste \n and contaminants into \n surface runoff \n flowing to surface waters including \n urban runoff \n and agricultural runoff which may contain chemical \n fertilizers \n and \n pesticides \n waste disposal \n and leaching into \n groundwater \n eutrophication \n and littering \n Plastic pollution \n involves the \n accumulation of plastic products \n in the environment that adversely affects wildlife wildlife habitat or humans \n Pollutants \n Pollutant \n A pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air water or soil Three factors determine the severity of a pollutant its chemical nature the concentration and the persistence \n Cost of pollution \n Pollution has cost \n Manufacturing activities that cause \n air pollution \n impose health and clean-up costs on the whole of society whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own homes A manufacturing activity that causes air pollution is an example of a negative \n externality \n in production A negative externality in production occurs when a firms production reduces the well-being of others who are not compensated by the firm \" \n For example if a laundry firm exists near a polluting steel manufacturing firm there will be increased costs for the laundry firm because of the dirt and smoke produced by the steel manufacturing firm \n If external costs exist such as those created by pollution the manufacturer will choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the manufacturer were required to pay all associated environmental costs Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self an element of \n externalization \n is involved If there are external benefits such as in \n public safety \n less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others However goods and services that involve negative externalities in production such as those that produce pollution tend to be over-produced and underpriced since the externality is not being priced into the market \n Pollution can also create costs for the firms producing the pollution Sometimes firms choose or are forced by regulation to reduce the amount of pollution that they are producing The associated costs of doing this are called abatement costs or \n marginal abatement costs \n if measured by each additional unit \n In pollution abatement capital expenditures and operating costs in the US amounted to nearly $27 million \n Socially Optimal Level of Pollution \n Society derives some indirect \n utility \n from pollution otherwise there would be no incentive to pollute This utility comes from the consumption of goods and services that create pollution Therefore it is important that policymakers attempt to balance these indirect benefits with the costs of pollution in order to achieve an efficient outcome \n A visual comparison of the free market and socially optimal outcomes \n It is possible to use \n environmental economics \n to determine which level of pollution is deemed the social optimum For economists pollution is an external cost and occurs only when one or more individuals suffer a loss of welfare however there exists a socially optimal level of pollution at which \n welfare \n is maximized \n This is because consumers derive utility from the good or service manufactured which will outweigh the \n social cost \n of pollution until a certain point At this point the damage of one extra unit of pollution to society the \n marginal cost \n of pollution is exactly equal to the \n marginal benefit \n of consuming one more unit of the good or service \n In markets with pollution or other negative externalities in production the \n free market \n equilibrium will not account for the costs of pollution on society \n If the social costs of pollution are higher than the private costs incurred by the firm then the true supply curve will be higher The point at which the social marginal cost and market \n demand \n intersect gives the socially optimal level of pollution At this point the quantity will be lower and the price will be higher in comparison to the free market equilibrium \n Therefore the free market outcome could be considered a \n market failure \n because it does not maximize efficiency \n This model can be used as a basis to evaluate different methods of internalizing the externality Some examples include \n tariffs \n a \n carbon tax \n and \n cap and trade \n systems \n Sources and causes \n Play media \n Air pollution produced by ships may alter clouds affecting global temperatures \n Air pollution comes from both natural and human-made anthropogenic sources However globally human-made pollutants from combustion construction mining agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation \n Motor vehicle emissions \n are one of the leading causes of air pollution \n China \n United States \n Russia \n India \n Mexico \n and \n Japan \n are the world leaders in air pollution emissions Principal stationary pollution sources include \n chemical plants \n coal-fired \n power plants \n oil refineries \n petrochemical \n plants \n nuclear waste \n disposal activity incinerators large livestock farms dairy cows pigs poultry etc \n PVC \n factories metals production factories plastics factories and other \n heavy industry \n Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides \n About million metric tons of \n hazardous wastes \n are generated each year \n The United States alone produces about million metric tons \n Americans constitute less than 5% of the \n world's population \n but produce roughly 25% of the worlds \n CO \n and generate approximately 30% of \n worlds waste \n In \n China \n has overtaken the United States as the world's biggest producer of CO \n while still far behind based on per capita pollution - ranked 78th among the world's nations \n An industrial area with a power plant south of \n Yangzhou \n 's downtown \n China \n In February a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC representing the work of scientists economists and policymakers from more than countries said that humans have been the primary cause of global warming since Humans have ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the consequences of global warming a major climate report concluded But to change the climate the transition from fossil fuels like coal and oil needs to occur within decades according to the final report this year from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC \n Some of the more common \n soil \n contaminants are \n chlorinated hydrocarbons \n CFH \n heavy metals \n such as \n chromium \n cadmium \n found in rechargeable \n batteries \n and \n lead \n found in lead \n paint \n aviation fuel \n and still in some countries \n gasoline \n MTBE \n zinc \n arsenic \n and \n benzene \n In a series of press reports culminating in a book called \n Fateful Harvest \n unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals Ordinary municipal \n landfills \n are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment and often groundwater emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted especially substances illegally discarded there or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U S or EU There have also been some unusual releases of \n polychlorinated dibenzodioxins \n commonly called \n dioxins \n for simplicity such as \n TCDD \n Pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster For example \n hurricanes \n often involve water contamination from sewage and \n petrochemical \n spills from ruptured \n boats \n or \n automobiles \n Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal \n oil rigs \n or \n refineries \n are involved Some sources of pollution such as \n nuclear power \n plants or \n oil tankers \n can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur \n In the case of \n noise pollution \n the dominant source class

toxic air water soils and workplaces kill nine million people annually which is triple the number of deaths caused by AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined and times higher than deaths caused by wars and other forms of human violence \n The study concluded that \"pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the \n Anthropocene \n era Pollution endangers the stability of the Earths

earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence The attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of \n natural selection \n These would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately species extinction Processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations At the extremes for any form of life consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival \n For humankind the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts Short of survival human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards Since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable Common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include \n automobile emissions control \n industrial exposure e g \n Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n OSHA \n PELs \n toxicology \n e g \n LD \n and \n medicine \n e g \n medication \n and \n radiation \n doses \n \"The solution to pollution is dilution\" is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful \n It is well-suited to some other modern locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and \n hazardous material \n release emergency management But it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases \n Such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative human population and densities were lower technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign But these are often no longer the case Furthermore advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before The use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency to the principle of probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or infeasible In addition consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence \n Yet in the absence of a superseding principle this older approach predominates practices throughout the world It is the basis by which to gauge concentrations of effluent for legal release exceeding which penalties are assessed or restrictions applied One such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non-hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process \n Migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be

term for all activities aiming to control the existence growth and proliferation of \n contamination \n in certain areas Contamination control may refer to the atmosphere as well as to surfaces to particulate matter as well as to microbes and to contamination prevention as well as to \n decontamination \n Contamination control measures at a premier lens manufacturer \n Carl Zeiss \n Flooring in a material handling area at the pharmaceutical company Lille France \n Gowning area at \n Alcatel \n London \n UK \n Function \n Usage \n Types of contamination \n The effects of contamination \n Types \n Sticky mats \n Copper alloy surfaces \n Function \n The aim of all contamination control activities is to permanently ensure a sufficient level of cleanliness in controlled environments This is accomplished by maintaining reducing or eradicating \n viable \n and non-viable contamination for either sanitary purposes or in order to maintain an efficient rate of production \n Usage \n One of the most common environments that incorporates contamination control into its standards protocol is the \n cleanroom \n There are many preventive procedures in place within a cleanroom environment They include subjecting cleanroom staff to strict clothing regulations and there is often a gowning room where the staff can change clothes under \n sterile \n conditions so as to prevent any \n particulates \n from entering from the outside environment Certain areas in the cleanroom have more stringent measures than others packaging areas corridors gowning rooms and transfer hatches incorporate strict contamination control measures in order to maintain cleanroom standards \n Contamination control is also an important asset for industrial \n laboratories \n in the \n pharmaceutical \n and life science sectors Other places of use include automotive paint shops entrances to industrial kitchens and food service providers many manufacturing areas and \n electronic component \n assembly areas \n More recently effective contamination control has been a concern for laboratories and other sensitive environments as a bio-security \n crisis management \n measure Some \n banks \n and \n insurance \n companies use contamination control products as part of their \n disaster management \n protocols Preventive measures are devised as preparation for combating potential \n pandemics \n or the proliferation of \n biohazards \n in any potential terrorist attack \n Types of contamination \n Beside particulate matter such as ions and molecules the most common types of contamination are \n People Hair fibre particles from bodies and clothes also poor hygiene \n Environment Dust particles contaminated air work surfaces gases movement ceilings walls and floors \n

processes experiments or production activities as well as to the individuals involved Unguarded proliferation of contamination can quickly lead to product damage yield reduction \n product recalls \n and other outcomes highly detrimental to business Products in a range of industries are recalled due to ineffective contamination control systems \n Based on this evidence it could be argued that many businesses are not adequately protecting themselves from the harmful effects of contamination and many products in many industries are being recalled due to unsafe manufacturing processes \n Types \n Body movement causes contamination and protective clothing such as hats \n cleanroom suits \n and \n face masks \n are accordingly basic items of contamination control Apart from people another common way for contamination to enter is on the wheels of trolleys used to transport equipment \n To prevent airborne contamination high-efficiency particulate air \n HEPA \n filters airlocks and cleanroom suits are used HEPA filtration systems used in the medical sector incorporate high-energy ultraviolet light units to kill the live bacteria and viruses trapped by the filter media These measures restrict the number of particulates within the atmosphere and inhibit the growth of those that are viable \n Sticky mats \n Sticky mat \n Studies by 3M show that over 80% of contamination enters the cleanroom through entrances and exits mostly at or near floor level \n To combat this problem suitable flooring systems are used that effectively attract retain and inhibit the growth of viable organisms Studies show that the most effective type of flooring system is one of polymer composition \n Polymer mats are particularly effective due to their suppleness \n as they allow for more contact with serrations on shoes and wheels and can accommodate more particles while still remaining effective An \n electrostatic potential \n adds to the effectiveness of this type of contamination control as it enables particles to be retained until the flooring is cleaned This method of attracting and retaining particles is more effective than mats with an active \n adhesive \n coating which needs to be peeled and is often not as supple \n As long as the tack level of the mat is greater than the donor's such as a foot or a wheel the contamination touching the surface will be removed Very high tack surfaces pose a contamination threat because they are prone to pulling off overshoe protection \n Polymeric flooring is produced to ensure a higher level of tackiness than the surfaces it comes into contact with without causing discomfort and potentially damaging 'stickiness' \n Copper alloy surfaces \n Main articles \n Antimicrobial properties of copper \n and \n Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces \n Copper-alloy surfaces have intrinsic properties which effectively and quickly destroy microbes and they are being installed in healthcare facilities and in a subway transit system as a protective public health measure in addition to regular cleaning The \n United States Environmental Protection Agency \n EPA has approved the registration of different \n

spreading of disease \n Hygiene practices vary and what is considered acceptable in one \n culture \n might not be acceptable in another \n In the manufacturing of food pharmaceutical cosmetic and other products good hygiene is a critical component of \n quality assurance \n The terms \n cleanliness \n and hygiene are often used interchangeably which can cause confusion In general hygiene refers to practices that prevent spread of disease-causing organisms Cleaning processes e g handwashing remove infectious microbes as well as dirt and soil and are thus often the means to achieve hygiene \n Other uses of the term appear in phrases including \n body hygiene personal hygiene \n sleep hygiene \n mental hygiene \n dental hygiene \n and \n occupational hygiene \n used in connection with \n public health \n Hygiene \n is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion and preservation of health \n Medical hygiene \n Medical hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes the spread of disease \n Medical hygiene practices include \n Isolation \n or \n quarantine \n of infectious persons or materials to prevent spread of infection \n Sterilization \n of instruments used in \n surgical procedures \n Use of protective clothing and barriers such as \n masks \n gowns \n caps \n eyewear \n and \n gloves \n Proper \n bandaging \n and \n dressing \n of \n injuries \n Safe \n disposal \n of \n medical waste \n Disinfection of reusables i e linen pads uniforms \n Scrubbing up hand-washing especially in an operating room but in more general health-care settings as well where diseases can be transmitted \n Most of these practices were developed in the 19th century and were well established by the mid-20th century Some procedures such as disposal of \n medical waste \n were refined in response to late-20th century disease outbreaks notably \n AIDS \n and \n Ebola \n Home and everyday hygiene \n Home hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices that prevent or minimize the spread of disease at home and other everyday settings such as social settings public transport the workplace public places etc \n Hygiene in a variety of settings plays an important role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases \n It includes procedures used in a variety of domestic situations such as hand hygiene respiratory hygiene food and water hygiene general home hygiene hygiene of environmental sites and surfaces care of domestic animals and home health care the care of those who are at greater risk of infection \n At present these components of hygiene tend to be regarded as separate issues although based on the same underlying microbiological principles Preventing the spread of diseases means breaking the chain of infection transmission Simply if the chain of infection is broken infection cannot spread In response to the need for effective codes of hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a \n risk-based approach \n based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point \n HACCP \n also referred to as \"targeted hygiene \" Targeted hygiene is based on identifying the routes of pathogen spread in the home and introducing hygiene practices at critical times to break the chain of infection \n The main sources of infection in the home \n are people who are carriers or are infected foods particularly raw foods and water and domestic animals in the U S more than 50% of homes have one or more pets \n Sites that accumulate stagnant watersuch as sinks toilets waste pipes cleaning tools face clothsreadily support microbial growth and can become secondary reservoirs of infection though species are mostly those that threaten \"at risk\" groups \n Pathogens \n potentially infectious bacteria viruses etc colloquially called \"germs\" are constantly shed from these sources via mucous membranes feces vomit skin scales etc Thus when circumstances combine people are exposed either directly or via food or water and can develop an infection \n The main \"highways\" for the spread of pathogens in the home are the hands hand and food contact surfaces and cleaning cloths and utensils Pathogens can also be spread via clothing and household linens such as \n towels \n Utilities such as toilets and wash basins for example were invented for dealing safely with human waste but still have risks associated with them Safe disposal of human waste is a fundamental need poor \n sanitation \n is a primary cause of diarrhea disease in low income communities Respiratory viruses and fungal spores are spread via the air \n Good home hygiene means engaging in hygiene practices at critical points to break the chain of infection \n Because the \"infectious dose\" for some pathogens can be very small 10-100 viable units or even less for some viruses and infection can result from direct transfer of pathogens from surfaces via hands or food to the mouth nasal mucosa or the eye 'hygienic cleaning' procedures should be sufficient to eliminate pathogens from critical surfaces \n Hygienic cleaning can be done through \n Mechanical removal i e cleaning using a \n soap \n or \n detergent \n To be effective as a hygiene measure this process must be followed by thorough rinsing under running water to remove pathogens from the surface \n Using a process or product that inactivates the pathogens in situ Pathogen kill is achieved using a \"micro-biocidal\" product i e a \n disinfectant \n or \n antibacterial \n product \n waterless hand sanitizer \n or by application of heat \n In some cases combined pathogen removal with kill is used e g laundering of clothing and household linens such as towels and bed linen \n Handwashing \n Handwashing \n A tippy tap for handwashing after using a \n urine-diverting dry toilet \n in Pumpuentsa Ecuador \n Hand hygiene is defined as \n handwashing \n or washing hands and nails with soap and water or using a \n waterless hand sanitizer \n Hand hygiene is central to preventing spread of infectious diseases in home and everyday life settings \n In situations where handwashing with soap is not an option e g when in a public place with no access to wash facilities a \n waterless hand sanitizer \n such as an \n alcohol hand gel \n can be used They can be used in addition to handwashing to minimize risks when caring for \"at risk\" groups To be effective alcohol hand gels should contain not less than 60%v/v alcohol \n The \n World Health Organization \n recommends handwashing with ash if soap is not available in emergencies \n schools without access to soap \n and other difficult situations like post-emergencies where use of clean sand is recommended too \n Use of ash is common in rural areas of developing countries and has in experiments been shown at least as effective as soap for removing pathogens \n Respiratory hygiene \n Correct respiratory and \n hand hygiene \n when coughing and sneezing reduces the spread of pathogens particularly during the \n cold \n and \n flu \n season \n Carry tissues and use them to catch coughs and sneezes \n Dispose of tissues as soon as possible \n Clean your hands by \n handwashing \n or using an alcohol \n hand sanitizer \n Food hygiene at home \n Food hygiene \n Food hygiene is concerned with the hygiene practices that prevent food poisoning The five key principles of food hygiene according to \n WHO \n are \n Prevent contaminating food with mixing chemicals spreading from people and animals \n Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods \n Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill pathogens \n Store food at the proper temperature \n Use safe water and raw materials \n Hygiene in the kitchen bathroom and toilet \n Routine cleaning of hand food drinking water sites and surfaces such as \n toilet seats \n and \n flush \n handles door and tap handles work surfaces bath and basin surfaces in the kitchen \n bathroom \n and \n toilet \n reduces the risk of spread of pathogens \n The infection risk from \n flush toilets \n is not high provided they are properly maintained although some splashing and \n aerosol \n formation can occur during flushing particularly when someone has diarrhea Pathogens can survive in the scum or scale left behind on baths and wash basins after washing and bathing \n Water left stagnant in the pipes of showers can be contaminated with pathogens that become airborne when the shower is turned on If a shower has not been used for some time it should be left to run at a hot temperature for a few minutes before use \n Thorough cleaning is important in preventing the spread of fungal infections \n Molds can live on wall and floor tiles and on shower curtains Mold can be responsible for infections cause allergic responses deteriorate/damage surfaces and cause unpleasant odors Primary sites of fungal growth are inanimate surfaces including carpets and soft furnishings \n Air-borne fungi are usually associated with damp conditions poor ventilation or closed air systems \n Laundry hygiene \n Laundry hygiene involves practices that prevent disease and its spread via soiled clothing and household linens such as towels \n Items most likely to be contaminated with pathogens are those that come into direct contact with the body e g underwear personal towels facecloths nappies Cloths or other fabric items used during food preparation or for cleaning the toilet or cleaning up material such as faeces or vomit are a particular risk \n Microbiological and epidemiological data indicates that clothing and household linens etc are a risk factor for infection transmission in home and everyday life settings as well as institutional settings The lack of quantitative data linking contaminated clothing to infection in the domestic setting makes it difficult to assess the extent of this risk \n It also indicates that risks from clothing and household linens are somewhat less than those associated with hands hand contact and food contact surfaces and cleaning cloths but even so these risks needs to be managed through effective laundering practices In the home this routine should be carried out as part of a multibarrier approach to hygiene which includes hand food respiratory and other hygiene practices \n Infectious diseases risks from contaminated clothing etc can increase significantly under certain conditions e g in healthcare situations in hospitals care homes and the domestic setting where someone has diarrhoea vomiting or a skin or wound infection It increases in circumstances where someone has reduced immunity to infection \n Hygiene measures including laundry hygiene are an important part of reducing spread of antibiotic resistant strains \n In the community otherwise healthy people can become persistent skin carriers of \n MRSA \n or faecal carriers of enterobacteria strains which can carry multi-antibiotic resistance factors e g NDM-1 or ESBL-producing strains The risks are not apparent until for example they are admitted to hospital when they can become \"self infected\" with their own resistant organisms following a surgical procedure As persistent nasal skin or bowel carriage in the healthy population spreads \"silently\" across the world the risks from resistant strains in both hospitals and the community increases \n In particular the data indicates that clothing and household linens are a risk factor for spread of S aureus including MRSA and PVL-producing MRSA strains and that effectiveness of laundry processes may be an important factor in defining the rate of community spread of these strains \n Experience in the United States suggests that these strains are transmissible within families and in community settings such as prisons schools and sport teams Skin-to-skin contact including unabraded skin and indirect contact with contaminated objects such as towels sheets and sports equipment seem to represent the mode of transmission \n During laundering temperature and detergent work to reduce microbial contamination levels on fabrics Soil and microbes from fabrics are severed and suspended in the wash water These are then \"washed away\" during the rinse and spin cycles In addition to physical removal micro-organisms can be killed by thermal inactivation which increases as the temperature is increased Chemical inactivation of microbes by the surfactants and activated oxygen-based bleach used in detergents contributes to the hygiene effectiveness of laundering Adding hypochlorite bleach in the washing process achieves inactivation of microbes A number of other factors can contribute including drying and ironing \n Laundry detergents contain a mix of ingredients including surfactants builders optical brighteners etc Cleaning action arises primarily from the action of the surfactants and other ingredients which are designed to maximise release and suspension of dirt and microbes into the wash liquid together with enzymes and/or an activated oxygen-based bleach which digest and remove stains Although activated oxygen bleach is included in many powder detergents to digest and remove stains it produces some chemical inactivation of bacteria fungi and viruses As a rule of thumb powders and tablets normally contain an activated oxygen bleach but liquids and all products liquid or powder used for \"coloureds\" do not Surfactants also exert some chemical inactivation action against certain species although the extent of their action is not known \n In the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene IFH reviewed some studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 70C under varying conditions \n A key finding was the lack of standardisation and control within studies and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time number of rinses etc The consequent variability in the data i e the reduction in contamination on fabrics obtained in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence based on currently available data As a result there is significant variability in the recommendations for hygienic laundering of clothing etc given by different agencies \n Of concern is recent data suggesting that in reality modern domestic washing machines do not reach the temperature specified on the machine controls \n Medical hygiene at home \n Medical hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices that prevents or minimizes disease and the spreading of disease in relation to administering medical care to those who are infected or who are more \"at risk\" of infection in the home Across the world governments are increasingly under pressure to fund the level of healthcare that people expect Care of increasing numbers of patients in the community including at home is one answer but can be fatally undermined by inadequate infection control in the home Increasingly all of these \"at-risk\" groups are cared for at home by a carer who may be a household member who thus requires a good knowledge of hygiene People with reduced immunity to infection who are looked after at home make up an increasing proportion of the population currently up to 20% \n The largest proportion are the elderly who have co-morbidities which reduce their immunity to infection It also includes the very young patients discharged from hospital taking immuno-suppressive drugs or using invasive systems etc For patients discharged from hospital or being treated at home special \"medical hygiene\" see above procedures may need to be performed for them e g catheter or dressing replacement which puts them at higher risk of infection \n Antiseptics \n may be applied to cuts wounds abrasions of the skin to prevent the entry of harmful bacteria that can cause sepsis Day-to-day hygiene practices other than special medical hygiene procedures \n are no different for those at increased risk of infection than for other family members The difference is that if hygiene practices are not correctly carried out the risk of infection is much greater \n Disinfectants and antibacterials in home hygiene \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this section \n by \n adding citations to reliable sources \n Unsourced material may be challenged and \n removed \n September \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Chemical disinfectants \n are products that kill \n pathogens \n If the product is a disinfectant the label on the product should say \"disinfectant\" or \"kills\" pathogens Some commercial products e g bleaches even though they are technically disinfectants say that they \"kill pathogens\" but are not actually labelled as \"disinfectants\" Not all disinfectants kill all types of pathogens All disinfectants kill bacteria called bactericidal Some also kill fungi fungicidal bacterial spores sporicidal or viruses virucidal \n An \n antibacterial \n product is a product that acts against bacteria in some unspecified way Some products labelled \"antibacterial\" kill bacteria while others may contain a concentration of active ingredient that only prevent them multiplying It is therefore important to check whether the product label states that it \"kills\" bacteria \" An antibacterial is not necessarily anti-fungal or anti-viral unless this is stated on the label \n The term \n sanitizer \n has been used to define substances that both clean and disinfect More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that disinfect the hands \n alcohol hand sanitizers \n Alcohol hand sanitizers however are not considered to be effective on soiled hands \n The term \n biocide \n is a broad term for a substance that kills inactivates or otherwise controls living organisms It includes \n antiseptics \n and disinfectants which combat micro-organisms and \n pesticides \n Home hygiene in developing countries \n In \n developing countries \n universal access to water and \n sanitation \n has been seen as the essential step in reducing the preventable infectious diseases burden but it is now clear that this is best achieved by programs that integrate hygiene promotion with improvements in water quality and availability and \n sanitation \n This approach has been integrated into the \n Sustainable Development Goal \n Number whose second target states \"By achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end \n open defecation \n paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations\" \n Due to their close linkages water sanitation hygiene are together abbreviated and funded under the term \n WASH \n in \n development cooperation \n About million people die every year due to diarrheal diseases most of them are children less than years of age \n The most affected are the populations in developing countries living in extreme conditions of poverty normally peri-urban dwellers or rural inhabitants Providing access to sufficient quantities of safe water the provision of facilities for a sanitary disposal of excreta and introducing sound hygiene behaviors are of capital importance to reduce the burden of disease caused by these risk factors \n Research shows that if widely practiced \n hand washing with soap \n could reduce diarrhea by almost fifty percent \n and respiratory infections by nearly twenty-five percent \n Hand washing with soap also reduces the incidence of skin diseases \n eye infections like trachoma and intestinal worms especially ascariasis and trichuriasis \n Other hygiene practices such as safe disposal of waste surface hygiene and care of domestic animals are important in low income communities to break the chain of infection transmission \n Cleaning of toilets and hand wash facilities is important to prevent odors and make them socially acceptable Social acceptance is an important part of encouraging people to use toilets and wash their hands in situations where \n open defecation \n is still seen as a possible alternative e g in rural areas of some developing countries \n Household water treatment and safe storage \n Household water treatment and safe storage ensure drinking water is safe for consumption These interventions are part of the approach of \n self-supply of water \n for households \n Drinking water quality \n remains a significant problem in developing \n and in developed countries \n even in the European region it is estimated that million people do not have access to \n safe drinking water \n Point-of-use water quality interventions can reduce diarrheal disease in communities where water quality is poor or in emergency situations where there is a breakdown in water supply \n Since water can become contaminated during storage at home e g by contact with contaminated hands or using dirty storage vessels \n safe storage of water \n in the home is important \n Methods for treatment of drinking water \n include \n Chemical disinfection using chlorine or iodine \n Boiling \n Filtration using ceramic filters \n Solar disinfection - Solar disinfection is an effective method especially when no chemical disinfectants are available \n UV irradiation - community or household UV systems may be batch or flow-though The lamps can be suspended above the water channel or submerged in the water flow \n Combined flocculation/disinfection systems available as sachets of powder that act by coagulating and flocculating sediments in water followed by release of chlorine \n Multibarrier methods Some systems use two or more of the above treatments in combination or in succession to optimize efficacy \n Personal hygiene \n Swedish ad for toiletries 1905/1906 \n Body hygiene kit \n Personal hygiene involves those practices performed by an individual to care for one's bodily health and well being through cleanliness Motivations for personal hygiene practice include reduction of personal illness healing from personal illness optimal health and sense of well being social acceptance and prevention of spread of illness to others What is considered proper personal hygiene can be cultural-specific and may change over time \n Other practices that are generally considered proper hygiene include bathing regularly washing hands regularly and especially before handling food washing scalp hair keeping hair short or removing hair wearing clean clothing brushing teeth cutting finger nails besides other practices Some practices are gender-specific such as by a woman during her menstrual cycle \n People tend to develop a routine for attending to their personal hygiene needs Other personal hygienic practices would include covering one's mouth when coughing disposal of soiled tissues appropriately making sure toilets are clean and making sure food handling areas are clean besides other practices Some cultures do not kiss or shake hands to reduce transmission of bacteria by contact \n Personal grooming \n extends personal hygiene as it pertains to the maintenance of a good personal and public appearance which need not necessarily be hygienic It may involve for example using deodorants or perfume shaving or combing besides other practices \n Excessive body hygiene \n Excessive body hygiene is one example of \n obsessive compulsive disorder \n Excessive body hygiene and allergies \n The \n hygiene hypothesis \n was first formulated in by Strachan who observed that there was an inverse relationship between family size and development of atopic allergic disorders the more children in a family the less likely they were to develop these \n allergies \n From this he hypothesized that a lack of exposure to \"infections\" in early childhood transmitted by contact with older siblings could be a cause of the rapid rise in atopic disorders over the last to years Strachan further proposed that the reason why this exposure no longer occurs is not only because of the trend towards smaller families but also \"improved household amenities and higher standards of \n personal cleanliness \n \" \n Although there is substantial evidence that some microbial exposures in early childhood can in some way protect against allergies there is no evidence that humans need exposure to harmful microbes infection or that it is necessary to suffer a clinical infection \n Nor is there evidence that hygiene measures such as hand washing food hygiene etc are linked to increased susceptibility to \n atopic disease \n If this is the case there is no conflict between the goals of preventing infection and minimising allergies A consensus is now developing among experts that the answer lies in more fundamental changes in lifestyle etc that have led to decreased exposure to certain microbial or other species such as helminths that are important for development of immuno-regulatory mechanisms \n There is still much uncertainty as to which lifestyle factors are involved \n Although media coverage of the hygiene hypothesis has declined a strong collective mindset has become established that dirt is healthy and hygiene somehow unnatural This has caused concern among health professionals that everyday life hygiene behaviours which are the foundation of public health are being undermined In response to the need for effective hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a \"risk-based\" or targeted approach to home hygiene that seeks to ensure that hygiene measures are focussed on the places and at the times most critical for infection transmission \n Whilst targeted hygiene was originally developed as an effective approach to hygiene practice it also seeks as far as possible to sustain \"normal\" levels of exposure to the microbial flora of our environment to the extent that is important to build a balanced immune system \n Excessive body hygiene of internal ear canals \n Earwax \n Excessive body hygiene of the \n ear canals \n can result in infection or irritation The ear canals require less body hygiene care than other parts of the body because they are sensitive and the body adequately cares for them Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning that is there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries flakes and falls out \n Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of \n earwax \n can reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed \n Excessive application of soaps creams and ointments can adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin For examples soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol vitamin D3 and external substances can be absorbed to disturb natural hormonal balances \n citation needed \n Culinary food hygiene \n Food safety \n Culinary hygiene pertains to the practices related to food

\n Engels \n claimed to have identified six successive stages of the development of these material conditions in \n Western Europe \n citation needed \n In contrast to many of his followers Marx made no claim to have produced a master key to \n history \n but rather considered his work a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe As he put it historical materialism is not \"an historico-philosophic theory of the \n marche generale \n imposed by fate upon every people whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself \" \n Private property \n Stages of history \n Primitive communism \n Slave society \n Feudalism \n Capitalism \n Socialism \n Communism \n Cohen's interpretation of Marx \n Private property \n The \n Marxist \n concept of \n private property \n gives the basis for Marx's theory \"Private property\" in the terminology of Marx's time for Marx himself and for Marxists sometimes today does not mean the simple possessions of a person but the ownership of \n productive \n property or property which produces a \n profit \n for the owner \n such as \n corporate \n ownership share ownership land ownership andin the case of \n slave \n societyslave ownership since slaves work the land mines and other means of producing the material means of existence \n Stages of history \n Marx saw that each stage or epoch created a new \n class \n or invention that would lead to its downfall However the downfall would not be an automatically negative event since with each step humanity at large would benefit Each passing stage would therefore raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its own downfall because of internal contradictions and \n class conflicts \n Only the last two epochs are to avoid this fate With socialism stage the final oppressive class is overthrown and society is put under the dictatorship of the proletariat and thus advances into communism stage \n The first three stages are not given particular attention since by Marx's time they had long come to pass As such he does not provide the principles of these stages as he does for capitalism stage and the stages that follow Nonetheless these epochs have common characteristics \n Primitive communism \n The First Stage \n is usually called \n primitive communism \n It has the following characteristics \n Shared property \n there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions The tribe shares everything in order to ensure its survival \n citation needed \n Hunting and gathering \n tribal societies have yet to develop large-scale agriculture and so their survival is a daily struggle \n citation needed \n Proto-democracy \n there is usually no concept of \" \n leadership \n \" yet So tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war the best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth \n citation needed \n The primitive communism stage most likely begins soon after the dawn of humanity itself at the stage where \n fire \n is developed and communal living therefore becomes more convenient \n citation needed \n Primitive communist societies tend to be very small consisting of a maximum of a few hundred members with size being dependent upon the environment In this stage humanity does not differ from any other animal group in that it has not yet found ways to bend nature to its will \n This stage ends with the development of private property \n citation needed \n especially with the development of large-scale agriculture This in turn produces productive property such as cattle and slaves \n citation needed \n Slave society \n The Second Stage \n may be called \n slave society \n considered to be the beginning of \"class society\" where private property appears \n Class \n here the idea of class appears There is always a slave-owning \n ruling class \n and the slaves themselves \n Statism \n the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control the slaves \n Agriculture \n people learn to cultivate plants and rear animals on a large enough scale to support large populations \n Democracy \n and \n authoritarianism \n these opposites develop at the same stage Democracy arises first with the development of the republican \n city-state \n followed by the \n totalitarian \n empire \n Private property \n citizens now own more than personal property Land ownership becomes especially important during a time of agricultural development \n The slave-owning class \"own\" the land and slaves which are the main means of producing wealth whilst the vast majority of people have very little or nothing The propertyless included the slave class slaves who work for no money and in most cases women who were also dispossessed during this period From a Marxist perspective slave society collapsed when it exhausted itself The need to keep conquering more slaves created huge problems such as maintaining the vast empire that resulted i e the \n Roman Empire \n It is ultimately the aristocracy born in this epoch that demolishes it and forces society to step onto the next stage \n Feudalism \n The Third Stage \n may be called \n feudalism \n it appears after slave society collapses This was most obvious during the European \n Middle Ages \n when society moved from slavery to feudalism \n Aristocracy \n the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership \n Theocracy \n this is a time of largely religious rule - when there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life \n Hereditary classes \n castes \n can sometimes form and one's class is determined at birth with no form of advancement This was the case with \n India \n Nation-state \n nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires - sometimes to rebuild themselves into empires once more Note England's transition from a \n province \n to an \n empire \n During feudalism there are many classes such as kings lords and \n serfs \n some little more than slaves Most of these inherit their titles for good or ill At the same time that societies must create all these new classes trade with other nation-states increases rapidly This catalyzes the creation of the \n merchant class \n Out of the merchants' riches a capitalist class emerges within this feudal society However there are immediate conflicts between capitalists and aristocrats The old feudal kings and lords cannot accept the new social changes the capitalists want for fear of destabilizing or reducing their power base among various other reasons that are not all tied to power or money \n These proto-capitalist and capitalist classes are driven by the \n profit motive \n but are prevented from developing further profits by the nature of feudal society in which for instance the serfs are tied to the land and cannot become industrial workers and wage-earners Marx says \n Then begins an epoch of social revolution \n the \n French Revolution \n of the \n English Civil War \n and the \n Glorious Revolution \n of etc since the social and political organization of feudal society or the \n property relations \n of feudalism is preventing the development of the capitalists' productive forces \n Capitalism \n Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development as it was the one he lived on The bulk of his work is devoted to exploring the mechanisms of capitalism which in western society classically arose \"red in tooth and claw\" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement \n Capitalism \n may be considered \n the Fourth Stage \n in the sequence It appears after the \n bourgeois \n revolution when the capitalists overthrow the feudal system Marx sees capitalism as categorized by the following \n Market economy \n In capitalism the entire economy is guided by market forces Supporters of \n laissez-faire \n economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government on the economy under capitalism Marxists however such as \n Lenin \n in his \n Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism \n argue that the capitalist government acts as a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and of the capitalist nation-state particularly in the conquest of markets abroad and also in the direct repression of reactionary/neofeudal movements and of \n proto-socialist \n or socialist movements \n Private property \n The \n means of production \n are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and/or the nobility - rather they are controlled by the bourgeois and the petit-bourgeois classes The \n bourgeoisie \n and the \n petit-bourgeoisie \n control the means of production through commercial enterprises such as \n corporations \n which aim to maximize profit \n Bourgeois democracy \n The bourgeoisie eventually after years of struggle and opposition accepted a form of democratic governance descendent of the elective monarchy system such as the \n Sejm \n of Poland-Lithuania through elected representatives Bourgeois democracy at its beginning had minimum wealth/status requirements and sometimes led to different weight in voting depending on the wealth/status of the voter Historically it has also excluded by force segregation legislation or other means sections of the population such as women slaves ex-slaves ethnic linguistic and religious minorities Eventually the bourgeoisie accepted to extend the right to vote gradually to a large part of the population although this did not necessarily lead to \n universal suffrage \n A democratically elected government today usually only reaches power with heavy monetary support from the bourgeoisie and even if it doesn't act directly on behalf of them is forced to do so by the structure itself \n Wage labor \n In capitalism the proletariat sells its labour to survive and is paid for its productivity The bourgeoisie and its supportive classes propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services In reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivitythe difference forming profit for the employer \n surplus value \n with the medium being manipulable by the elites See \n Industrial reserve army \n In this sense paid employment is exploitation and while working in the production line the workers become \n alienated \n from the product of their work Insofar as the profit-motive drives the economy it is impossible for all workers to be paid for the full value of their labour with the exception of a small \"labour aristocracy\" specialized workers which are paid from the surplus value other workers produce in exchange for their knowledge and loyalty \n Imperialism \n Capitalist states actively seek to conquer dominate or indirectly control other regions or states encouraged and aided by the bourgeoisie in order to gain access to important raw materials but most importantly to provide captive markets for finished products This is done directly through war through the threat of war through the election of a politician aligned with that nation or through the export of capital and eventual control of the victimized state economy The imperialist state's control over other regions or states can play an essential part in the development of the imperialist state's economy and capitalism to the extent the state has money spat \n clarification needed \n directs warfare and other foreign intervention \n Monopolistic tendencies \n Market forces develop monopolies from the most successful or deceitful commercial entities as the market rewards those who smash their opponents through capital war and drives down the profit of those in competition though it can happen that opponents which can't defeat each other or don't want to seek agreements to reduce competition and increase profits \n In capitalism the profit-motive rules and people become freed from serfdom in order to work for the capitalists in exchange for wages The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez-faire practices around the world In the capitalist-controlled parliament laws are made to protect wealth \n But according to Marx capitalism like slave society and feudalism also has critical failings \n internal contradictions \n which will lead to its downfall \n Capital accumulation \n over time leads to increased inequality Additionally since capital demands a return it also leads to increased returns coming from those without capital - the working class Over time the number of work hours which the working class labors \"for itself\" decreases in order to provide returns for an ever-increasing pile of capital controlled by the capitalist class Following the Marxist \n labor theory of value \n this can be seen in how increasing labor productivity in the past years in the United States has been accompanied by stagnant wage growth In average U S labor productivity attributing all productivity to labor in accordance with the labor theory of value was $70 an hour citation needed while the average minimum wage was around $10 an hour citation needed meaning that capital and other costs absorbed 6/7ths of the value produced by the average minimum-wage laborer Marx hypothesized that this asymmetry generates social instability \n The working class to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits is the \"grave digger\" of capitalism The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces The rest is surplus valuethe capitalist's profit which Marx calls the \"unpaid labour of the working class\" Capitalists are forced by technological advances and partially by competition to drive down the wages of the working class in order to increase their own profits and this creates a more direct conflict between these classes and gives rise to the development of \n class consciousness \n in the working class The working class through \n trade-union \n and other struggles becomes conscious of itself as an \n exploited class \n In Marx's view the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class lead the working class to establish its own collective control over productionthe basis of socialist society Marx believed that capitalism always leads to \n monopolies \n and brings the people to poverty yet the fewer the restrictions on the \n free market \n e g from the state and trade unions the sooner it finds itself in crisis \n Socialism \n This section \n contains \n too many or too-lengthy quotations \n for an encyclopedic entry \n Please \n help

phase\" of communism but Lenin points to later remarks of Engels which suggest that what people commonly think of as socialism equates to Marx's \"first phase\" of communism \n citation needed \n Socialism may be categorized by the following \n Common property \n the \n means of production \n are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers This translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production \n Council democracy \n Marx basing himself on a thorough study of \n Paris Commune \n believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes He called this the \n dictatorship of the proletariat \n which overthrowing the dictatorship governance of the bourgeoisie would democratically plan production and the resources of the planet \n Labor vouchers \n Marx explained that since socialism emerges from capitalism it would be \"stamped with its birthmarks\" Economically this translates into the individual worker being awarded according to the \n amount of labor he contributes to society \n Each worker would be given an amount of standardised credit verifying his contribution which he could then exchange for goods produced by other workers \n Marx explains that socialist society having risen from a \n class-conscious \n movement of the vast majority makes such a society one of the vast majority governing their own lives \n The proletarian movement is the self-conscious independent movement of the immense majority in the interest of the immense majority The proletariat the lowest stratum of our present society cannot stir cannot raise itself up without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air \n Now the productive forces are truly free to develop but in a democratically planned way without the vast waste of anarchic capitalist society its wars and its destruction of the planet One of the primary tasks of the workers in the socialist society after placing the means of production into collective ownership is to destroy the \"old state machinery\" Hence the bourgeoisie's parliamentary democracy ceases to exist and \n fiat \n and \n credit money \n are abolished In Marx's view instead of a dictatorship of capital in which rulers are elected only once every few years at best the state is ruled through the dictatorship of the proletariat with the democratically elected workers' \n commune \n to replace the parliament \n The Commune was formed of the municipal councilors chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town responsible and revocable at any time The majority of its members were naturally working men or acknowledged representatives of the working class The police which until then had been the instrument of the Government was at once stripped of its political attributes and turned into the responsible and at all times revocable agent of the Commune So were the officials of all other branches of the administration From the members of the Commune downwards the public service had to be done at workmen's wages The privileges and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves Having once got rid of the standing army and the police the instruments of physical force of the old government the Commune proceeded at once to break the instrument of spiritual suppression the power of the priests The judicial functionaries lost that sham independence they were thenceforward to be elective responsible and revocable \n The commune in Marx and Engels' view modeled after the \n Paris Commune \n has a completely different political character from the parliament Marx explains that it holds legislative-executive power and is subservient only to the workers themselves \n The Commune was to be a working not a parliamentary body executive and legislative at the same time Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was to represent and repress ver- and zertreten the people in parliament universal suffrage was to serve the people constituted in communes as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search for workers foremen and accountants for his business \n Marx explained that since socialism the first stage of communism would be \"in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\" each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ so that the results would still be unequal at this stage although fully supported by \n social provision \n Fiat money \n and credit whose values were determined by anarchic market forces are abolished Instead in his \n Critique of the Gotha Programme \n Marx speculated schematically that from the \"total social product\" there would be deductions for the requirements of production and \"the common satisfaction of needs such as schools health services etc\" which latter deduction \"grows in proportion as the new society develops\" and of course deductions \"for those unable to work etc\" After these deductions the workers could divide up the wealth produced by their labor and everyone could be simply given a \"certificate from society\" which could then be exchanged for products This schematically introduces a means of exchange \"the same principle\" - i e money in socialist society but with the speculative element removed \n In this way each worker is paid \n according to the amount of labor contributed to society \n in other words according to the agreed difficulty length of time and intensity of his labor All goods such as housing for instance are priced in a greater degree according to the amount of labor required to produce them which the individual worker can buy with his labor voucher \n What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor For example the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him his share in it He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor after deducting his labor for the common funds and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form he receives back in another \n Here obviously the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities as far as this is exchange of equal values Content and form are changed because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor and because on the other hand nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals except individual means of consumption But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form \n Only if this new socialist society manages to end the destructiveness of capitalism and leads to a higher quality of life for all will socialist society be successful As socialism raises everyone's quality of life above the precarious existence they knew hitherto providing decent health-care housing child-care and other social provision for all without exception the new socialist society begins to break down the old inevitably pecuniary habits the need for a state apparatus will wither away and the communist organization of society will begin to emerge Socialism in the view of Marxists will succeed in raising the quality of life for all by ending the destructive contradictions which arise in capitalism through conflicts between competing capitalists and competing capitalist nations and ending the need for imperialist conquest for the possession of commodities and markets \n Communism \n Some time after socialism is established society leaps forward and everyone has plenty of personal possessions but no one can exploit another person for private gain through the ownership of vast monopolies and so forth Classes are thus abolished and class society ended Communism will have \n spread across the world \n and will operate \n worldwide \n Eventually the \n state \n will \n \"wither away\" \n and become obsolete as people administer their own lives without the need for governments or laws Thus stateless communism or pure communism which may be considered \n the Sixth Stage \n is established which has the following features \n Statelessness \n there are no governments laws or nations anymore \n Classlessness \n all social classes disappear everyone works for everyone else \n Propertylessness \n there is no money or private property all goods are free to be consumed by anyone who needs them \n In \n The Communist Manifesto \n Marx describes communism as \n When in the course of development class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation the public power will lose its political character Political power properly so called is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled by the force of circumstances to organize itself as a class if by means of a revolution it makes itself the ruling class and as such sweeps away by force the old conditions of production then it will along with these conditions have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class In place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all \n Few applications of historical materialism the philosophical system used by Marxism to explain the past progressions of human society and predict the nature of communism account for a stage beyond communism but Marx suggests that what has ended is only the \"prehistory\" \n of human society now for the first time humankind will no longer be at the mercy of productive forces e g the free market which act independently of their control Instead human beings can plan for the needs of society inclusively democratically by the vast majority who now own and control the means of production collectively By implication only then will the real history of \n human society \n begin \n Cohen's interpretation of Marx \n Karl Marx's Theory of History A Defence \n by \n G A Cohen \n is a key work for the philosophical school of \n Analytical Marxism \n In it Cohen advances a sophisticated technological-determinist interpretation of Marx \"in which history is fundamentally the growth of human productive power and forms of society rise and fall according as they enable or impede that growth \" \n Cohen proposes that explanation in Marxs conception of the social system is functional by which he means roughly that the character of what is explained is determined by its effect on what explains it so that economic relations of production profoundly affect productive forces technology and legal-political superstructures strongly condition economic foundations Thus in the latter case in one direction a societys legal-political superstructure stabilizes or entrenches its economic structure but in the other direction the economic relations determine the character of the superstructure so that in this sense the economic base is primary and the superstructure secondary It is precisely because the superstructure strongly affects the base that the base selects that superstructure As \n Charles Taylor \n puts it \"These two directions of influence are so far from being rivals that they are actually complementary The functional explanation requires that the secondary factor tend to have a causal effect on the primary for this dispositional fact is the key feature of the explanation \" \n It is because the influences in the two directions are not symmetrical that it makes sense to speak of primary and secondary factors even where one is giving a non-reductionist \"holistic\" account of social interaction \n The level of development of societys productive forces i e societys technological powers including tools machinery raw materials and labour power determines societys economic structure in the sense that it selects a structure of economic relations that tends best to facilitate further technological growth In historical explanation the overall primacy of the productive forces can be understood in terms of two key theses \n a The productive forces tend to develop throughout history the Development Thesis \n b The nature of the production relations of a society is explained by the level of development of its productive forces the Primacy Thesis proper \n In saying that productive forces have a universal \n tendency \n to develop Cohens reading of Marx is not claiming that productive forces always develop or that they never decline Their development may be temporarily blocked but because human beings have a rational interest in developing their capacities to control their interactions with external nature in order to satisfy their wants the historical tendency is strongly toward further development of these capacities \n

perspective \n social norms \n are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society \n Social psychology \n recognizes smaller group units such as a team or an office may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations \n In other words norms are regarded as collective representations of acceptable group conduct as well as individual perceptions of particular group conduct \n They can be viewed as cultural products including values customs and traditions \n which represent individuals' basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do \n Furthermore in the field of social psychology the roles of norms are emphasized which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as \"mental representations of appropriate behavior\" \n For example it has been shown that normative messages can promote pro-social behavior including decreasing alcohol use \n and increasing voter turnout \n and sustainability \n According to the psychological definition of social norms' behavioral component norms have two dimensions how much a behaviour is exhibited and how much the group approves of that behavior \n Both of these dimensions can be used in normative messages to alter norms and subsequently alter behaviors for example a message can target the former dimension by describing high levels of voter turnout in order to encourage more turnout At the same time norms also can be changed contingent on the observed behavior of others how much behavior is exhibited In fact in Sherif one confederate was able to affect the development of a group norm related to the autokinetic effect \n clarification needed \n Behavior \n Social control \n Sociology \n Emergence and transmission \n Transfer of norms between groups \n Deviance from social norms \n Operant conditioning \n Focus theory of normative conduct \n Types \n Descriptive versus injunctive \n Prescriptive and proscriptive \n Subjective \n Mathematical representations \n Return potential model \n Game theory \n Further reading \n Behavior \n Norms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society For example Crandall noted that certain groups e g \n cheerleading \n squads dance troupes sports teams sororities have a rate of \n bulimia \n a publicly recognized life-threatening disease that is much higher than society as a whole Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups \n Social control \n Although not considered to be formal laws within society norms still work to promote a great deal of \n social control \n They are statements that regulate conduct The cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances Ranging in variations depending on culture race religion and geographical location it is the foundation of the terms some know acceptable as not to injure others the golden rule and to keep promises that have been pledged \n Without them there would be a world without consensus common ground or restrictions Even though the law and a state's legislation is not intended to control social norms society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other This is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted For example the criminalisation of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives The language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships \n Social norms can be enforced formally e g through sanctions or informally e g through \n body language \n and non-verbal communication cues Because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership groups are said to control \n discretionary stimuli \n groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members' adherence to group norms effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning \n Social psychology \n research has found the more an individual values group-controlled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self the more likely he is to conform \n Social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival since they represent a codification of belief groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about \n Norms in every culture create \n conformity \n that allows for people to become \n socialized \n to the culture in which they live \n As social beings individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things to use certain words to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes and when it is not Thus knowledge about \n cultural \n norms is important for \n impressions \n which is an individual's regulation of their nonverbal behavior One also comes to know through experience what types of people he/she can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around Typically this knowledge is derived through experience i e social norms are learned through \n social interaction \n Wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the \n white collar work force \n Sociology \n For \n Talcott Parsons \n of the \n functionalist \n school norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters On the other hand \n Karl Marx \n believed that norms are used to promote the creation of \n roles \n in society which allows for people of different levels of \n social class \n structure to be able to function properly \n Marx claims that this power dynamic creates \n social order \n Heinrich Popitz \n is convinced that the establishment of social norms that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego solves the problem of \n contingency \n Niklas Luhmann \n In this way ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution social interaction is thus accelerated Important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions \n and social roles \n Emergence and transmission \n Rulemaking is one of the basic impulses humans have for organizing and simplifying actions Everyday there are new rules put into place as well as old rules that are more structured whether it be for a group or an individual Yet not only do humans make rules they strive on finding the rules that come eye to eye about how the world works \n These rules once accepted by an individual or a group after trial and error then become a norm \n Groups may adopt norms through a variety of ways Norms can arise formally where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations Laws or club rules serve as an example of this \n A large number of these norms we follow 'naturally' such as driving on the right side of the road in the US and on the left side in the UK or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket Many formal norms serve to provide safety to the general public \n However social norms are much more likely to develop informally emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior \n Not necessarily laws set in writing informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life \n These informal norms if broken may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions but instead encourage reprimands warnings or \n othering \n incest \n for example is generally thought of as wrong in society but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it \n Transfer of norms between groups \n Individuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group which can get adopted over time \n Without a clear indication of how to act people typically rely on their past history to determine the best course forward what was successful before may serve them well again In a group individuals may all import different histories or \n scripts \n about appropriate behaviors common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action usually with the integration of several members' schemas \n Under the importation paradigm norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly \n whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer \n Groups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behaviour within the group Once firmly established a norm becomes a part of the group's operational structure and hence more difficult to change While possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the group's norms values and perspectives rather than the other way around \n Deviance from social norms \n \"Normal is a bad word\" a graffito in \n Ljubljana \n Slovenia \n Deviance \n is defined as \"nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society \" \n More simply put if group members do not follow a norm they become labeled as a deviant In the sociological literature this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society Yet deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected Except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal Crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar Clifford R Shaw \n What is considered \"normal\" is relative to the location of the \n culture \n in which the \n social interaction \n is taking place In psychology an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the \"institutionalized deviant \" Similar to the sociological definition institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms At first group members may increase pressure on a non-conformist attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations The role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will effect others \n Especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individual's behavior back into line Over time however if a member continues to disobey the group will give up on him as a lost cause while the group may not necessarily revoke his membership they may give him only superficial consideration \n If a worker is late to a meeting for example violating the office norm of punctuality a boss or other co-worker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened If the behavior continues eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual \"is always late \" The group generalizes the individual's disobedience and promptly dismisses it thereby reducing the member's influence and footing in future group disagreements \n Group tolerance for deviation varies across membership not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations Individuals may build up a \"reserve\" of good behavior through \n conformity \n which they can borrow against later These \n idiosyncrasy credits \n provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations \n A teacher for example may more easily forgive a straight-A student for misbehavingwho has past \"good credit\" saved upthan a repeatedly disruptive student While past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits some group members have a higher balance to start with \n Individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group childhood movie stars for example who enroll in college may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen Finally \n leaders \n or individuals in other high-status positions may begin with more credits and be appear to be \"above the rules\" at times \n Even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless however while held to a more lenient standard than the average member leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme \n Deviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm One of those emotions can be widely attributed to guilt This emotion is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation Guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing \n It can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling Used in both instances it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of self-punishment Using the metaphor of \"dirty hands\" \n it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth It is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others Guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further \"honorable\" actions \n Operant conditioning \n The probability of these actions that are committed are coined to \n B F Skinner \n that states that \n operant conditioning \n plays a role in the process of social norm Operant conditioning is the increase that an action will occur again by increasing the reinforced response This process is that of reward and punishment or trial and error Hand in hand with deviance the consequences of ones behavior whether positive or negative will determine the probability of reoccurrence as well as the push towards regulating ones decisions in the future Containing five sub categories this conditioning treatment is an influence in the actions one commits and the feelings one experiences afterwards In the case of social deviance an individual who has gone against a norm will feel the negative connotation that comes with defying the conditioning that was taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement A perfect example is that of a little girl painting on the wall of the house as she seeks her mothers approval of her artistic work When the child witnesses the mother putting her in a \"time out\" she realizes that if she were to paint on the wall again it will lead to punishment therefore causing her to notice her negative reinforcement Which then makes the probability of her painting the wall again decrease immensely He also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in \n Built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us deviance is a frowned upon action \n Focus theory of normative conduct \n Cialdini \n Reno and Kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural situational or personal norms motivate action the researchers suggested the focus of an individuals attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow \n Types \n Descriptive versus injunctive \n Descriptive norms depict what happens while injunctive norms describe what \n should \n happen Cialdini Reno and Kallgren define a descriptive norm as people's perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations it signifies what most people do without assigning judgment The absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot for example transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not \n litter \n An Injunctive norm on the other hand transmits group approval about a particular behavior it dictates how an individual \n should \n behave \n Watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter \n Prescriptive and proscriptive \n Prescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do \n Expressing gratitude or writing a Thank You card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in American culture Proscriptive norms in contrast comprise the other end of the same spectrum they are similarly society's unwritten rules about what one should not do \n These norms can vary between cultures while an acceptable greeting in some European countries kissing a stranger on the cheek constitutes a proscriptive norm in the United States \n Subjective \n Subjective norm is determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want them to perform a behavior Social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform or not to perform a behavior \n Mathematical representations \n Over the last few decades several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view By quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform The return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes Under these theoretical frameworks choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate quantifiable decision \n Return potential model \n Figure The return potential model reproduced from Jackson \n Developed in the 1960s the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms In the regular coordinate plane the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the X-axis label \n a \n in \n Figure \n while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the Y-axis \n b \n in Figure \n The graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm Theoretically one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action For example it may be the case that among first-year graduate students strong social norms around how many daily cups of coffee you drink exist If the return curve in Figure correctly displays the example social norm we can see that if someone drinks cups of coffee a day the group strongly disapproves The group does not approve of member behavior until someone hits four cups of coffee a day the graduate students as represented by the return curve find it excessive to drink more than seven cups however as the approval again dips below zero As exhibited by the coffee example the return potential model displays for each increment of behavior how much group approval one can anticipate \n Point of maximum return \n The point with the greatest y-coordinate is called the point of maximum return as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best \n While \n c \n in Figure is labeling the return curve in general the highlighted point just above it at X=6 represents the point of maximum return Extending our above example the point of maximum return for first-year graduate students would be cups of coffee they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups Any more or any fewer cups would decrease the approval \n Range of tolerable behavior \n Label \n d \n represents the range of tolerable behavior or the amount of action the group finds acceptable \n It encompasses all the positive area under the curve In Figure the range of tolerable behavior extends is as the group approves of all behavior from to and 7-4=3 Carrying over our coffee example again we can see that first-years only approve of having a limited number of cups of coffee between and more than cups or fewer than would fall outside the range of tolerable behavior Norms can have a narrower or wider range of tolerable behavior Typically a narrower range of behavior indicates a behavior with greater consequences to the group \n Intensity \n The intensity of the norm tells how much the group cares about the norm or how much group affect is at stake to be won or lost It is represented in the return potential model by the total amount of area subsumed by the curve regardless of whether the area is positive or negative \n A norm with low intensity would not vary far from the x-axis the amount of approval or disapproval for given behaviors would be closer to zero A high-intensity norm however would have more extreme approval ratings In Figure the intensity of the norm appears high as few behaviors invoke a rating of indifference \n Crystallization \n Finally norm crystallization refers to how much variance exists within the curve translated from the theoretical back to the actual norm it shows how much agreement exists between group members about the approval for a given amount of behavior \n It may be that some members believe the norm more central to group functioning than others A group norm like how many cups of coffee first years should drink would probably have low crystallization since a lot of individuals have varying beliefs about the appropriate amount of caffeine to imbibe in contrast the norm of not plagiarizing another student's work would likely have high crystallization as people uniformly agree on the behavior's unacceptability Showing the overall group norm the return potential model in Figure does not indicate the crystallization However a return potential model that plotted individual data points alongside the cumulative norm could demonstrate the variance and allow us to deduce crystallization \n Game theory \n Game theory \n Another general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the \n repeated game \n of game theory Rational choice a branch of game theory deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents \n A norm gives a person a \n rule of thumb \n for how they should behave However a \n rational \n person only acts according to the rule if it is optimal for them The situation can be described as follows A norm gives an \n expectation \n of how other people act in a given situation macro A person acts optimally given the expectation micro For a norm to be \n stable \n people's actions must reconstitute the expectation without change micro-macro feedback loop A set of such correct stable expectations is known as a \n Nash equilibrium \n Thus a stable norm must constitute a Nash equilibrium \n In the Nash equilibrium no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action \n Social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the Nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches \n From a game-theoretical point of view there are two \n explanations \n for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world One is the difference in games Different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values which may result in a difference in games The other is \n equilibrium selection \n not explicable by the game itself Equilibrium selection is closely related to \n coordination \n For a simple example driving is common throughout the world but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left see \n coordination game \n A framework called comparative \n institutional analysis \n is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social norms \n Psychology

Studies have shown that in children between ages who bully or show aggressive behavior towards others exhibits anti-social behaviors in their early adulthood There are strong statistical relationships that shows this significant association between childhood aggressiveness and anti-social behaviors Analyses saw that 20% of these children who exhibit anti-social behaviors at later ages had court appearances and police contact as a result of their behavior \n Many of the studies regarding the media's influence on anti-social behaviour have been deemed inconclusive There has been a correlation found between the number of TV hours watched and amounts of \n aggressive \n behaviour \n A study was conducted that observed the effects of \n violent \n and non-violent films on \n Belgian \n and American male \n juvenile delinquents \n The results stated that aggression increased in some measures due to the violent films although only in those who were naturally high in aggression \n Violence \n racism \n sexism \n and other anti-social acts are attributed to things such as genetic predisposition and violence in the home \n Some reviews have found strong correlations between aggression and the viewing of violent media \n while others find little evidence to support their case \n The only unanimously accepted truth regarding anti-social behaviour is that parental guidance carries an undoubtedly strong influence providing children with brief negative evaluations of violent characters helps to reduce violent effects in the individual \n Genetics \n A recent genome-wide analysis of antisocial behavior in a large combined sample has shown that a large number of genetic variants of low individual effect play a role in antisocial behavior \n Moreover this study showed that several variants show gender-specific effects on antisocial behavior in males and females \n Intervention and treatment \n An individual's age at intervention is a strong predictor of the effectiveness of a given treatment \n The specific kinds of anti-social behaviours exhibited as well as the magnitude of those behaviours also impact how effective a treatment is for an individual \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n CBT is a highly effective evidence-based therapy in relation to anti-social behaviour \n This type of treatment focuses on changing how individuals think and act in social situations Individuals with particularly aggressive anti-social behaviours tend to have maladaptive social cognitions including \n hostile attribution bias \n which lead to negative behavioural outcomes \n CBT has been found to be more effective for older children and less effective for younger children \n Problem-solving skills training \n PSST is a type of CBT that aims to recognize and correct how an individual thinks and consequently behaves in social environments \n This training provides steps to assist people in obtaining the skill to be able to evaluate potential solutions to problems occurring outside of therapy and learn how to create positive solutions to avoid physical aggression and resolve conflict \n Behavioural parent training \n Behavioural parent training \n BPT or parent management training PMT focuses on changing how parents interact with their children and equips them with ways to recognize and change their child's maladaptive behaviour in a variety of situations BPT assumes that certain types of interactions between parents and children may reinforce a child's antisocial behaviours therefore the aim of BPT is to teach the parent effective skills to better manage and communicate with their child \n BPT has been found to be most effective for younger children under the age of \n Researchers credit the effectiveness of this treatment at younger ages due to the fact that younger children are more reliant on their parents \n BPT is used to treat children with conduct problems but also for children with \n ADHD \n Medication \n In severe cases medication will be administered to control behaviour however it is not a suitable substitute for therapy \n Lithium carbonate \n has been proven to be effective medication for people with anti-social behaviour reducing aggression threatening behaviour bullying fighting and temper outbursts \n In the UK \n Anti-social behaviour order \n ASBO warning in \n London \n An anti-social behaviour order ASBO is a \n civil \n order made against a person who has been shown on the balance of evidence to have engaged in anti-social behaviour The orders introduced in the United Kingdom by Prime Minister \n Tony Blair \n in \n were designed to \n criminalize \n minor incidents that would not have warranted prosecution before \n The Crime and Disorder Act defines anti-social behaviour as acting in a manner that has \"caused or was likely to cause harassment alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same \n household \n \" as the perpetrator There has been debate concerning the vagueness of this definition \n In a survey conducted by \n University College London \n during May the UK was thought by respondents to be Europe's worst country for anti-social behaviour with 76% believing Britain had a \"big or moderate problem\" \n Current legislation governing anti-social behaviour in the UK is the \n Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act \n which received Royal Assent in March and came into enforcement in October This replaces tools such as the ASBO with streamlined tools designed to make it easier to act on anti-social behaviour \n In Australia \n Anti-social behaviour can have a negative effect and impact on \n Australian \n communities and their perception of safety The Western Australia Police force define antisocial behaviour as any behaviour that annoys irritates disturbs or interferes with a persons ability to go about their lawful business \n In Australia many different acts are classed as anti-social behaviour such as misuse of public space disregard for community safety disregard for personal well-being acts directed at people \n graffiti \n protests liquor offences and drunk driving \n It has been found that it is very common for Australian adolescents to engage in different levels of anti-social behaviour A survey was conducted in in \n New South Wales \n Australia of secondary school students in years to about their involvement in anti-social activities percent reported intentionally damaging or destroying someone else's property percent admitted to having received or selling stolen goods and close to percent confessed to attacking someone with the idea of hurting them \n The Australian community are encouraged to report any behaviour of concern and play a vital role assisting police in reducing anti-social behaviour One study conducted in established how perpetrators of anti-social behaviour may not actually intend to cause offense The study examined anti-social behaviours or microaggressions within the LGBTIQ community on a university campus The study established how many members felt that other people would often commit anti-social behaviours however there was no explicit suggestion of any maliciousness behind these acts Rather it was just that the offenders were naive to impact of their behaviour \n The Western Australia Police force uses a three step strategy to deal with antisocial behaviour \n Prevention This action uses community engagement intelligence training and development and the targeting of hotspots attempting to prevent unacceptable behaviour from occurring \n Response A timely and effective response to antisocial behaviour is vital Police provide ownership leadership and coordination to apprehend offenders \n Resolution Identifying the underlying issues that cause anti-social behaviour are determined and resolved with the help of the community and offenders are successfully prosecuted \n Asociality \n

meanings of \n safety \n For example \n home safety \n may indicate a building's ability to protect against external harm events such as weather home invasion etc or may indicate that its internal installations such as appliances stairs etc are safe not dangerous or harmful for its inhabitants \n Discussions of safety often include mention of related terms Security is such a term With time the definitions between these two have often become interchanged equated and frequently appear juxtaposed in the same sentence Readers unfortunately are left to conclude whether they comprise a redundancy This confuses the uniqueness that should be reserved for each by itself When seen as unique as we intend here each term will assume its rightful place in influencing and being influenced by the other \n Safety is the condition of a steady state of an organization or place doing what it is supposed to do What it is supposed to do is defined in terms of public codes and standards associated architectural and engineering designs corporate vision and mission statements and operational plans and personnel policies For any organization place or function large or small safety is a normative concept It complies with situation-specific definitions of what is expected and acceptable \n Using this definition protection from a homes external threats and protection from its internal structural and equipment failures see Meanings above are not two types of safety but rather two aspects of a homes steady state \n In the world of everyday affairs not all goes as planned Some entitys steady state is challenged This is where security science which is of more recent date enters Drawing from the definition of safety then \n Security is the process or means physical or human of delaying preventing and otherwise protecting against external or internal defects dangers loss criminals and other individuals or actions that threaten hinder or destroy an organizations steady state and deprive it of its intended purpose for being \n Using this generic definition of safety it is possible to specify the elements of a security program \n Limitations \n Safety can be limited in relation to some \n guarantee \n or a standard of \n insurance \n to the quality and unharmful function of an object or organization It is used in order to ensure that the object or organization will do only what it is meant to do \n It is important to realize that safety is relative Eliminating all \n risk \n if even possible would be extremely difficult and very expensive A safe situation is one where risks of injury or property damage are low and manageable \n Types \n There is a distinction between products that meet standards that are safe and that merely feel safe The highway safety community uses these terms \n Normative \n Normative safety is achieved when a product or design meets applicable standards and practices for design and construction or manufacture regardless of the product's actual safety history \n Substantive \n Substantive or objective safety occurs when the real-world safety history is favorable whether or not standards are met \n Perceived \n Perceived or subjective safety refers to the users' level of comfort and perception of risk without consideration of standards or safety history For example \n traffic signals \n are perceived as safe yet under some circumstances they can increase \n traffic crashes \n at an intersection Traffic \n roundabouts \n have a generally favorable safety record \n yet often make drivers nervous \n Low perceived safety can have costs For example after the 9/11/2001 attacks many people chose to drive rather than fly despite the fact that even counting terrorist attacks flying is safer than driving Perceived risk discourages people from walking and bicycling for transportation enjoyment or exercise even though the health benefits outweigh the risk of injury \n Security \n Also called social safety or public safety security addresses the risk of harm due to intentional criminal acts such as assault burglary or vandalism \n Because of the moral issues involved security is of higher importance to many people than substantive safety For example a death due to murder is considered worse than a death in a car crash even though in many countries traffic deaths are more common than homicides \n Risks and responses \n Safety is generally interpreted as implying a real and significant impact on risk of death injury or damage to property In response to perceived risks many interventions may be proposed with engineering responses and regulation being two of the most common \n Probably the most common individual response to perceived safety issues is insurance which compensates for or provides restitution in the case of damage or loss \n System safety and reliability engineering \n System safety \n and \n reliability engineering \n is an engineering discipline Continuous changes in technology environmental regulation and public safety concerns make the analysis of complex \n safety-critical \n systems more and more demanding \n A common fallacy for example among electrical engineers regarding structure power systems is that safety issues can be readily deduced In fact safety issues have been discovered one by one over more than a century in the case mentioned in the work of many thousands of practitioners and cannot be deduced by a single individual over a few decades A knowledge of the literature the standards and custom in a field is a critical part of safety engineering A combination of theory and track record of practices is involved and track record indicates some of the areas of theory that are relevant In the USA persons with a state license in Professional Engineering in Electrical Engineering are expected to be competent in this regard the foregoing notwithstanding but most electrical engineers have no need of the license for their work \n Safety is often seen as one of a group of related disciplines quality reliability availability maintainability and safety Availability is sometimes not mentioned on the principle that it is a simple function of reliability and maintainability These issues tend to determine the value of any work and deficits in any of these areas are considered to result in a cost beyond the cost of addressing the area in the first place good management is then expected to minimize total cost \n Measures \n Safety measures \n are activities and precautions taken to improve safety i e reduce risk related to human health Common safety measures include \n Chemical analysis \n Destructive testing \n of samples \n Drug testing \n of employees etc \n Examination of activities by specialists \n to minimize physical stress or increase productivity \n Geological surveys \n to determine whether land or water sources are polluted how firm the ground is at a potential building site etc \n Government regulation \n so suppliers know what standards their product is expected to meet \n Industry regulation \n so suppliers know what level of quality is expected Industry regulation is often imposed to avoid potential government regulation \n Instruction manuals \n explaining how to use a product or perform an activity \n Instructional videos \n demonstrating proper use of products \n Root cause analysis \n to identify causes of a system failure and correct deficiencies \n Internet safety \n or Online Safety is protection of the \n user \n 's safety from cyber threats or \n computer crime \n in general \n Periodic evaluations \n of employees departments etc \n Physical examinations \n to determine whether a person has a physical condition that would create a problem \n Process safety management \n is an analytical tool focused on preventing releases of highly hazardous chemicals \n Safety margins/Safety factors \n For instance a product rated to never be required to handle more than pounds might be designed to fail under at least pounds a safety factor of two Higher numbers are used in more sensitive applications such as medical or transit safety \n Self-imposed regulation \n of various types \n Implementation of \n standard protocols and procedures \n so that activities are conducted in a known way \n Statements of ethics \n by industry organizations or an individual company so its employees know what is expected of them \n Stress testing \n subjects a person or product to stresses in excess of those the person or product is designed to handle to determining the \"breaking point\" \n Training \n of employees vendors product users \n Visual examination for dangerous situations \n such as emergency exits blocked because they are being used as storage areas \n Visual examination for flaws \n such as cracks peeling loose connections \n X-ray analysis \n to see inside a sealed object such as a weld a cement wall or an airplane outer skin \n Standards organizations \n A number of \n standards organizations \n exist that promulgate safety standards These may be voluntary organizations or government agencies These agencies first define the safety standards which they publish in the form of codes They are also Accreditation Bodies and entitle independent \n third parties \n such as testing and certification agencies to inspect and ensure compliance to the standards they defined For instance the \n American Society of Mechanical Engineers \n ASME formulated a certain number of safety standards in its \n Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code \n BPVC and accredited TV Rheinland to provide certification services to guarantee product compliance to the defined safety regulations \n United States \n American National Standards Institute \n A major American \n standards organization \n is the \n American National Standards Institute \n ANSI Usually members of a particular industry will voluntarily form a committee to study safety issues and propose standards Those standards are then recommended to ANSI which reviews and adopts them Many government regulations require that products sold or used must comply with a particular ANSI standard \n Government agencies \n Many government agencies set safety standards for matters under their jurisdiction such as \n the \n Food and Drug Administration \n the \n Consumer Product Safety Commission \n the \n United States Environmental Protection Agency \n Testing laboratories \n Product safety testing for the United States is largely controlled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission In addition workplace related products come under the jurisdiction of the \n Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n OSHA which certifies independent testing companies as Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories NRTL see \n European Union \n Institutions \n the \n European Commission EC \n the \n European Committee for Standardization CEN \n the \n European Food Safety Authority EFSA \n the European Safety Federation ESF \n Testing laboratories \n The European Commission provides the legal framework but the different Member States may authorize test

Although civil disobedience is considered to be an expression of contempt for \n law \n Martin Luther King Jr \n regarded civil disobedience to be a display and practice of reverence for law for as \"Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail in order to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at

\n Choice of specific act \n Cooperation with authorities \n Choice of plea \n Choice of allocution \n Legal implications of civil disobedience \n Further reading \n Overview \n Its earliest massive non-violent implementation was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in \n the Revolution \n Zaghloul Pasha \n considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience was a native middle-class \n Azhar \n graduate political activist judge parliamentary and ex-Cabinet Minister whose leadership brought Christian and Muslim communities together as well as women into the massive protests Along with his companions of \n Wafd Party \n who started campaigning in they have achieved independence of Egypt and a first constitution in \n Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws It has been used in many \n nonviolent resistance \n movements in \n India \n Gandhi's \n campaigns for \n independence \n from the \n British Empire \n in \n Czechoslovakia \n 's \n Velvet Revolution \n in early stages of Bangladesh independence movement against Pakistani repression and in \n East Germany \n to oust their \n communist \n governments \n In \n South Africa \n in the fight against \n apartheid \n in the \n American Civil Rights Movement \n in the \n Singing Revolution \n to bring independence to the \n Baltic countries \n from the \n Soviet Union \n recently with the \n Rose Revolution \n in Georgia and the \n Orange Revolution \n in Ukraine among other various movements worldwide \n One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in \n Sophocles \n ' play \n Antigone \n in which \n Antigone \n one of the daughters of former King of \n Thebes \n Oedipus \n defies \n Creon \n the current King of Thebes who is trying to stop her from giving her brother \n Polynices \n a proper burial She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with and eventually carries out but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this \n Following the \n Peterloo massacre \n of poet \n Percy Shelley \n wrote the political poem \n The Mask of Anarchy \n later that year that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his timeand then imagines the stirrings of a new form of \n social action \n According to \n Ashton Nichols \n it is perhaps the first \n modern \n statement of the principle of nonviolent protest \n A version was taken up by the author \n Henry David Thoreau \n in his essay \n Civil Disobedience \n and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of \n Satyagraha \n Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action \n In particular it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's \n Masque of Anarchy \n to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India \n Thoreau's essay \n Civil Disobedience \n originally titled \"Resistance to Civil Government\" has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors even when such support is required by law In the essay Thoreau explained his reasons for having \n refused to pay taxes \n as an act of \n protest \n against \n slavery \n and against the \n MexicanAmerican War \n He writes \n If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations I must first see at least that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders I must get off him first that he may pursue his contemplations too See what gross inconsistency is tolerated I have heard some of my townsmen say \"I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves or to march to Mexico see if I would go \" and yet these very men have each directly by their allegiance and so indirectly at least by their money furnished a substitute \n By the 1850s a range of minority groups in the \n United States \n Blacks Jews Seventh Day Baptists Catholics anti-prohibitionists racial egalitarians and othersemployed civil disobedience to combat a range of legal measures and public practices that to them promoted ethnic religious and \n racial discrimination \n Public and typically peaceful resistance to political power would remain an integral tactic in modern American \n minority rights \n politics \n Etymology \n Henry David Thoreau \n 's classic essay \n Civil Disobedience \n inspired \n Martin Luther King \n and many other \n activists \n Henry David Thoreau \n 's essay \"Resistance to Civil Government\" was eventually renamed \"Essay on Civil Disobedience \" After his landmark lectures were published in the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico \n Thus by the time Thoreau's lectures were first published under the title \"Civil Disobedience \" in four years after his death the term had achieved fairly widespread usage \n It has been argued that the term \"civil disobedience\" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times become utterly debased Marshall Cohen notes \"It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to \n taking aim at a federal official \n Indeed for \n Vice President \n Agnew \n it has become a code-word describing the activities of \n muggers \n arsonists \n draft evaders \n campaign hecklers \n campus militants \n anti-war demonstrators \n juvenile delinquents \n and \n political assassins \n \" \n LeGrande writes that \"the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult if not impossible In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of \n semantical \n problems and grammatical niceties Like \n Alice in Wonderland \n he often finds that specific terminology has no more or no less meaning than the individual orator intends it to have \" He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration nonviolent civil disobedience and violent civil disobedience \n In a letter to P K Rao dated September Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of \n Thoreau \n The statement that I had derived my idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay When I saw the title of Thoreau's great essay I began to use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers But I found that even \"Civil Disobedience\" failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle I therefore adopted the phrase \"Civil Resistance \" \n Theories \n In seeking an active form of civil disobedience one may choose to deliberately break certain laws such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally \n though sometimes violence has been known to occur Often there is an expectation to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack \n Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws as distinguished from a \n constitutional impasse \n in which two public agencies especially two equally \n sovereign \n branches of government \n conflict For instance if the \n head of government \n of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court it would not be civil disobedience since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen \n However this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs the collective The individual is the final judge of right and wrong More than this since only individuals act only individuals can act unjustly When the government knocks on the door it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood Before Thoreaus imprisonment when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay Thoreau had advised \"Resign \" If a man chose to be an agent of injustice then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice But if government is \"the voice of the people \" as it is often called shouldnt that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians Even a good form of government is \"liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it \" Moreover even if a government did express the voice of the people this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right What then is the proper relationship between the individual and the government? \n Ronald Dworkin \n held that there are three types of civil disobedience \n \"Integrity-based\" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys a law she or he feels is immoral as in the case of abolitionists disobeying the \n fugitive slave laws \n by refusing to turn over escaped slaves to authorities \n \"Justice-based\" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys laws in order to lay claim to some right denied to her or him as when blacks illegally protested during the \n Civil Rights Movement \n \"Policy-based\" civil disobedience occurs when a person breaks the law in order to change a policy s he believes is dangerously wrong \n Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as \n trade unions \n banks \n and \n private universities \n can be justified if it reflects \"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\" The same principle she argues applies to breaches of law in protest against \n international organizations \n and foreign governments \n It is usually recognized that lawbreaking if it is not done publicly at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his \n natural rights \n he might for instance find that assisting in \n fabricating evidence \n or committing \n perjury \n is more effective than open disobedience This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on \n deceit \n in such situations \n The \n Fully Informed Jury Association \n 's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when \n Hitler \n 's \n secret police \n demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house \" \n By this definition civil disobedience could be traced back to the \n Book of Exodus \n where \n Shiphrah \n and \n Puah \n refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it Exodus 15-19 \n Violent vs non-violent \n There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent \n Black's Law Dictionary \n includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means \" but holds that they do not have to be non-violent \n It has been argued that while both civil disobedience and \n civil rebellion \n are justified by appeal to \n constitutional defects \n rebellion is much more destructive therefore the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience and if one cannot justify civil rebellion then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience \n Philosopher H J McCloskey argues that \"if violent intimidatory coercive disobedience is more effective it is other things being equal more justified than less effective nonviolent disobedience \" \n In his best-selling \n Disobedience and Democracy Nine Fallacies on Law and Order \n Howard Zinn \n takes a similar position Zinn states that while the goals of civil disobedience are generally non-violent \n in the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a non-violent one the choice of means will almost never be pure and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and non-violence does not suffice as a guide the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change \n Zinn rejects any \"easy and righteous dismissal of violence \" noting that \n Henry Thoreau \n the popularizer of the term civil disobedience approved of the armed insurrection of \n John Brown \n He also notes that some major civil disobedience campaigns which have been classified as non-violent such as the \n Birmingham campaign \n have actually included elements of violence \n Revolutionary vs non-revolutionary \n Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged \"wrong\" by an individual conscience or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective to cause their repeal or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government or to change cultural traditions social customs religious beliefs etc revolution doesn't have to be political i e \"cultural revolution\" it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric \n Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience \n It has been claimed that the \n Hungarians \n under \n Ferenc Dek \n directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the \n Austrian government \n Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing \"peaceable revolution \" \n Howard Zinn \n Harvey Wheeler \n and others have identified the right espoused in \n The Declaration of Independence \n to \"alter or abolish\" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience \n Collective vs solitary \n The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the \n Roman Empire \n citation needed \n Unarmed \n Jews \n gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the \n Temple in Jerusalem \n citation needed \n original research? \n In modern times some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign \n bail \n until certain demands are met such as favorable bail conditions or the release of all the activists This is a form of \n jail solidarity \n pageneeded \n There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience such as that committed by Thoreau but these sometimes go unnoticed Thoreau at the time of his arrest was not yet a well-known author and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days weeks and months after it happened The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War \n Techniques \n Examples of civil disobedience \n Choice of specific act \n Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts Bedau writes \"There is a whole class of acts undertaken in the name of civil disobedience which even if they were widely practiced would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance e g trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation Such acts are often just a harassment and at least to the bystander somewhat inane The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity \" Bedau also notes though that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward \n public policy \n goals may serve a propaganda purpose \n Some civil disobedients such as the proprietors of illegal \n medical cannabis dispensaries \n and Voice in the Wilderness which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U S Government directly achieve a desired social goal such as the provision of medication to the sick while openly breaking the law \n Julia Butterfly Hill \n lived in \n Luna \n a 180-foot 55m -tall 600-year-old \n California Redwood \n tree for days successfully preventing it from being cut down \n In cases where the criminalized behavior is \n pure speech \n civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech An example would be \n WBAI \n 's broadcasting the track \" \n Filthy Words \n \" from a \n George Carlin \n comedy album which eventually led to the Supreme Court case of \n FCC v Pacifica Foundation \n Threatening government officials \n is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies For example Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the \n Lebanon New Hampshire \n city councilors stating \"Wise up or die \" \n More generally protesters of particular \n victimless crimes \n often see fit to openly commit that crime Laws against \n public nudity \n for instance have been \n protested \n by going naked in public and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at \n cannabis rallies \n Some forms of civil disobedience such as \n illegal boycotts \n refusals to pay taxes \n draft dodging \n distributed denial-of-service attacks \n and \n sit-ins \n make it more difficult for a system to function In this way they might be considered coercive Brownlee notes that \"although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table \" \n The \n Plowshares \n organization temporarily closed \n GCSB Waihopai \n by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes \n Electronic civil disobedience \n can include \n web site defacements \n redirects \n denial-of-service attacks \n information theft \n and \n data leaks \n illegal web site \n parodies \n virtual sit-ins \n and \n virtual sabotage \n It is distinct from other kinds of \n hacktivism \n in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets but they often generate significant media attention \n Dilemma actions \n are designed to create a \"response dilemma\" for public authorities \"by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest \" \n Cooperation with authorities \n A police officer speaks with a demonstrator at a union picket explaining that she will be arrested if she does not leave the street The demonstrator was arrested moments later \n Some disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protestor must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities Others advocate falling limp or \n resisting arrest \n especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest \n Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases For example the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a \n consent search \n of his property and whether or not to talk to police officers It is generally agreed within the legal community \n and is often believed within the activist community that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose and may be harmful However some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications or due to a fear of seeming rude \n Also some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers Thoreau wrote \"My civil neighbor the tax-gatherer is the very man I have to deal with--for it is after all with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government or as a man until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me his neighbor for whom he has respect as a neighbor and well-disposed man or as a maniac and disturber of the peace and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action \" \n Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the \n social contract \n which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established or else suffer the penalties set out in the law Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still don't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government or don't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted And still other civil disobedients being anarchists don't believe in the legitimacy of any government and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others \n Choice of plea \n An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to \n plead guilty \n There is much debate on this point as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law \n It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience \n ACT-UP \n 's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating \"Yes I committed the act of which you accuse me I don't deny it in fact I am proud of it I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law I am guilty as charged \" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of \"Guilt implies wrong-doing I feel I have done no wrong I may have violated some specific laws but I am guilty of doing no wrong I therefore plead not guilty \" A plea of \n no contest \n is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two \n One defendant accused of illegally protesting \n nuclear power \n when asked to enter his plea stated \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\" \n this is known as a \"creative plea \" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty \n When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas Nevada of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest At a pre-arranged announced time one at a time they stepped across the \"line\" and were immediately arrested They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah Nevada and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace that afternoon A well known civil rights attorney Francis Heisler had volunteered to defend the arrested persons advising them to plead \" \n nolo contendere \n \" as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty The arrested persons were found \"guilty \" nevertheless and given suspended sentences conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds \n citation needed \n Howard Zinn writes \"There may be many times when protesters \n choose \n to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice But that is different than the notion that they \n must \n go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way whether it is done by remaining in jail or by evading it To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience to demean the seriousness of the protest In particular the \n neo-conservative \n insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated \" \n Sometimes the prosecution proposes a \n plea bargain \n to civil disobedients as in the case of the \n Camden \n in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time \n In some \n mass arrest \n situations the activists decide to use \n solidarity \n tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone \n But some activists have opted to enter a \n blind plea \n pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place Mohandas Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court \"I am here to submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen \" \n Choice of allocution \n Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech or a speech explaining their actions in \n allocution \n In \n U S v Burgos-Andujar \n a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U S Navy property argued to the court in allocution that \"the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy\" As a result the judge increased her sentence from to days This action was upheld because according to the \n U S Court of Appeals for the First Circuit \n her statement suggested a lack of remorse an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions \n Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials \n Tim DeChristopher \n gave an allocution statement to the court describing the U S as \"a place where the rule of law was created through acts of civil disobedience\" and arguing \"Since those bedrock acts of civil disobedience by our founding fathers the rule of law in this country has continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice \" \n Legal implications of civil disobedience \n Steven Barkan \n writes that if defendants plead not guilty \"they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience \" A \n technical defense \n may enhance the chances for acquittal but increase the possibility of additional proceedings as well as reduced press coverage During the \n Vietnam War \n era the \n Chicago Eight \n used a \n political defense \n while \n Benjamin Spock \n used a technical defense \n In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a \n jury trial \n but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes some civil disobedients seek \n jury nullification \n Over the years this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as \n Sparf v United States \n which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative and \n United States v Dougherty \n which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification \n Governments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law Specifically the law usually distinguishes between \n criminal motive \n and \n criminal intent \n the offender's motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy but his intent may still be criminal \n Hence the saying that \"if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience it must come from outside the legal system \" \n One theory is that while disobedience may be helpful any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit Therefore conscientious lawbreakers must be punished \n Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a \n test case \n as to the \n constitutionality \n of a law and then wins his case then that act did not constitute civil disobedience \n It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification as in the case of a \n homosexual \n or \n cannabis \n user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law is not civil disobedience \n Likewise a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution or by denying having committed the crime or by fleeing the jurisdiction is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient \n Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not itself the object of protest whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law \" \n During the \n Vietnam War \n courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the \n legality of the Vietnam War \n the courts ruled it was a \n political question \n The \n necessity defense \n has sometimes been used as a \n shadow defense \n by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom \n However court cases such as \n U S v Schoon \n have greatly curtailed the availability of the \n political necessity defense \n Likewise when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the \n Clamshell Alliance \n 's illegal occupation of the \n Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant \n the judge instructed the jury to disregard his \n competing harms \n defense and he was found guilty \n Fully Informed Jury Association \n activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to according to FIJA many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned correctly that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence \" \n Along with giving the offender his \n \"just deserts\" \n achieving \n crime control \n via \n incapacitation \n and \n deterrence \n is a major goal of \n criminal punishment \n Brownlee argues \"Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the laws engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law \" \n Leonard Hubert Hoffmann \n writes \"In deciding whether or not to impose punishment the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good This means that the objector has no right not to be punished It is a matter for the state including the judges to decide on \n utilitarian \n grounds whether to do so or not \" \n Lord Hoffman also asserted that while the \"rules of the game\" for protesters were to remain non-violent while breaking the law the authorities must recognise that demonstrators are acting out of their conscience in pursuit of democracy \"When it comes to punishment the court should take into account their personal convictions \" he said \n Environmental activists who believe they are acting as \"conscientious protectors\" are able to become legal Earth Protectors \n through a ratified Trust Fund document This document can be submitted in defense of acts of civil disobedience under article of the Human Rights declaration as well as a point of mitigation for honest character \n Wikiquote has quotations related to \n Civil disobedience \n Wikimedia Commons has

personality psychology \n Right-wing authoritarians are people who have a high degree of willingness to submit to authorities they perceive as established and legitimate who adhere to societal conventions and norms and who are hostile and punitive in their attitudes towards people who do not adhere to them They value uniformity and are in favour of using group authority including coercion to achieve it \n Assessment \n Attitudes \n Right and left \n Research \n Relationship to personality traits \n Criticism and development \n Further reading \n The concept of right-wing authoritarianism was introduced in by Canadian-American psychologist \n Bob Altemeyer \n as a refinement of the \n authoritarian personality \n theory originally pioneered by \n University of California Berkeley \n researchers \n Theodor W Adorno \n Else Frenkel-Brunswik \n Daniel Levinson \n and \n Nevitt Sanford \n After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis Altemeyer found that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together authoritarian submission authoritarian aggression and conventionalism Researchers have traditionally assumed that there was just one kind of authoritarian personality who could be either a follower or a leader The discovery that followers and leaders are usually different types of authoritarians is based on research done by Sam McFarland \n Assessment \n Right-wing authoritarianism is measured by the RWA scale which uses a \n Likert scale \n response The first scored item on the scale states \"Our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\" People who strongly agree with this are showing a tendency toward authoritarian submission \"Our country desperately needs a mighty leader\" authoritarian aggression \"who will do what has to be done to destroy\" and conventionalism \"the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\" \n Psychometrically \n the RWA scale was a significant improvement over the \n F-scale \n which was the original measure of the authoritarian personality The F-scale was worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response thus leaving it susceptible to the \n acquiescence response bias \n The RWA scale is balanced to have an equal number of pro and anti authoritarian statements The RWA scale also has excellent internal reliability with \n coefficient alpha \n typically measuring between and \n The RWA scale has been modified over the years as many of the items lost their social significance as society changed and the current version is items long \n Although Altemeyer has continually updated the scale researchers in different domains have tended to lock-in on particular versions For example in the social psychology of religion the version of the scale is still commonly used \n In addition the length of the earlier versions items led many researchers to develop shorter versions of the scale Some of those are published \n but many researchers simply select a subset of items to use in their research a practice that Altemeyer strongly criticizes \n The uni-dimensionality of the scale has also been challenged recently For example Funke \n showed that it is possible to extract the three underlying dimensions of RWA if the double- and triple-barreled nature of the items is removed Given the possibility of underlying dimensions emerging from the scale it is then the case that the scale is no longer balanced since all the items primarily capturing authoritarian aggression are pro-trait worded higher scores mean more authoritarianism and all the items primarily measuring conventionalism are con-trait worded higher scores mean less authoritarianism \n Work by Mavor Louis and Sibley \n recently demonstrated that the existence of or factors in the RWA scale reflects real differences in these dimensions rather than acquiescence response bias \n citation needed \n Attitudes \n Right-wing authoritarians want society and social interactions structured in ways that increase uniformity and minimize diversity In order to achieve that they tend to be in favour of social control coercion and the use of group authority to place constraints on the behaviours of people such as political dissidents and ethnic minorities These constraints might include restrictions on immigration limits on free speech and association and laws regulating moral behaviour It is the willingness to support or take action that leads to increased social uniformity that makes right-wing authoritarianism more than just a personal distaste for difference Right-wing authoritarianism is characterized by obedience to authority moral absolutism racial and ethnic prejudice and intolerance and punitiveness towards dissidents and deviants In parenting right-wing authoritarians value children's obedience neatness and good manners \n Right-wing authoritarianism is defined by three \n attitudinal \n and \n behavioral \n clusters which \n correlate \n together \n Authoritarian submission a high degree of submissiveness to the authorities who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives \n Authoritarian aggression a general aggressiveness directed against deviants outgroups and other people that are perceived to be targets according to established authorities \n Conventionalism a high degree of adherence to the traditions and social norms that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities and a belief that others in one's society should also be required to adhere to these norms \n The terminology of \"authoritarianism\" \"right-wing authoritarianism\" and \"authoritarian personality\" tend to be used interchangeably by psychologists though inclusion of the term \"personality\" may indicate a psychodynamic interpretation consistent with the original formulation of the theory \n citation needed \n Right and left \n The phrase \"right-wing\" in right-wing authoritarianism does not necessarily refer to someone's politics but to psychological preferences and personality It means that the person tends to follow the established conventions and authorities in society In theory the authorities could have either \n right-wing \n or \n left-wing \n political views \n Milton Rokeach \n 's dogmatism scale was an early attempt to measure pure authoritarianism whether left or right The scale was carefully designed to measure \n closed-mindedness \n without regard to ideology Nevertheless researchers found that it correlated with \n British political conservativism \n In a similar line of research Philip Tetlock found that right wing beliefs are associated with less \n integrative complexity \n than left wing beliefs People with moderate liberal attitudes had the highest integrative complexity in their cognitions \n There have been a number of other attempts to identify \"left-wing authoritarians\" in the United States and Canada These would be people who submit to leftist authorities are highly conventional to liberal viewpoints and are aggressive to people who oppose left-wing ideology These attempts have failed because measures of authoritarianism always correlate at least slightly with the right However left-wing authoritarians were found in Eastern Europe \n There are certainly extremists across the political spectrum but most psychologists now believe that authoritarianism is a predominantly right-wing phenomenon \n Although authoritarians in North America generally support conservative political parties this finding must be considered in a historical and cultural context For example during the \n Cold War \n authoritarians in the United States were usually anti-communist whereas in the Soviet Union authoritarians generally supported the Communist Party and were opposed to capitalism \n Authoritarians thus generally favor the established ways and oppose social and political change hence even politics usually labeled as right or left-wing is not descriptive While communism in the Soviet Union is seen as leftist it still inspired the same responses Furthermore recent research indicates that political progressives can exhibit the qualities of authoritarianism when they are asked about conservative Christians \n This leaves questions over what makes various ideologies left or right open to interpretation \n citation needed \n A study found evidence that was suggestive of the existence of left-wing authoritarians \n According to \n Karen Stenner \n an Australian professor who specializes in authoritarianism racism and intolerance authoritarianism is different from conservatism because authoritarianism reflects aversion to difference across space i e diversity of people and beliefs at any given moment while conservatism reflects aversion to difference over time i e change Stenner argues that conservatives will embrace racial diversity civil liberties and moral freedom to the extent they are already institutionalized authoritatively-supported traditions and are therefore supportive of social stability Conservatives tend to be drawn to authoritarianism when public opinion is fractious and there is a loss of confidence in public institutions but in general they value stability and certainty over increased uniformity However Stenner says that authoritarians also want difference restricted even when so doing would require significant social change and instability \n Research \n According to research by Altemeyer right-wing authoritarians tend to exhibit cognitive errors and symptoms of faulty reasoning Specifically they are more likely to make incorrect inferences from evidence and to hold \n contradictory ideas \n that result from compartmentalized thinking They are also more likely to uncritically accept insufficient evidence that supports their beliefs and they are less likely to acknowledge their own limitations \n Whether right-wing authoritarians are less intelligent than average is disputed with Stenner arguing that variables such as high verbal ability indicative of high cognitive capacity have a very substantial ameliorative effect in diminishing authoritarian tendencies \n Measured against other factors of personality authoritarians generally score lower on \n openness to experience \n and slightly higher on \n conscientiousness \n Altemeyer suggested that authoritarian politicians are more likely to be in the Conservative or Reform party in Canada or the Republican Party in the United States They generally have a conservative economic philosophy are highly nationalistic oppose abortion support capital punishment oppose gun control legislation and do not value social equality \n The RWA scale reliably correlates with political party affiliation reactions to Watergate pro-capitalist attitudes religious orthodoxy and acceptance of covert governmental activities such as illegal wiretaps \n Although authoritarianism is correlated with conservative political ideology not all authoritarians are conservative and not all conservatives are authoritarian It is also worth noting that many authoritarians have no interest in politics \n citation needed \n Authoritarians are generally more favorable to punishment and control than personal freedom and diversity For example they are more willing to suspend constitutional guarantees of liberty such as the \n Bill of Rights \n They are more likely to advocate strict punitive sentences for criminals \n and report that punishing such people is satisfying for them They tend to be \n ethnocentric \n and prejudiced against racial and ethnic minorities \n and homosexuals \n However Stenner argues that authoritarians will support programs intended to increase opportunities for minority groups such as affirmative action if they believe such programs will lead to greater societal uniformity \n In roleplaying situations authoritarians tend to seek dominance over others by being competitive and destructive instead of cooperative In a study by Altemeyer authoritarians played a three-hour simulation of the Earth's future entitled the \n Global Change Game \n Unlike a comparison game played by individuals with low RWA scores which resulted in \n world peace \n and widespread international cooperation the simulation by authoritarians became highly militarized and eventually entered the stage of \n nuclear war \n By the end of the high RWA game the entire population of the earth was declared dead \n The vast majority of research on right-wing authoritarianism has been done in the United States and Canada However a cross-cultural study examined the relation between authoritarianism and individualism-collectivism in samples from Bulgaria Canada Germany Japan New Zealand Poland and the United States Both at the individual level and the societal level authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism or dominance seeking and vertical or hierarchical collectivism which is the tendency to submit to the demands of one's ingroup \n A study done on both Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters and scores of secular subjects were lowest \n Right-wing authoritarianism has been found to correlate only slightly with \n Social Dominance Orientation \n SDO The two measures can be thought of as two sides of the same coin RWA provides submissive followers and SDO provides power-seeking leaders \n Relationship to personality traits \n Research comparing RWA with the \n Big Five personality traits \n has found that RWA is positively correlated with \n conscientiousness \n r = and negatively correlated with \n openness to experience \n r = SDO has a somewhat different pattern of correlations with the Big Five as it is also associated with low openness to experience r = but is not significantly correlated with conscientiousness r = and instead has a negative correlation with \n agreeableness \n r = Low openness to experience and high conscientiousness have been found to be predictive of social conformity People low in openness to experience tend to prefer clear unambiguous moral rules and are more likely to support the existing social order insofar as it provides clear guidance about social norms for behavior and how the world should be People low in openness to experience are also more sensitive to threats both real and symbolic to the social order and hence tend to view outgroups who deviate from traditional social norms and values as a threat to ingroup norms and values Conscientiousness is associated with a preference for order structure and security hence this might explain the connection with RWA \n Criticism and development \n A recent refinement to this body of research was presented in \n Karen Stenner \n 's book \n The Authoritarian Dynamic \n Stenner argues that RWA is best understood as expressing a dynamic response to external threat not a static disposition based only on the traits of submission aggression and conventionalism Stenner is critical of Altemeyer's social learning interpretation and argues that it cannot account for how levels of authoritarianism fluctuate with social conditions She argues that the RWA Scale can be viewed as a measure of expressed authoritarianism but that other measures are needed to assess authoritarian predispositions which interact with threatening circumstances to produce the authoritarian response \n Recent criticism has also come as a result of treating RWA as uni-dimensional even in contexts where it makes no sense to do so For example RWA has been used in regression analyses with fundamentalism as another predictor and attitudes to homosexuality and racism as the outcomes \n For example this research seemed to show that fundamentalism would be associated with reduced racism once the authoritarian component was removed and this was summarized in a recent review of the field \n However since the RWA Scale has items that also measure fundamentalist religiosity and attitudes to homosexuality this undermines the interpretation of such analyses \n Even worse is the possibility that the unrecognised dimensionality in RWA can cause a statistical artifact to arise in such regressions which can reduce or even reverse some of the relationships Mavor and colleagues have argued that this artifact eliminates or even reverses any apparent tendency for fundamentalism to reduce racism once RWA is controlled The implication is that in some domains such as the social psychology of religion it is not only preferable to think of RWA as consisting of at least two components but essential in order to avoid statistical errors and incorrect conclusions \n Several options currently exist for scales that acknowledge at least the two main underlying components in the scale aggression/submission and conventionalism \n Altemeyer's research on authoritarianism has been challenged by psychologist John J Ray who questions the sampling methods used and the ability of the RWA Scale to predict authoritarian behavior and provides evidence that the RWA Scale measures conservatism rather than \"directiveness\" a construct that John J Ray invented and that he relates to authoritarianism \n However Ray's approach is a minority position among researchers \n and other psychologists have found that both the RWA Scale and the original F-Scale are good predictors of both attitudes and behavior \n In the American \n Journal of Political Science \n published an article discussing the correlation between conservatism and \n psychoticism \n which they associated with authoritarianism among other traits In they released an erratum \n showing that psychoticism is actually more associated with liberalism whereas \n neuroticism \n is more associated with conservatism

wealth \n and \n social status \n or derived \n power \n social and political As such stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group category geographic region or \n social unit \n In modern \n Western societies \n social stratification typically is distinguished as three \n social classes \n i the \n upper class \n ii the \n middle class \n and iii the \n lower class \n in turn each class can be subdivided into strata e g the upper-stratum the middle-stratum and the lower stratum \n Moreover a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of \n kinship \n clan \n tribe \n or \n caste \n or all four \n The categorization of people by social strata occurs in all societies ranging from the complex \n state-based \n or \n polycentric \n societies to \n tribal \n and \n feudal \n societies which are based upon socio-economic relations among classes of \n nobility \n and classes of \n peasants \n Historically whether or not \n hunter-gatherer \n societies can be defined as socially stratified or if social stratification began with \n agriculture \n and common acts of \n social exchange \n remains a debated matter in the \n social sciences \n Determining the structures of social stratification arises from inequalities of status among persons therefore the degree of \n social inequality \n determines a person's social stratum Generally the greater the \n social complexity \n of a society the more social strata exist by way of \n social differentiation \n Overview \n Definition and usage \n Four underlying principles \n Complexity \n

describe the relative social position of persons in a given \n social group \n category \n geographical region or other \n social unit \n It derives from the \n Latin \n strtum \n plural \n strata \n parallel horizontal layers referring to a given societys categorization of its people into rankings of \n socioeconomic \n tiers based on factors like \n wealth \n income \n social status \n occupation \n and \n power \n In modern \n Western societies \n stratification is often broadly classified into three major divisions of \n social class \n upper class \n middle class \n and \n lower class \n Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes e g \"upper middle\" \n Social strata may also be delineated on the basis of \n kinship ties \n or \n caste \n relations \n The concept of social stratification is often used and interpreted differently within specific theories In \n sociology \n for example proponents of \n action theory \n have suggested that social stratification is commonly found in \n developed \n societies wherein a \n dominance hierarchy \n may be necessary in order to maintain \n social order \n and provide a stable \n social structure \n So-called \n conflict theories \n such as \n Marxism \n point to the inaccessibility of resources and lack of \n social mobility \n found in stratified societies Many sociological theorists have criticized the extent to which the \n working classes \n are unlikely to advance socioeconomically while the \n wealthy \n tend to hold political power which they use to \n exploit \n the \n proletariat \n laboring class \n Talcott Parsons \n an American sociologist asserted that stability and social order are regulated in part by \n universal values \n Such values are not identical with \"consensus\" but can as well be an impetus for ardent social conflict as it has been multiple times through history Parsons never claimed that universal values in and by themselves \"satisfied\" the \n functional prerequisites \n of a society Indeed the constitution of society is a much more complicated codification of emerging historical factors Theorists such as \n Ralf Dahrendorf \n alternately note the tendency toward an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies due to the necessity of an educated workforce in technological economies Various social and political perspectives concerning \n globalization \n such as \n dependency theory \n suggest that these effects are due to change in the status of workers to the \n third world \n Four underlying principles \n Four principles are posited to underlie social stratification First social stratification is socially defined as a property of a society rather than individuals in that society Second social stratification is reproduced from generation to generation Third social stratification is universal found in every society but variable differs across time and place Fourth social stratification involves not just quantitative \n inequality \n but qualitative beliefs and attitudes about social status \n Complexity \n Although stratification is not limited to complex societies all complex societies exhibit features of stratification In any complex society the total stock of valued goods is distributed unequally wherein the most \n privileged \n individuals and families enjoy a disproportionate share of \n income \n power \n and other \n valued \n resources The term \"stratification system\" is sometimes used to refer to the complex \n social relationships \n and \n social structure \n that generate these observed inequalities The key components of such systems are a \n social-institutional \n processes that define certain types of goods as valuable and desirable b the \n rules \n of allocation that distribute goods and resources across various positions in the \n division of labor \n e g physician farmer housewife and c the \n social mobility \n processes that link individuals to positions and thereby generate unequal control over valued resources \n Social mobility \n Social mobility is the movement of individuals social groups or categories of people between the layers or strata in a stratification system This movement can be intragenerational within a generation or intergenerational between two or more generations Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification \n Open \n stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between strata typically by placing value on the \n achieved status \n characteristics of individuals Those societies having the highest levels of intragenerational mobility are considered to be the most open and malleable systems of stratification \n Those systems in which there is little to no mobility even on an intergenerational basis are considered closed stratification systems For example in caste systems all aspects of social status are \n ascribed \n such that one's social position at birth is the position one holds for a lifetime \n Theories of stratification \n Historical \n Karl Marx \n Main articles \n Marxism \n Historical materialism \n and \n Base and superstructure \n The \" \n Pyramid of Capitalist System \n \" cartoon is an example of socialist \n critique of capitalism \n and of social stratification \n In Marxist theory the modern \n mode of production \n consists of two main economic parts the base and the superstructure The base encompasses the \n relations of production \n employeremployee work conditions the technical \n division of labour \n and property relations Social class according to Marx is determined by one's relationship to the means of production There exist at least two classes in any class-based society the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labor to the owners of the means of production At times Marx almost hints that the ruling classes seem to own the working class itself as they only have their own \n labor power \n ' \n wage labor \n ' to offer the more powerful in order to survive These relations fundamentally determine the ideas and philosophies of a society and additional classes may form as part of the superstructure Through the ideology of the ruling classthroughout much of history the land-owning \n aristocracy \n false consciousness \n is promoted both through political and non-political institutions but also through the \n arts \n and other elements of \n culture \n When the aristocracy falls the \n bourgeoisie \n become the owners of the means of production in the capitalist system Marx predicted the \n capitalist \n mode would eventually give way through its own internal conflict to revolutionary consciousness and the development of more egalitarian more \n communist \n societies \n Marx also described two other classes the petite \n bourgeoisie \n and the \n lumpenproletariat \n The petite bourgeoisie is like a small business class that never really accumulates enough profit to become part of the bourgeoisie or even challenge their status The lumpenproletariat is the \n underclass \n those with little to no social status This includes prostitutes beggars the \n homeless \n or other \n untouchables \n in a given society Neither of these subclasses has much influence in Marx's two major classes but it is helpful to know that Marx did recognize differences within the classes \n According to \n Marvin Harris \n and \n Tim Ingold \n Lewis Henry Morgan \n 's accounts of egalitarian hunter-gatherers formed part of Karl Marx' and \n Friedrich Engels \n ' inspiration for \n communism \n Morgan spoke of a situation in which people living in the same community pooled their efforts and shared the rewards of those efforts fairly equally He called this \"communism in living \" But when Marx expanded on these ideas he still emphasized an economically oriented culture with \n property \n defining the fundamental relationships between people \n Yet issues of \n ownership \n and property are arguably less emphasized in hunter-gatherer societies \n This combined with the very different social and economic situations of hunter-gatherers may account for many of the difficulties encountered when implementing communism in industrialized states As Ingold points out \"The notion of communism removed from the context of domesticity and harnessed to support a project of social engineering for large-scale industrialized states with populations of millions eventually came to mean something quite different from what Morgan had intended namely a principle of redistribution that would override all ties of a personal or familial nature and cancel out their effects \" \n The counter-argument to Marxist's conflict theory is the theory of structural functionalism argued by \n Kingsley Davis \n and \n Wilbert Moore \n which states that social inequality places a vital role in the smooth operation of a society The \n DavisMoore hypothesis \n argues that a position does not bring power and prestige because it draws a high income rather it draws a high income because it is functionally important and the available personnel is for one reason or another scarce Most high-income jobs are difficult and require a high level of education to perform and their compensation is a motivator in society for people to strive to achieve more \n Max Weber \n Main articles \n Three-component theory of stratification \n and \n Tripartite classification of authority \n Max Weber \n was strongly influenced by Marx's ideas but rejected the possibility of effective communism arguing that it would require an even greater level of detrimental social control and bureaucratization than capitalist society Moreover Weber criticized the \n dialectical \n presumption of a proletariat revolt maintaining it to be unlikely \n Instead he develops a \n three-component theory of stratification \n and the concept of \n life chances \n Weber held there are more class divisions than Marx suggested taking different concepts from both \n functionalist \n and \n Marxist \n theories to create his own system He emphasizes the difference between class status and power and treats these as separate but related sources of power each with different effects on \n social action \n Working half a century later than Marx Weber claims there to be four main social classes the \n upper class \n the \n white collar workers \n the \n petite bourgeoisie \n and the manual \n working class \n Weber's theory more-closely resembles contemporary \n Western \n class structures although economic status does not currently seem to depend strictly on earnings in the way Weber envisioned \n Weber derives many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of \n Germany \n He notes that contrary to Marx's theories stratification is based on more than simple ownership of \n capital \n Weber examines how many members of the aristocracy lacked economic wealth yet had strong political power Many wealthy families lacked prestige and power for example because they were \n Jewish \n Weber introduced three independent factors that form his theory of stratification hierarchy which are class status and power \n Class \n A person's economic position in a society based on birth and individual achievement \n Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification Weber notes how corporate executives control firms they typically do not own Marx would have placed these people in the \n proletariat \n despite their high incomes by virtue of the fact they sell their labor instead of owning capital \n Status \n A person's prestige social honor or popularity in a society Weber notes that political power is not rooted in capital value solely but also in one's individual status Poets or saints for example can have extensive influence on society despite few material resources \n Power \n A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others particularly in their ability to engage \n social change \n For example individuals in government jobs such as an employee of the \n Federal Bureau of Investigation \n or a member of the \n United States Congress \n may hold little property or status but still wield considerable \n social power \n C Wright Mills \n Elite theory \n C Wright Mills \n drawing from the theories of \n Vilfredo Pareto \n and \n Gaetano Mosca \n contends that the imbalance of power in society derives from the complete absence of countervailing powers against corporate leaders of the \n Power elite \n Mills both incorporated and revised \n Marxist \n ideas While he shared \n Marx's \n recognition of a dominant wealthy and powerful class \n Mills \n believed that the source for that power lay not only in the economic realm but also in the political and military arenas \n During the 1950s Mills stated that hardly anyone knew about the power elite's existence some individuals including the elite themselves denied the idea of such a group and other people vaguely believed that a small formation of a powerful elite existed \n \"Some prominent individuals knew that \n Congress \n had permitted a handful of political leaders to make critical decisions about peace and war and that two \n atomic bombs \n had been dropped on Japan in the name of the United States but neither they nor anyone they knew had been consulted \" \n Mills \n explains that the power elite embody a privileged class whose members are able to recognize their high position within society \n In order to maintain their highly exalted position within society members of the power elite tend to marry one another understand and accept one another and also work together \n pp \n The most crucial aspect of the power elite's existence lays within the core of education \n \"Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools which not only open doors to such elite universities as \n Harvard \n Yale \n and \n Princeton \n but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts \" \n p \n Examples of elite members who attended prestigious universities and were members of highly exclusive clubs can be seen in \n George W Bush \n and \n John Kerry \n Both Bush and Kerry were members of the \n Skull and Bones \n club while attending Yale University \n This club includes members of some of the most powerful men of the twentieth century all of which are forbidden to tell others about the secrets of their exclusive club Throughout the years the Skull and Bones club has included \n presidents \n cabinet officers Supreme Court justices spies captains of industry and often their sons and daughters join the exclusive club creating a social and political network like none ever seen before \n The upper class individuals who receive elite educations typically have the essential background and contacts to enter into the three branches of the power elite The political leadership the military circle and the corporate elite \n The Political Leadership \n Mills held that prior to the end of \n World War II \n leaders of corporations became more prominent within the political sphere along with a decline in central decision-making among professional politicians \n The Military Circle \n During the 1950s-1960s increasing concerns about \n warfare \n resulted in top military leaders and issues involving defense funding and military personnel training becoming a top priority within the United States Most of the prominent politicians and corporate leaders have been strong proponents of military spending \n The Corporate Elite \n Mills explains that during the 1950s when the military emphasis was recognized corporate leaders worked with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies Corporate leaders and high-ranking military officers were mutually supportive of each other \n pp \n Mills shows that the power elite has an \"inner-core\" made up of individuals who are able to move from one position of institutional power to another for example a prominent military officer who becomes a political adviser or a powerful politician who becomes a corporate executive \n \"These people have more knowledge and a greater breadth of interests than their colleagues Prominent bankers and financiers who Mills considered 'almost professional go-betweens of economic political and military affairs ' are also members of the elite's inner core \n pp \n Anthropological

\n Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship \n Social anthropology \n Cultural anthropology \n v \n t \n e \n Anthropologists \n dispute the \"universal\" nature of social stratification holding that it is not the standard among all societies John Gowdy writes \"Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive and that social stratification is natural do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples \n Non-stratified \n egalitarian \n or \n acephalous \n \"headless\" societies exist which have little or no concept of social hierarchy political or economic status class or even permanent leadership \n Kinship-orientation \n Original affluent society \n Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as \" \n kinship \n -oriented \" because they appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status These cultures are contrasted with economically oriented cultures including \n states \n in which status and material wealth are prized and stratification competition and conflict are common Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could lead to conflict and instability \n Reciprocal altruism \n is one process by which this is accomplished \n A good example is given by \n Richard Borshay Lee \n in his account of the \n Khoisan \n who practice \n \"insulting the meat \" \n Whenever a hunter makes a kill he is ceaselessly teased and ridiculed in a friendly joking fashion to prevent him from becoming too proud or egotistical The meat itself is then distributed evenly among the entire social group rather than kept by the hunter The level of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill Lee found this out when he purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with and was teased for weeks afterward about it since obtaining that much meat could be interpreted as showing off \n Another example is the \n Indigenous Australians \n of \n Groote Eylandt \n and \n Bickerton Island \n off the coast of \n Arnhem Land \n who have arranged their entire societyspiritually and economicallyaround a kind of \n gift economy \n called \n renunciation \n According to \n David H Turner \n in this arrangement every person is expected to give \n everything \n of any resource they have to any other person who needs or lacks it at the time This has the benefit of largely eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty However misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal \n renunciative economics \n with the competition/scarcity-oriented \n economics \n introduced to Australia by Anglo-European colonists \n Variables in theory and research \n The social status variables underlying social stratification are based in social perceptions and \n attitudes \n about various characteristics of persons and peoples While many such variables cut across time and place the relative \n weight \n placed on each variable and specific combinations of these variables will differ from place to place over time One task of research is to identify accurate \n mathematical models \n that explain how these many variables combine to produce stratification in a given society Grusky provides a good overview of the historical development of sociological theories of social stratification and a summary of contemporary theories and research in this field \n While many of the variables that contribute to an understanding of social stratification have long been identified models of these variables and their role in constituting social stratification are still an active topic of theory and research In general sociologists recognize that there are no \"pure\" economic variables as social factors are integral to economic value However the variables posited to affect social stratification can be loosely divided into economic and other social factors \n Economic \n Economic inequality \n Strictly \n quantitative \n economic variables are more useful to \n describing \n social stratification than \n explaining \n how social stratification is constituted or maintained \n Income \n is the most common variable used to describe stratification and associated \n economic inequality \n in a society \n However the distribution of individual or \n household \n accumulation of \n surplus \n and \n wealth \n tells us more about variation in individual \n well-being \n than does income alone \n Wealth variables can also more vividly illustrate salient variations in the well-being of groups in stratified societies \n Gross Domestic Product \n GDP especially \n per capita \n GDP is sometimes used to describe economic inequality and stratification at the \n international \n or global level \n Social \n Social status \n Social variables both quantitative and \n qualitative \n typically provide the most explanatory power in \n causal \n research regarding social stratification either as \n independent \n variables or as \n intervening variables \n Three important social variables include \n gender \n race \n and \n ethnicity \n which at the least have an intervening effect on social status and stratification in most places throughout the world \n Additional variables include those that describe other ascribed and achieved characteristics such as \n occupation \n and \n skill \n levels \n age \n education \n level education level of parents and \n geographic \n area Some of these variables may have both causal and intervening effects on social status and stratification For example absolute age may cause a low income if one is too young or too old to perform productive work The social perception of age and its role in the workplace which may lead to \n ageism \n typically has an intervening effect on \n employment \n and income \n Social scientists are sometimes interested in quantifying the degree of economic stratification between different social categories such as men and women or workers with different levels of education An index of stratification has been recently proposed by Zhou for this purpose \n Gender \n Gender inequality \n Gender is one of the most pervasive and prevalent social characteristics which people use to make social distinctions between individuals Gender distinctions are found in economic- kinship- and caste-based stratification systems \n Social role \n expectations often form along sex and gender lines Entire societies may be classified by social scientists according to the \n rights \n and \n privileges \n afforded to men or women especially those associated with ownership and inheritance of \n property \n In \n patriarchal \n societies such rights and privileges are \n normatively \n granted to men over women in \n matriarchal \n societies the opposite holds true Sex- and gender-based \n division of labor \n is historically found in the annals of most societies and such divisions increased with the advent of \n industrialization \n Sex-based \n wage discrimination \n exists in some societies such that men typically receive higher wages than women for the same type of work Other differences in employment between men and women lead to an overall gender-based pay-gap in many societies where women as a category earn less than men due to the types of jobs which women are offered and take as well as to differences in the number of hours worked by women \n These and other gender-related values affect the distribution of income wealth and property in a given social order \n Race \n Racism \n Racism consists of both \n prejudice \n and \n discrimination \n based in social perceptions of observable biological differences between peoples It often takes the form of \n social actions \n practices or beliefs or \n political systems \n in which different races are perceived to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other based on presumed shared inheritable traits abilities or qualities In a given society those who share racial characteristics socially perceived as undesirable are typically under-represented in positions of social power i e they become a \n minority category \n in that society Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies including \n assimilation \n exclusion \n oppression \n expulsion \n and \n extermination \n Overt racism usually feeds directly into a stratification system through its effect on social status For example members associated with a particular race may be assigned a \n slave status \n a form of oppression in which the majority refuses to grant basic \n rights \n to a minority that are granted to other members of the society More \n covert racism \n such as that which many scholars posit is practiced in more contemporary societies is socially hidden and less easily detectable Covert racism often feeds into stratification systems as an intervening variable affecting income educational opportunities and housing Both overt and covert racism can take the form of \n structural inequality \n in a society in which \n racism has become institutionalized \n Ethnicity \n Ethnocentricity \n Ethnic prejudice and discrimination operate much the same as do racial prejudice and discrimination in society In fact only recently have scholars begun to differentiate race and ethnicity historically the two were considered to be identical or closely related With the scientific development of \n genetics \n and the \n human genome \n as fields of study most scholars now recognize that \n race \n is socially defined on the basis of biologically determined characteristics that can be observed within a society while ethnicity is defined on the basis of \n culturally \n learned behavior Ethnic identification can include shared cultural heritage such as \n language \n and \n dialect \n symbolic systems \n religion \n mythology \n and \n cuisine \n As with race ethnic categories of persons may be socially defined as minority \n categories \n whose members are under-represented in positions of social power As such ethnic categories of persons can be subject to the same types of majority policies Whether ethnicity feeds into a stratification system as a direct causal factor or as an intervening variable may depend on the level of ethnocentrism within each of the various ethnic populations in a society the amount of conflict over scarce resources and the relative social power held within each ethnic category \n Global stratification \n Main articles \n World-systems theory \n and \n Dependency theory \n The world and the pace of \n social change \n today are very different than in the time of Karl Marx Max Weber or even C Wright Mills \n Globalizing \n forces lead to rapid international integration arising from the interchange of \n world views \n products ideas and other aspects of culture \n Advances in \n transportation \n and \n telecommunications \n infrastructure including the rise of the \n telegraph \n and its posterity the \n Internet \n are major factors in globalization generating further \n interdependence \n of economic and cultural activities \n Like a stratified class system within a nation looking at the \n world economy \n one can see class positions in the unequal distribution of \n capital \n and other resources between nations Rather than having separate national economies nations are considered as participating in this world economy The world economy manifests a global \n division of labor \n with three overarching classes \n core countries \n semi-periphery countries \n and \n periphery countries \n according to World-systems and Dependency theories Core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks and provide international financial services Periphery nations own very little of the world's \n means of production \n even when factories are located in periphery nations and provide low to non-skilled labor Semiperipheral nations are midway between the core and periphery They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies \n Core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production and periphery nations receive the least Furthermore core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from noncore nations at low prices while demanding higher prices for their exports to noncore nations \n A \n global workforce \n employed through a system of \n global labor arbitrage \n ensures that companies in core countries can utilize the cheapest semi-and non-skilled labor for production \n Today we have the means to gather and analyze data from economies across the globe Although many societies worldwide have made great strides toward more equality between differing geographic regions in terms of the \n standard of living \n and \n life chances \n afforded to their peoples we still find large gaps between the wealthiest and the poorest within a nation and between the wealthiest and poorest nations of the world \n A January \n Oxfam \n report indicates that the wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population or about billion people \n By contrast for the \n World Bank \n reports that percent of people worldwide around billion live in extreme poverty at or below $1 a day \n Zygmunt Bauman has provocatively observed that the rise of the rich is linked to their capacity to lead highly mobile lives 'Mobility climbs to the rank of the uppermost among coveted values -and the freedom to move perpetually a scarce and unequally distributed commodity fast becomes the main stratifying factor of our late modern or postmodern time ' \n

'effect of uncertainty on objectives' In this definition uncertainties include events which may or may not happen and uncertainties caused by ambiguity or a lack of information It also includes both negative and positive impacts on objectives Many definitions of risk exist in common usage however this definition was developed by an international committee representing over countries and is based on the input of several thousand subject matter experts \n Other \n Very different approaches to risk management are taken in different fields e g \"Risk is the unwanted subset of a set of uncertain outcomes\" Cornelius Keating \n Risk can be seen as relating to the \n probability \n of uncertain future events \n For example according to \n Factor Analysis of Information Risk \n risk is \n the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss In computer science this definition is used by \n The Open Group \n OHSAS Occupational Health & Safety Advisory Services defines risk as the combination of the probability of a hazard resulting in an adverse event and the severity of the event \n In \n information security \n risk is defined as \"the potential that a given \n threat \n will exploit \n vulnerabilities \n of an \n asset \n or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization\" \n Financial risk \n is often defined as the unpredictable variability or \n volatility \n of returns and this would include both potential better-than-expected and worse-than-expected returns References to negative risk below should be read as also applying to positive impacts or opportunity e g for \"loss\" read \"loss or gain\" unless the context precludes this interpretation \n The related terms \" \n threat \n \" and \" \n hazard \n \" are often used to mean something that could cause harm \n Practice areas \n Risk is ubiquitous in all areas of life and risk management is something that we all must do whether we are managing a major organisation or simply crossing the road When describing risk however it is convenient to consider that risk practitioners operate in some specific practice areas \n Economic risk \n Economic risks can be manifested in lower incomes or higher expenditures than expected The causes can be many for instance the hike in the price for raw materials the lapsing of deadlines for construction of a new operating facility disruptions in a production process emergence of a serious competitor on the market the loss of key personnel the change of a political regime or natural disasters \n Health \n Risks in personal health may be reduced by \n primary prevention \n actions that decrease early causes of illness or by \n secondary prevention \n actions after a person has clearly measured clinical signs or symptoms recognised as risk factors Tertiary \n prevention \n reduces the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion of \n risk factors \n with individual patients to obtain \n informed consent \n for secondary and tertiary prevention efforts whereas public health efforts in primary prevention require education of the entire population at risk In each case careful communication about risk factors likely outcomes and \n certainty \n must distinguish between causal events that must be decreased and associated events that may be merely consequences rather than causes \n In epidemiology the \n lifetime risk \n of an effect is the \n cumulative incidence \n also called \n incidence proportion \n over an entire lifetime \n Health safety and environment \n In terms of occupational health & safety management the term 'risk' may be defined as the most likely consequence of a hazard combined with the likelihood or probability of it occurring \n Health safety and environment HSE are separate practice areas however they are often linked The reason for this is typically to do with organizational management structures however there are strong links among these disciplines One of the strongest links between these is that a single risk event may have impacts in all three areas albeit over differing timescales For example the uncontrolled release of radiation or a toxic chemical may have immediate short-term safety consequences more protracted health impacts and much longer-term environmental impacts Events such as Chernobyl for example caused immediate deaths and in the longer term deaths from cancers and left a lasting environmental impact leading to birth defects impacts on wildlife etc \n Over time a form of risk analysis called environmental risk analysis has developed Environmental risk analysis is a field of study that attempts to understand events and activities that bring risk to human health or the environment \n Human health and environmental risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome See \n adverse outcome pathway \n As such risk is a function of hazard and exposure Hazard is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed e g the toxicity of a chemical compound Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard Therefore the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero given a person's or other organism's biological makeup activities and location See \n exposome \n Another example of health risks are when certain behaviours such as \n risky sexual behaviours \n increase the likelihood of contracting HIV \n Social aspects \n Individual risk perception and risk taking can also be influenced by social factors A study using representative household data in the US Italy and Austria finds evidence that risk taking levels can be influenced by the immediate social environment and by the welfare regime of a state i e different support networks The study also finds that these factors can interact \n Cass Sunstein holds that risk not only is a social construct but also a correct diagnosis is vital to understand its evolution State should appeal to the net of experts to avoid populism or risk-neglect which consists in biased information respecting to the probabilities of risk \n Information technology and information security \n IT risk \n Information technology risk \n or \n IT risk \n IT-related risk \n is a risk related to information technology This relatively new term was developed as a result of an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports \n The increasing dependencies of modern society on information and computers networks both in private and public sectors including military \n has led to new terms like \n IT risk \n and \n Cyberwarfare \n Main articles \n Information assurance \n and \n Information security \n Information security \n means protecting information and \n information systems \n from unauthorised access use disclosure disruption modification perusal inspection recording or destruction \n Information security grew out of practices and procedures of \n computer security \n Information security has grown to \n information assurance IA \n i e is the practice of managing risks related to the use processing storage and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes \n While focused dominantly on information in digital form the full range of IA encompasses not only digital but also analogue or physical form \n Information assurance is interdisciplinary and draws from multiple fields including accounting fraud examination \n forensic science \n management science \n systems engineering \n security engineering \n and \n criminology \n in addition to computer science \n So \n IT risk \n is narrowly focused on computer security while \n information security \n extends to risks related to other forms of information paper microfilm \n Information assurance \n risks include the ones related to the consistency of the business information stored in IT systems and the information stored by other means and the relevant business consequences \n Insurance \n Insurance is a risk treatment option which involves risk sharing It can be considered as a form of contingent capital and is akin to purchasing an \n option \n in which the buyer pays a small premium to be protected from a potential large loss \n Insurance risk is often taken by insurance companies who then bear a pool of risks including market risk credit risk operational risk interest rate risk mortality risk longevity risks etc \n Business and management \n Means of assessing risk vary widely between professions Indeed they may define these professions for example a doctor manages medical risk while a civil engineer manages risk of structural failure A professional \n code of ethics \n is usually focused on risk assessment and mitigation by the professional on behalf of client public society or life in general \n In the workplace incidental and \n inherent risks \n exist Incidental risks are those that occur naturally in the business but are not part of the core of the business Inherent risks have a negative effect on the operating profit of the business \n In human services \n The experience of many people who rely on human services for support is that 'risk' is often used as a reason to prevent them from gaining further independence or fully accessing the community and that these services are often unnecessarily risk averse \n \"People's autonomy used to be compromised by institution walls now it's too often our risk management practices\" according to \n John O'Brien \n Michael Fischer and Ewan Ferlie find that contradictions between formal risk controls and the role of subjective factors in human services such as the role of emotions and ideology can undermine service values so producing tensions and even intractable and 'heated' conflict \n High reliability organisations HROs \n A \n high reliability organisation \n HRO is an organisation that has succeeded in avoiding catastrophes in an environment where \n normal accidents \n can be expected due to risk factors and \n complexity \n Most studies of HROs involve areas such as nuclear aircraft carriers air traffic control aerospace and nuclear power stations Organizations such as these share in common the ability to consistently operate safely in complex interconnected environments where a single failure in one component could lead to catastrophe Essentially they are organisations which appear to operate 'in spite' of an enormous range of risks \n Some of these industries manage risk in a highly quantified and enumerated way These include the \n nuclear power \n and \n aircraft industries \n where the possible failure of a complex series of engineered systems could result in highly undesirable outcomes The usual measure of risk for a class of events is then \n R \n = probability of the event the severity of the consequence \n The total risk is then the sum of the individual class-risks see below \n citation needed \n In the nuclear industry consequence is often measured in terms of off-site radiological release and this is often banded into five or six-decade-wide bands \n clarification needed \n The risks are evaluated using fault tree/event tree techniques see \n safety engineering \n Where these risks are low they are normally considered to be \"broadly acceptable\" A higher level of risk typically up to to times what is considered broadly acceptable has to be justified against the costs of reducing it further and the possible benefits that make it tolerablethese risks are described as \"Tolerable if \n ALARP \n \" where ALARP stands for \"as low as reasonably practicable\" Risks beyond this level are classified as \"intolerable\" \n The level of risk deemed broadly acceptable has been considered by regulatory bodies in various countriesan early attempt by UK government regulator and academic \n F R Farmer \n used the example of hill-walking and similar activities which have definable risks that people appear to find acceptable This resulted in the so-called Farmer Curve of acceptable probability of an event versus its consequence \n The technique as a whole is usually referred to as probabilistic risk assessment PRA or probabilistic safety assessment PSA See \n WASH-1400 \n for an example of this approach \n Finance \n Financial risk \n In finance risk is the chance that the return achieved on an investment will be different from that expected and also takes into account the size of the difference This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment In a view advocated by Damodaran risk includes not only \" \n downside risk \n \" but also \"upside risk\" returns that exceed expectations \n Some regard the \n standard deviation \n of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment as providing some historical measure of risk see modern portfolio theory Financial risk may be market-dependent determined by numerous market factors or operational resulting from fraudulent behaviour e g \n Bernard Madoff \n A fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return see \n modern portfolio theory \n The greater the potential return one might seek the greater the risk that one generally assumes A free market reflects this principle in the pricing of an instrument strong demand for a safer instrument drives its price higher and its return correspondingly lower while weak demand for a riskier instrument drives its price lower and its potential return thereby higher For example a US Treasury bond is considered to be one of the safest investments In comparison to an investment or speculative grade corporate bond US Treasury notes and bonds yield lower rates of return The reason for this is that a corporation is more likely to default on debt than the US government Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher investors are offered a correspondingly higher rate of return \n A popular \n risk measure \n is \n Value-at-Risk \n VaR \n There are different types of VaR long term VaR marginal VaR factor VaR and shock VaR The latter is used in measuring risk during the extreme market stress conditions \n In finance \n risk \n has no single definition \n Artzner et al \n write \"we call risk the investor's future net worth\" In Novak \n \"risk is a possibility of an undesirable event\" \n In financial markets one may need to measure \n credit risk \n information timing and source risk probability model risk operational risk and \n legal risk \n if there are regulatory or civil actions taken as a result of \" \n investor's regret \n \" \n With the advent of automation in financial markets the concept of \"real-time risk\" has gained a lot of attention Aldridge and Krawciw \n define real-time risk as the probability of instantaneous or near-instantaneous loss and can be due to flash crashes other market crises malicious activity by selected market participants and other events A well-cited example \n of real-time risk was a US $440 million loss incurred within minutes by Knight Capital Group KCG on August the culprit was a poorly-tested runaway algorithm deployed by the firm Regulators have taken notice of real-time risk as well Basel III \n requires real-time risk management framework for bank stability \n It is not always obvious if \n financial instruments \n are \" \n hedging \n \" purchasing/selling a financial instrument specifically to reduce or cancel out the risk in another investment or \"speculation\" increasing measurable risk and exposing the investor to catastrophic loss in pursuit of very high windfalls that increase expected value \n Some people may be \" \n risk seeking \n \" i e their \n utility function \n 's second derivative is positive Such an individual willingly pays a premium to assume risk e g buys a lottery ticket \n Financial auditing \n Audit risk \n The \n financial audit risk model \n expresses the risk of an \n auditor \n providing an inappropriate opinion or material misstatement of a commercial entity's financial statements It can be analytically expressed as \n AR \n = \n IR \n CR \n DR \n { displaystyle { text{AR}}={ text{IR}} times { text{CR}} times { text{DR}}} \n where AR is \n audit risk \n IR is \n inherent risk \n CR is \n control risk \n and DR is \n detection risk \n Note As defined audit risk does not consider the impact of an auditor misstatement and so is stated as a simple probability The impact of misstatement must be considered when determining an acceptable audit risk \n Security \n AT YOUR OWN RISK \n Popular labelling \n Security risk management involves protection of assets from harm caused by deliberate acts A more detailed definition is \"A security risk is any event that could result in the compromise of organizational assets i e the unauthorized use loss damage disclosure or modification of organizational assets for the profit personal interest or political interests of individuals groups or other entities constitutes a compromise of the asset and includes the risk of harm to people Compromise of organizational assets may adversely affect the enterprise its business units and their clients As such consideration of security risk is a vital component of risk management \" \n Human factors \n Main articles \n Decision theory \n and \n Prospect theory \n One of the growing areas of focus in risk management is the field of \n human factors \n where behavioural and organizational psychology underpin our understanding of risk based decision making This field considers questions such as \"how do we make risk based decisions?\" \"why are we irrationally more scared of sharks and terrorists than we are of motor vehicles and medications?\" \n In \n decision theory \n regret and anticipation of regret can play a significant part in decision-making distinct from \n risk aversion \n preferring the status quo in case one becomes worse off \n Framing \n is a fundamental problem with all forms of risk assessment In particular because of \n bounded rationality \n our brains get overloaded so we take mental shortcuts the risk of extreme events is discounted because the probability is too low to evaluate intuitively As an example one of the leading causes of death is \n road accidents \n caused by \n drunk driving \n partly because any given driver frames the problem by largely or totally ignoring the risk of a serious or fatal accident \n For instance an extremely disturbing event an attack by hijacking or \n moral hazards \n may be ignored in analysis despite the fact it has occurred and has a nonzero probability Or an event that everyone agrees is inevitable may be ruled out of analysis due to greed or an unwillingness to admit that it is believed to be inevitable These human tendencies for error and \n wishful thinking \n often affect even the most rigorous applications of the \n scientific method \n and are a major concern of the \n philosophy of science \n All \n decision-making under uncertainty \n must consider \n cognitive bias \n cultural bias \n and notational bias No group of people assessing risk is immune to \" \n groupthink \n \" acceptance of obviously wrong answers simply because it is socially painful to disagree where there are \n conflicts of interest \n Framing involves other information that affects the outcome of a risky decision The right prefrontal cortex has been shown to take a more global perspective \n while greater left prefrontal activity relates to local or focal processing \n From the Theory of Leaky Modules \n McElroy and Seta proposed that they could predictably alter the framing effect by the selective manipulation of regional prefrontal activity with finger tapping or monaural listening \n The result was as expected Rightward tapping or listening had the effect of narrowing attention such that the frame was ignored This is a practical way of manipulating regional cortical activation to affect risky decisions especially because directed tapping or listening is easily done \n Psychology of risk taking \n A growing area of research has been to examine various psychological aspects of risk taking Researchers typically run randomised experiments with a treatment and control group to ascertain the effect of different psychological factors that may be associated with risk taking Thus positive and negative feedback about past risk taking can affect future risk taking In an experiment people who were led to believe they are very competent at decision making saw more opportunities in a risky choice and took more risks while those led to believe they were not very competent saw more threats and took fewer risks \n Maintenance \n The concept of risk-based maintenance is an advanced form of \n Reliability centred maintenance \n In case of chemical industries apart from probability of failure consequences of failure is also very important Therefore the selection of maintenance policies should be based on risk instead of reliability Risk-based maintenance methodology acts as a tool for maintenance planning and decision making to reduce the probability of failure and its consequences In risk-based maintenance decision making the maintenance resources can be used optimally based on the risk class high medium or low of equipment or machines to achieve tolerable risk criteria \n Cybersecurity \n Closely related to information assurance and security risk cybersecurity is the application of system security engineering \n in order to address the compromise of company cyber-assets required for business or mission purposes In order to address cyber-risk cybersecurity applies security to the supply chain the design and production environment for a product or service and the product itself in order to provide efficient and appropriate security commensurate with the value of the asset to the mission or business process \n Risk assessment and analysis \n Main articles \n Risk assessment \n and \n Operational risk management \n Since risk assessment and management is essential in security management both are tightly related Security assessment methodologies like \n CRAMM \n contain risk assessment modules as an important part of the first steps of the methodology On the other hand risk assessment methodologies like \n Mehari \n evolved to become security assessment methodologies An \n ISO \n standard on risk management Principles and guidelines on implementation was published under code \n ISO \n on November \n Quantitative analysis \n There are many formal methods used to \"measure\" risk \n Often the probability of a negative event is estimated by using the frequency of past similar events Probabilities for rare failures may be difficult to estimate This makes risk assessment difficult in hazardous industries for example nuclear energy where the frequency of failures is rare while harmful consequences of failure are severe \n Statistical methods may also require the use of a \n cost function \n which in turn may require the calculation of the cost of loss of a human life This is a difficult problem One approach is to ask what people are willing to pay to insure against death \n or radiological release e g GBq of radio-iodine \n citation needed \n but as the answers depend very strongly on the circumstances it is not clear that this approach is effective \n Risk is often measured as the \n expected value \n of an undesirable outcome This combines the probabilities of various possible events and some assessment of the corresponding harm into a single value See also \n Expected utility \n The simplest case is a binary possibility of \n Accident \n or \n No accident \n The associated formula for calculating risk is then \n R \n = \n probability of the accident occurring \n expected loss in case of the accident \n { displaystyle { text{R}}= { text{probability of the accident occurring}} times { text{expected loss in case of the accident}} } \n For example if performing activity \n X \n has a probability of of suffering an accident of \n A \n with a loss of then total risk is a loss of the product of and \n Situations are sometimes more complex than the simple binary possibility case In a situation with several possible accidents total risk is the sum of the risks for each different accident provided that the outcomes are comparable \n R \n = \n For all accidents \n probability of the accident occurring \n expected loss in case of the accident \n { displaystyle { text{R}}= sum { text{For all accidents}} { text{probability of the accident occurring}} times { text{expected loss in case of the accident}} } \n For example if performing activity \n X \n has a probability of of suffering an accident of \n A \n with a loss of and a probability of of suffering an accident of type \n B \n with a loss of then total loss expectancy is which is equal to a loss of from an accident of type \n A \n and from an accident of type \n B \n One of the first major uses of this concept was for the planning of the \n Delta Works \n in a flood protection program in the \n Netherlands \n with the aid of the mathematician \n David van Dantzig \n The kind of risk analysis pioneered there has become common today in fields like nuclear power \n aerospace \n and the \n chemical industry \n In statistical decision theory the \n risk function \n is defined as the expected value of a given \n loss function \n as a function of the \n decision rule \n used to make decisions in the face of uncertainty \n Fear as intuitive risk assessment \n People may rely on their \n fear \n and hesitation to keep them out of the most profoundly unknown circumstances Fear is a response to perceived danger Risk could be said to be the way we collectively measure and share this \"true fear\"a fusion of rational doubt irrational fear and a set of unquantified biases from our own experience \n The field of \n behavioural finance \n focuses on human risk-aversion asymmetric regret and other ways that human financial behaviour varies from what analysts call \"rational\" Risk in that case is the degree of \n uncertainty \n associated with a \n return \n on an asset Recognizing and respecting the irrational influences on human decision making may do much to reduce disasters caused by naive risk assessments that presume rationality but in fact merely fuse many shared biases \n Anxiety risk and decision making \n Fear anxiety and risk \n According to one set of definitions fear is a fleeting emotion ascribed to a particular object while \n anxiety \n is a trait of fear this is referring to \"trait anxiety\" as distinct from how the term \"anxiety\" is generally used that lasts longer and is not attributed to a specific stimulus these particular definitions are not used by all authors cited on this page \n Some studies show a link between anxious behaviour and risk the chance that an outcome will have an unfavorable result \n Joseph Forgas introduced \n valence \n based research where emotions are grouped as either positive or negative Lerner and Keltner Positive emotions such as happiness are believed to have more optimistic risk assessments and negative emotions such as anger have pessimistic risk assessments As an emotion with a negative valence fear and therefore anxiety has long been associated with negative risk perceptions Under the more recent appraisal tendency framework of Jennifer Lerner et al which refutes Forgas' notion of valence and promotes the idea that specific emotions have distinctive influences on judgments fear is still related to pessimistic expectations \n Psychologists have demonstrated that increases in anxiety and increases in \n risk perception \n are related and people who are habituated to anxiety experience this awareness of risk more intensely than normal individuals \n In decision-making anxiety promotes the use of biases and quick thinking to evaluate risk This is referred to as affect-as-information according to Clore However the accuracy of these risk perceptions when making choices is not known \n Consequences of anxiety \n Experimental studies show that brief surges in anxiety are correlated with surges in general risk perception \n Anxiety exists when the presence of threat is perceived Maner and Schmidt \n As risk perception increases it stays related to the particular source impacting the mood change as opposed to spreading to unrelated risk factors \n This increased awareness of a threat is significantly more emphasised in people who are conditioned to anxiety \n For example anxious individuals who are predisposed to generating reasons for negative results tend to exhibit pessimism \n Also findings suggest that the perception of a lack of control and a lower inclination to participate in risky decision-making across various behavioural circumstances is associated with individuals experiencing relatively high levels of trait anxiety \n In the previous instance there is supporting clinical research that links emotional evaluation of control the anxiety that is felt and the option of risk avoidance \n There are various views presented that anxious/fearful emotions cause people to access involuntary responses and judgments when making decisions that involve risk Joshua A Hemmerich et al probes deeper into anxiety and its impact on choices by exploring \"risk-as-feelings\" which are quick automatic and natural reactions to danger that are based on emotions This notion is supported by an experiment that engages physicians in a simulated perilous surgical procedure It was demonstrated that a measurable amount of the participants' anxiety about patient outcomes was related to previous experimentally created regret and worry and ultimately caused the physicians to be led by their feelings over any information or guidelines provided during the mock surgery Additionally their emotional levels adjusted along with the simulated patient status suggest that anxiety level and the respective decision made are correlated with the type of bad outcome that was experienced in the earlier part of the experiment \n Similarly another view of anxiety and decision-making is dispositional anxiety where emotional states or \n moods \n are cognitive and provide information about future pitfalls and rewards Maner and Schmidt When experiencing anxiety individuals draw from personal judgments referred to as pessimistic outcome appraisals These emotions promote biases for risk avoidance and promote risk tolerance in decision-making \n Dread risk \n It is common for people to dread some risks but not others They tend to be very afraid of epidemic diseases nuclear power plant failures and plane accidents but are relatively unconcerned about some highly frequent and deadly events such as traffic crashes household accidents and medical errors One key distinction of dreadful risks seems to be their potential for catastrophic consequences \n threatening to kill a large number of people within a short period of time \n For example immediately after the September attacks many Americans were afraid to fly and took their car instead a decision that led to a significant increase in the number of fatal crashes in the time period following the 9/11 event compared with the same time period before the attacks \n Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why people fear dread risks First the psychometric paradigm \n suggests that high lack of control high catastrophic potential and severe consequences account for the increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks Second because people estimate the frequency of a risk by recalling instances of its occurrence from their social circle or the media they may overvalue relatively rare but dramatic risks because of their overpresence and undervalue frequent less dramatic risks \n Third according to the preparedness hypothesis people are prone to fear events that have been particularly threatening to survival in human evolutionary history \n Given that in most of human evolutionary history people lived in relatively small groups rarely exceeding people \n a dread risk which kills many people at once could potentially wipe out one's whole group Indeed research found \n that people's fear peaks for risks killing around people but does not increase if larger groups are killed Fourth fearing dread risks can be an ecologically rational strategy \n Besides killing a large number of people at a single point in time dread risks reduce the number of children and young adults who would have potentially produced offspring Accordingly people are more concerned about risks killing younger and hence more fertile groups \n Anxiety and judgmental accuracy \n The relationship between higher levels of risk perception and \"judgmental accuracy\" in anxious individuals remains unclear Joseph I Constans There is a chance that \"judgmental accuracy\" is correlated with heightened anxiety Constans conducted a study to examine how worry propensity and current mood and trait anxiety might influence college student's estimation of their performance on an upcoming exam and the study found that worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias errors in their risk assessments even after variance attributable to current mood and trait anxiety had been removed \n Another experiment suggests that trait anxiety is associated with pessimistic risk appraisals heightened perceptions of the probability and degree of suffering associated with a negative experience while controlling for depression \n Other considerations \n Risk and uncertainty \n In his seminal work \n Risk Uncertainty and Profit \n Frank Knight \n established the distinction between risk and uncertainty \n Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk from which it has never been properly separated The term \"risk \" as loosely used in everyday speech and in economic discussion really covers two things which functionally at least in their causal relations to the phenomena of economic organization are categorically different The essential fact is that \"risk\" means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomenon depending on which of the two is really present and operating It will appear that a measurable uncertainty or \"risk\" proper as we shall use the term is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all We accordingly restrict the term \"uncertainty\" to cases of the non-quantitive type \n Thus \n Knightian uncertainty \n is immeasurable not possible to calculate while in the Knightian sense risk is measurable \n Another distinction between risk and uncertainty is proposed by Douglas Hubbard \n Uncertainty \n The lack of complete certainty that is the existence of more than one possibility The \"true\" outcome/state/result/value is not known \n Measurement of uncertainty \n A set of probabilities assigned to a set of possibilities Example \"There is a 60% chance this market will double in five years\" \n Risk \n A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss catastrophe or other undesirable outcome \n Measurement of risk \n A set of possibilities each with quantified probabilities and quantified losses Example \"There is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs\" \n In this sense one may have uncertainty without risk but not risk without uncertainty We can be uncertain about the winner of a contest but unless we have some personal stake in it we have no risk If we bet money on the outcome of the contest then we have a risk In both cases there are more than one outcome The measure of uncertainty refers only to the probabilities assigned to outcomes while the measure of risk requires both probabilities for outcomes and losses quantified for outcomes \n Risk attitude appetite and tolerance \n Risk aversion \n The terms \n risk attitude \n appetite \n and \n tolerance \n are often used similarly to describe an organisation's or individual's attitude towards risk-taking One's attitude may be described as \n risk-averse \n risk-neutral \n or \n risk-seeking \n Risk tolerance looks at acceptable/unacceptable deviations from what is expected \n clarification needed \n Risk appetite looks at how much risk one is willing to accept There can still be deviations that are within a risk appetite For example recent research finds that insured individuals are significantly likely to divest from risky asset holdings in response to a decline in health controlling for variables such as income age and out-of-pocket medical expenses \n Gambling is a risk-increasing investment wherein money on hand is risked for a possible large return but with the possibility of losing it all Purchasing a lottery ticket is a very risky investment with a high chance of no return and a small chance of a very high return In contrast putting money in a bank at a defined rate of interest is a risk-averse action that gives a guaranteed return of a small gain and precludes other investments with possibly higher gain The possibility of getting no return on an investment is also known as the \n rate of ruin \n Risk as a vector quantity \n Hubbard also argues that defining risk as the product of impact and probability presumes unrealistically that decision-makers are \n risk-neutral \n pageneeded \n A risk-neutral person's utility is proportional to the \n expected value \n of the payoff For example a risk-neutral person would consider 20% chance of winning $1million exactly as desirable as getting a certain $200 However most decision-makers are not actually risk-neutral and would not consider these equivalent choices This gave rise to \n prospect theory \n and \n cumulative prospect theory \n Hubbard proposes to instead describe risk as a \n vector \n quantity that distinguishes the probability and magnitude of a risk Risks are simply described as a set or function \n vague \n of possible payoffs gains or losses with their associated probabilities This array is collapsed into a scalar value according to a decision-maker's \n risk tolerance \n List of

\n Peace disambiguation \n A \" \n Kind Angel of Peace monument \n \" in the city of Donetsk Ukraine by Russian artist \n Peter Stronsky \n Peace \n is the concept of harmony and the absence of hostility In a behavioral sense peace is generally understood to be a lack of \n conflict \n and \n freedom \n from \n fear \n of \n violence \n between heterogenous social groups Throughout history benevolent leaders have often exhibited a certain type of behavioral or political restraint which in turn has often resulted in the establishment of \n regional peace \n or economic growth through various forms of agreements or \n peace treaties \n Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the de-escalation of conflicts or in multilateral or bilateral peace talks The avoidance of \n war \n or violent \n hostility \n is often the result of compromise and is often initiated with thoughtful active listening and communication which may tend to enable a greater genuine mutual understanding \n In a psychological sense peace is perhaps less well defined but at least of an equal value to or of a greater value than \"behavioral peace \" Peaceful behavior has often been found to have been the result of a certain type of a \"peaceful inner disposition\" on the part of some Some have expressed the belief that peace is a certain quality of inner tranquility which does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence \n The acquisition of such a \"peaceful internal disposition\" would seem to possibly be a valuable asset capable of assisting in the resolution of otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests \n Such individuals are sometimes known to de-escalate conflicts or to improve emotions through compliments or generosity Small gestures of generosity that are reciprocated may be followed with even more gestures Benevolent generosity can eventually become a pattern that may become a lasting basis for improved relations Peace talks often start without preconditions and preconceived notions because they are more than just negotiating opportunities They place attention on peace itself over and above what may have been previously perceived as the competing needs or interests of separate individuals or parties in a way which can sometimes derive unexpected yet beneficial results Peace talks are sometimes also uniquely important learning opportunities for the individuals or parties involved \n Etymology \n Religious beliefs \n Christianity \n Islam \n Buddhism \n Hinduism \n Inner peace meditation and

\n But \n Pes \n itself comes from the \n Latin \n pax \n meaning \"peace compact agreement treaty of peace tranquility absence of hostility harmony \" The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c as a translation of the Hebrew word \n shalom \n which according to Jewish theology comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete whole' \n Although 'peace' is the usual translation however it is an incomplete one because 'shalom ' which is also cognate with the Arabic \n salaam \n has multiple other meanings in addition to peace including justice good health safety well-being prosperity equity security good fortune and friendliness as well as simply the greetings \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" \n citation needed \n At a personal level peaceful behaviors are kind considerate \n respectful \n just and tolerant of others' beliefs and behaviors tending to manifest \n goodwill \n This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself as in being \"at peace\" in one's own mind as found in European references from c The early English term is also used in the sense of \" \n quiet \n \" reflecting calm serene and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek \n tranquility \n an absence of disturbance or agitation \n In many languages the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell for example the Hawaiian word \n aloha \n as well as the Arabic word \n salaam \n In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell especially for the dead as in the phrase \n rest in peace \n Wolfgang Dietrich \n in his research project which led to the book \n The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies \n maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world Later in his \n Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture \n he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families Energetic/Harmony Moral/Justice Modern/Security Postmodern/Truth and Transrational a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families and the society \n Religious beliefs \n Statue of \n Eirene \n goddess of peace in ancient Greek religion with her son Pluto \n Religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life including the conflicts between among and within persons and societies In ancient \n Greek-speaking areas \n the virtue of peace was \n personified \n as the goddess \n Eirene \n and in \n Latin-speaking areas \n as the goddess \n Pax \n Her image was typically represented by ancient sculptors as that of a full-grown woman usually with a \n horn of plenty \n and \n scepter \n and sometimes with a \n torch \n or \n olive leaves \n Christianity \n Christians \n who believe \n Jesus of Nazareth \n to be the \n Jewish Messiah \n called \n Christ \n meaning Anointed One \n interpret Isaiah as a \n messianic prophecy \n of Jesus in which he is called the \" \n Prince of Peace \n \" \n In the \n Gospel of Luke \n Zechariah \n celebrates his son \n John \n And you child will be called prophet of the Most High for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow to guide our feet into the path of peace \n Numerous pontifical documents on the Holy Rosary document a continuity of views of the Popes to have confidence in the Holy \n Rosary \n as a means to foster peace Subsequently to the Encyclical Mense maio in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary \"the prayer so dear to the Virgin and so much recommended by the Supreme Pontiffs \" and as reaffirmed in the encyclical Christi Matri to implore peace Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic Recurrens mensis October that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the great gift of peace \n Islam \n Islam \n derived from the root word salam which literally means peace Muslims are called followers of Islam \n Quran \n clearly stated \"Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah Unquestionably by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured\" and stated \"O you who have believed when you are told \"Space yourselves\" in assemblies then make space Allah will make space for you And when you are told \"Arise \" then arise Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees And Allah is Acquainted with what you do \" \n Buddhism \n Buddhists \n believe that peace can be attained once all suffering ends They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings in the extreme greed aversions fears or delusions To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace followers in the path of the \n Buddha \n adhere to a set of teachings called the \n Four Noble Truths \n a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy \n Hinduism \n Hindu \n texts contain the following passages \n May there be peace in the heavens peace in the atmosphere peace on the earth Let there be coolness in the water healing in the herbs and peace radiating from the trees Let there be harmony in the planets and in the stars and perfection in eternal knowledge May everything in the universe be at peace Let peace pervade everywhere at all times May I experience that peace within my own heart \n Yajur Veda \n Let us not concord with our own people and concord with people who are strangers to us Celestial Twins create between us and the strangers a unity of hearts May we unite in our minds unite in our purposes and not fight against the heavenly spirit within us Let not the battle-cry rise amidst many slain nor the arrows of the war-god fall with the break of day \n Yajur Veda \n A superior being does not render evil for evil This is a maxim one should observe One should never harm the wicked or the good or even animals meriting death A noble soul will exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or cruel deeds Who is without fault? \n

Valmiki Ramayana \n Inner peace meditation and prayerfulness \n Inner peace \n Buddhist monk during meditation near Phu Soidao Nationalpark \n Psychological or inner peace i e peace of mind refers to a state of being internally or spiritually at peace with sufficient \n knowledge \n and understanding to keep oneself calm in the face of apparent discord or stress Being internally \"at peace\" is considered by many to be a healthy mental state or \n homeostasis \n and to be the opposite of feeling stressful mentally anxious or emotionally unstable Within the meditative traditions the psychological or inward achievement of \"peace of mind\" is often associated with bliss and happiness \n Peace of mind serenity and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress In some meditative traditions inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation prayer t'ai chi ch'uan \n tijqun \n yoga or other various types of mental or physical disciplines Many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself An emphasis on finding one's inner peace is often associated with traditions such as \n Buddhism \n Hinduism \n and some traditional \n Christian \n contemplative practices such as \n monasticism \n as well as with the \n New Age \n movement \n Satyagraha \n Satyagraha \n Satyagraha \n Sanskrit \n satygraha \n is a philosophy and practice of \n nonviolent resistance \n developed by \n Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi \n He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for \n Indian independence \n and also during his earlier struggles in \n South Africa \n The word \n satyagraha \n itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa 'Indian Opinion' when he realized that neither the common contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict According to Gandhi's autobiography the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi presumably no relation who submitted the entry 'sadagraha' which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha' Etymologically this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness' and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force' \n Martin Luther King Jr \n president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Mathew Ahmann executive director of the National Catholic Conference for Interrracial Justice at a civil rights march on Washington D C \n Satyagraha theory also influenced \n Martin Luther King Jr \n during the campaigns he led during the \n civil rights movement \n in the United States The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable Therefore it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace As Gandhi wrote \"They say 'means are after all means' I would say 'means are after all everything' As the means so the end \" \n A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi but also to \n A J Muste \n sums it up 'There is no way to peace peace is the way ' \n Justice and injustice \n Since classical times it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures In his book \n Agricola \n the Roman historian \n Tacitus \n includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome One that Tacitus says is by the \n Caledonian \n chieftain \n Calgacus \n ends \n Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium atque ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant \n To ravage to slaughter to usurp under false titles they call empire and where they make a desert they call it peace Oxford Revised Translation \n Discussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace Is it simple absence of mass organized killing war or does peace require a particular morality and justice? \n just peace \n A peace must be seen at least in two forms \n A simple silence of arms absence of \n war \n Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations which are characterized by terms such as justice mutual respect respect for law and good will \n More recently advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive non-violent \n Restorative Justice \n methods and many of those studying the success of these methods including a \n United Nations working group on Restorative Justice \n have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace From the late 2000s on a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed \n which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory \n Long periods \n List of periods of regional peace \n The longest continuing period of neutrality among currently existing states is observed in \n Switzerland \n which has had an official policy of neutrality and general peace since for years as of This was made possible partly by the periods of relative peace in Europe and the world known as \n Pax Britannica \n 1815-1914 \n Pax Europaea \n / \n Pax Americana \n since 1950s and \n Pax Atomica \n also since the 1950s \n Other examples of long periods of peace are \n the \n isolationistic \n Edo period \n also

and activism \n Pacifism \n Pacifism \n A \n peace sign \n which is widely associated with pacifism \n Pacifism is the categorical opposition to the behaviors of \n war \n or \n violence \n as a means of settling disputes or of gaining advantage Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors such as the military or arms manufacturers to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force Such groups which sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include \n anarchists \n and \n libertarians \n Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance including defense of self and others \n Pacifism may be based on \n moral \n principles a \n deontological \n view or \n pragmatism \n a \n consequentialist \n view Principled pacifism holds that all forms of violent behavior are inappropriate responses to conflict and are morally wrong Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found Pacifists in general reject theories of \n Just War \n Pacifism tends to place its initial focus on the need for a \"peaceful behavior\" ahead of any focus on the need for a \"peaceful inner disposition \" \n Organizations \n United Nations \n United Nations \n The United Nations UN is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law international security economic development social progress human rights and achieving \n world peace \n The UN was founded in after World War II to replace

military decorations \n The peacekeeping force as a whole received the \n Nobel Peace Prize \n in \n League of Nations \n The principal forerunner of the United Nations was the \n League of Nations \n It was created at the \n Paris Peace Conference of \n and emerged from the advocacy of \n Woodrow Wilson \n and other idealists during World War I The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the \n Treaty of Versailles \n in and the League was based in \n Geneva \n until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s for example amongst members of the \n League of Nations Union \n gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany Fascist Italy and Japan \n One of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir \n Alfred Zimmern \n Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League such as \n Gilbert Murray \n and \n Florence Stawell \n - the so-called \"Greece and peace\" set - he came to this from the study of the \n classics \n The creation of the League of Nations and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues expressed for example by the \n Union for Democratic Control \n during World War I also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs such as the \n Council on Foreign Relations \n in New York and the \n Royal Institute of International Affairs \n at \n Chatham House \n in London At the same time the academic

abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses \" \n Rhodes Scholarships and other fellowships \n In creating the \n Rhodes Scholarships \n for outstanding students from the United States Germany and much of the British Empire \n Cecil Rhodes \n wrote in that 'the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie' \n This peace purpose of the Rhodes Scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century and became prominent again in recent years under Warden of the Rhodes House \n Donald Markwell \n a historian of thought about the causes of war and peace \n This vision greatly influenced Senator \n J William Fulbright \n in the

Peace and conflict studies Conceptions of peace \n Many different theories of \"peace\" exist in the world of \n peace studies \n which involves the study of de-escalation conflict transformation disarmament and cessation of violence \n The definition of \"peace\" can vary with religion culture or subject of study \n One definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences tolerance persists conflicts are resolved through dialog people's rights are respected and their voices are heard and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension \n Game theory \n Peace war game \n The \n Peace & War Game \n is an approach in \n game theory \n to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts \n The \n iterated game \n hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and \n computer simulations \n to study possible strategies of \n cooperation \n and \n aggression \n As peace makers became richer over time it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated One of the well studied \n strategies \n that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on \n Genghis Khan \n i e a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources This led in contrast to the development of what's known as the \"provokable nice guy \n strategy \n \" a peace-maker until attacked improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked \n There exists a strategy of multiple players who can continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player \n citation needed \n Balance of power theories \n Balance of power international relations \n The classical \"realist\" position is that the key to promoting order between states and so of increasing the chances of peace is the maintenance of a \n balance of power \n between states - a situation where no state is so dominant that it can \"lay down the law to the rest\" Exponents of this view have included \n Metternich \n Bismarck \n Hans Morgenthau \n and \n Henry Kissinger \n A related approach - more in the tradition of \n Hugo Grotius \n than \n Thomas Hobbes \n - was articulated by the so-called \" \n English school of international relations theory \n \" such as \n Martin Wight \n in his book \n Power Politics \n and \n Hedley Bull \n in \n The Anarchical Society \n As the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for \n hegemony \n In the second half of the 20th century and especially during the \n cold war \n a particular form of balance of power - mutual nuclear deterrence - emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace and that the \"nuclear umbrella\" made it \"safe\" for smaller wars e g the \n Vietnam war \n and the Soviet invasion of \n Czechoslovakia \n to end the \n Prague Spring \n so making such wars more likely \n Democratic peace theory \n Democratic peace theory \n The democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another \n Free trade interdependence and globalization \n It was a central tenet of \n classical liberalism \n for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century that free trade promoted peace For example the Cambridge economist \n John Maynard Keynes \n 1883-1946 said that he was \"brought up\" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s \n During the \n economic globalization \n in the decades leading up to World War I writers such as \n Norman Angell \n argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely He made this argument in \n These ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century \n These ideas have seen \n capitalism \n as consistent with even conducive to peace \n Socialism and managed capitalism \n Socialist communist and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries e g \n Lenin \n J A Hobson \n John Strachey \n argued that capitalism caused war e g through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace \n However in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war the economist \n John Maynard Keynes \n 1883-1946 argued that managed capitalism could promote peace This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other and a high degree of freedom of trade These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the \n International Monetary Fund \n and the \n World Bank \n at \n Bretton Woods \n in and later of the \n General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n subsequently the \n World Trade Organization \n Theory of 'active peace' \n Borrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist \n Johan Galtung \n one of the pioneers of the field of \n Peace Research \n on 'Positive Peace' \n and on the writings of Maine Quaker \n Gray Cox \n a consortium of theorists activists and practitioners in the experimental \n John Woolman College \n initiative have arrived at a theory of \"active peace\" This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad which also includes justice and wholeness or well-being an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word \n shalom \n Furthermore the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking peacekeeping and peacebuilding to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure Vermont Quaker John V Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals communities and societies whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues emerging successively into acquiescence pacifism passive resistance active resistance and finally into \n active peace \n dedicating themselves to peacemaking peacekeeping or peace building \n International organization and law \n One of the most influential theories of peace especially since \n Woodrow Wilson \n led the creation of the \n League of Nations \n at the \n Paris Peace Conference \n of is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of \n international law \n promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations the \n United Nations \n and other functional international organizations One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir \n Alfred Zimmern \n for example in his book \n The League of Nations and the Rule of Law \n Trans-national solidarity \n Many \"idealist\" thinkers about international relations - e g in the traditions of \n Kant \n and \n Karl Marx \n - have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples or classes of people spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war \n One version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students - an idea most powerfully advanced by \n Cecil Rhodes \n in the creation of the \n Rhodes Scholarships \n and his successors such as \n J William Fulbright \n Another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources \n Lyotard post-modernism \n Following \n Wolfgang Dietrich \n Wolfgang Stzl \n and the \n Innsbruck School of Peace Studies \n some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace Rather they promote the idea of \n many peaces \n They argue that since no singular correct definition of peace can exist peace should be perceived as a plurality This post-modern understanding of peace s was based on the philosophy of \n Jean Francois Lyotard \n It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace s and elicitive conflict transformation \n In Dietrich enlarged his approach of the \n many peaces \n to the so-called \n five families \n of peace interpretations the energetic moral modern post-modern and trans-rational approach \n Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations \n The systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation the so-called elicitive approach \n Peace without weapons \n The theory of peace without weapons is as old as philosophy and human consciousness This theory holds that weapons in and of themselves are causative of violence aggression and other non-peaceful activities and the removal of all weapons and the military would therefore be a means of preventing such activities thereby inducing peace Some philosophical and legal manifests have been written and distributed on this theme in several languages for select and privileged groups of highly respected and experienced experts in philosophy and law in many countries in all continents worldwide \n citation needed \n These philosophical peace manifests would be suitable for public lectures at universities in many countries in all continents worldwide \n citation needed \n Some pacifist religious denominations such as the \n Quakers \n the \n Amish \n and the \n Mennonites \n traditionally renounce the ownership of weapons and routinely lobby against their manufacture and distributuon \n Peace and conflict studies \n Detail from \n Peace and Prosperity \n Elihu Vedder \n Library of Congress \n Thomas Jefferson Building \n Washington D C \n Peace and conflict studies \n Peace and conflict studies \n is an \n academic field \n

the processes leading to a more desirable \n human condition \n One variation \n Peace studies \n irenology \n is an \n interdisciplinary \n effort aiming at the prevention \n de-escalation \n and

\n economics \n psychology \n sociology \n international relations \n history \n anthropology \n religious studies \n and \n gender studies \n as well as a variety of other disciplines \n Measurement and ranking \n Although peace is widely perceived as something intangible various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it \n The Global Peace Index \n produced by \n the Institute for Economics and Peace \n is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on indicators of the absence of violence and absence of the fear of violence \n The last edition of the Index ranks countries on their internal and external levels of peace \n According to the \n Global Peace Index \n Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Syria is the least peaceful one \n Fragile States Index \n formerly known as the Failed States Index created by the \n Fund for Peace \n focuses on risk for instability or violence in nations This index measures how fragile a state is by indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics social economy and military facets in countries \n The Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan and the least fragile one is Finland \n University of Maryland \n publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace It grades countries with indicators and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is

word \n superstition \n is first used in English in the 15th century modelled after an earlier French \n superstition \n The earliest known use as an English noun occurs in \n Friar Daw's Reply \n ca where the \n foure general synnes \n are enumerated as \n Cediciouns \n supersticions \n e glotouns \n & \n e proude \n The French word together with its Romance cognates Italian \n superstizione \n Spanish \n supersticin \n Portuguese \n superstio \n Catalan \n superstici \n continues Latin \n superstitio \n While the formation of the Latin word is clear from the verb \n super-stare \n \"to stand over stand upon survive\" its original intended sense is less clear It can be interpreted as \"standing over a thing in amazement or awe\" \n but other possibilities have been suggested e g the sense of \n excess \n i e over scrupulousness or over-ceremoniousness in the performing of religious rites or else the \n survival \n of old irrational religious habits \n The earliest known use as a Latin noun occurs in \n Plautus \n Ennius \n and later by \n Pliny \n with the meaning of \n art of divination \n From its use in the \n Classical Latin \n of \n Livy \n and \n Ovid \n 1st century BC the term is used in the pejorative sense it still holds today of an excessive fear of the gods or unreasonable religious belief as opposed to \n religio \n the proper reasonable awe of the gods \n Cicero \n derived the term from \n superstitiosi \n lit those who are \"left over\" i e \"survivors\" \"descendants\" connecting it with excessive anxiety of parents in hoping that their children would survive them to perform their necessary funerary rites \n While \n Cicero \n distinguishes between \n religio \n and \n superstitio \n Lucretius \n uses only the term \n religio \n only with pejorative meaning Throughout all of his work he only distinguished between \n ratio \n and \n religio \n The Latin verb \n superstare \n itself is comparatively young being \"perhaps not ante- \n Augustan \n \" first found in \n Livy \n and the meaning \"to survive\" is even younger found in late or ecclesiastical Latin for the first time in \n Ennodius \n The use of the noun by Cicero and Horace thus predates the first attestation of the verb \n citation needed \n It doesn't exclude that the verb might have been created and used after the name \n The term \n superstitio \n or \n superstitio vana \n \"vain superstition\" was applied in the 1st century to those religious cults in the \n Roman Empire \n which were officially outlawed This concerned the religion of the \n druids \n in particular which was described as a \n superstitio vana \n by \n Tacitus \n and \n Early Christianity \n outlawed as a \n superstitio Iudaica \n in AD by \n Domitian \n Superstition and religion \n Evolutionary psychology of religion \n and \n Evolutionary origin of religions \n Greek and Roman \n polytheists \n who modeled their relations with the gods on political and social terms scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods as a slave feared a cruel and capricious master Such fear of the gods was what the Romans meant by \"superstition\" Veyne p \n Diderot's \n Encyclopdie \n defines superstition as \"any excess of religion in general\" and links it specifically with \n paganism \n In his \n Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church \n Martin Luther \n who called the papacy \"that fountain and source of all superstitions\" accuses the popes of superstition \n For there was scarce another of the celebrated bishoprics that had so few learned pontiffs only in violence intrigue and superstition has it hitherto surpassed the rest For the men who occupied the RomanSee a thousand years ago differ so vastly from those who have since come into power that one is compelled to refuse the name of Roman pontiff either to the former or to the latter \n The current \n Catechism of the Catholic Church \n considers superstition \n sinful \n in the sense that it denotes \"a perverse excess of religion\" as a demonstrated lack of \n trust \n in \n divine providence \n and a violation of the first of the \n Ten Commandments \n The \n Catechism \n is a defense against the accusation that Catholic \n doctrine \n is superstitious \n Superstition is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes It can even affect the worship we offer the true God e g when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition Cf \n Matthew \n Examples of Superstitions and Taboos from \n Weird Tales \n Superstition and psychology \n Main articles \n Magical thinking \n Placebo \n and \n Effective theory \n Origins \n Behaviorism perspective \n In behavioral psychologist \n B F Skinner \n published an article in the \n Journal of Experimental Psychology \n in which he described his \n pigeons \n exhibiting what appeared to be superstitious behaviour One pigeon was making turns in its cage another would swing its head in a pendulum motion while others also displayed a variety of other behaviours Because these behaviors were all done ritualistically in an attempt to receive food from a dispenser even though the dispenser had already been programmed to release food at set time intervals regardless of the pigeons' actions Skinner believed that the pigeons were trying to influence their feeding schedule by performing these actions He then extended this as a proposition regarding the nature of superstitious behavior in humans \n Skinner's theory regarding superstition being the nature of the pigeons' behaviour has been challenged by other psychologists such as Staddon and Simmelhag who theorised an alternative explanation for the pigeons' behaviour \n Despite challenges to Skinner's interpretation of the root of his pigeons' superstitious behaviour his conception of the \n reinforcement schedule \n has been used to explain superstitious behaviour in humans Originally in Skinner's animal research \"some pigeons responded up to times without reinforcement when they had originally been conditioned on an \n intermittent reinforcement \n basis \" \n Compared to the other reinforcement schedules e g fixed ratio fixed interval these behaviours were also the most resistant to \n extinction \n This is called the \n partial reinforcement effect \n and this has been used to explain superstitious behaviour in humans To be more precise this effect means that whenever an individual performs an action expecting a reinforcement and none seems forthcoming it actually creates a sense of persistence within the individual \n This strongly parallels superstitious behaviour in humans because the individual feels that by continuing this action reinforcement will happen or that reinforcement has come at certain times in the past as a result of this action although not all the time but this may be one of those times \n Evolutionary / cognitive perspective \n From a simpler perspective \n natural selection \n will tend to reinforce a tendency to generate weak associations or \n heuristics \n - rules of thumb - that are overgeneralized If there is a strong survival advantage to making correct associations then this will outweigh the negatives of making many incorrect \"superstitious\" associations \n It has also been argued that there may be connections between OCD and superstition \n This may be connected to \n hygiene \n A recent theory by Jane Risen proposes that superstitions are intuitions that people acknowledge to be wrong but acquiesce to rather than correct when they arise as the intuitive assessment of a situation Her theory draws on \n dual-process \n models of reasoning In this view superstitions are the output of \"System 1\" reasoning that are not corrected even when caught by \"System 2\" \n Mechanisms \n People seem to believe that superstitions influence events by changing the likelihood of currently possible outcomes rather than by creating new possible outcomes In sporting events for example a lucky ritual or object is thought to increase the chance that an athlete will perform at the peak of their ability rather than increasing their overall ability at that sport \n Consequently people whose goal is to perform well are more likely to rely on \"supernatural assistance\" - lucky items and rituals - than are people whose goal is to improve their skills and abilities and learn in the same context \n Occurrence \n People tend to attribute events to supernatural causes in psychological jargon \"external causes\" most often under two circumstances \n People are more likely to attribute an event to a superstitious cause if it is unlikely than if it is likely In other words the more surprising the event the more likely it is to evoke a supernatural explanation This is believed to stem from an effectance motivation - a basic desire to exert control over one's environment When no natural cause can explain a situation attributing an event to a superstitious cause may give people some sense of control and ability to predict what will happen in their environment \n People are more likely to attribute an event to a superstitious cause if it is negative than positive This is called \n negative agency bias \n Boston Red Sox fans for instance attributed the failure of their team to win the world series for years to the \n curse of the bambino \n a curse placed on the team for trading Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees so that the team owner could fund a Broadway musical When the Red Sox finally won the world series in however the team's success was attributed to skill of the team and the rebuilding effort of the new owner and general manager More commonly people are more likely to perceive their computer to act according to its own intentions when it malfunctions than functions properly \n Superstition and politics \n Ancient Greek \n historian \n Polybius \n in his \n Histories \n uses the term \n superstition \n explaining that in \n ancient Rome \n that belief maintained the cohesion of the \n empire \n operating as an \n instrumentum regni \n Opposition to superstition \n Opposition to superstition was first recorded in \n ancient Greece \n where philosophers such as \n Protagoras \n and the \n Epicureans \n exhibited \n agnosticism \n or aversion to religion and myths and \n Plato \n especially his \n Allegory of the Cave \n and \n Aristotle \n both present their work as parts of a search for truth \n In the \n classical era \n the existence of gods was actively debated both among philosophers and theologians and opposition to superstition arose consequently The poem \n De rerum natura \n written by the Roman poet and philosopher \n Lucretius \n further developed the opposition to superstition \n Cicero \n s work \n De natura deorum \n also had a great influence on the development of the modern concept of superstition as well as the word itself Where \n Cicero \n distinguished \n superstitio \n and \n religio \n Lucretius \n used only the term \n religio \n Cicero \n for whom \n superstitio \n meant excessive fear of the gods wrote that \n superstitio non religio tollenda est \n which means that only superstition and not religion should be abolished \n The \n Roman Empire \n also made laws condemning those who excited excessive religious fear in others \n During the Middle Ages the idea of Gods influence on the worlds events went mostly undisputed \n Trials by ordeal \n were quite frequent even though \n Frederick II \n AD \n was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered irrational \n The rediscovery of lost classical works \n The Renaissance \n and scientific advancement led to a steadily increasing disbelief in superstition A new more \n rationalistic \n lens was beginning to see use in exegesis Opposition to superstition was central to the \n Age of Enlightenment \n

psychology \n According to Lee Ross and Craig A Anderson \"beliefs are remarkably resilient in the face of empirical challenges that seem logically devastating\" \n The following experiments can be interpreted or re-interpreted with the aid of the belief perseverance concept \n The first study of belief perseverance was carried out by \n Festinger \n Riecken and Schachter These psychologists \n joined \n a cult whose members were convinced that the world would \n end \n on December After the prediction failed most believers still clung to their faith \n When asked to reappraise probability estimates in light of new information subjects displayed a marked tendency to give insufficient weight to the new evidence \n In another study mathematically competent teenagers and adults estimated answers to seven arithmetical problems then were asked to check their answers with a rigged calculator e g a calculator yielding the result = it is actually About half the subjects went through all seven problems without once letting go of the conviction that calculators are infallible \n Lee Ross \n and \n Craig A Anderson \n led some subjects to the false belief that there existed a positive correlation between a firefighter's stated preference for taking risks and their occupational performance Other subjects were told that the correlation was negative Subjects were then extensively debriefed and given to understand that no correlation existed between risk taking and performance These authors found that post-debriefing interviews pointed to significant levels of belief perseverance \n In another study \n subjects spent about four hours following instructions of a hands-on instructional manual At a certain point the manual introduced a formula which led them to believe that \n spheres \n are 50% larger than they are Subjects were then given an actual sphere and asked to determine its volume first by using the formula and then by filling the sphere with water transferring the water to a box and directly measuring the volume of the water in the box In the last experiment in this series all subjects held a Ph D degree in a natural science were employed as researchers or professors at two major universities and carried out the comparison between the two volume measurements a second time with a larger sphere All but one of these scientists clung to the spurious formula despite their \n empirical observations \n Taken together such experiments lead to a surprising conclusion \n \"Even when we deal with ideologically neutral conceptions of reality when these conceptions have been recently acquired when they came to us from unfamiliar sources when they were assimilated for spurious reasons when their abandonment entails little tangible risks or

{"theme.id": 9, "title": "Codependency", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency", "depth": 1, "text": "Codependency \n Look up \n codependency \n in Wiktionary the free dictionary \n Codependency \n is a type of dysfunctional helping relationship where one person supports or \n enables \n another person's \n drug addiction \n alcoholism \n gambling addiction \n poor \n mental health \n immaturity irresponsibility or under-achievement \n Among the core characteristics of codependency the most common theme is an excessive reliance on other people for approval and a sense of identity \n Given its \n grassroots \n origin the precise definition of codependency varies based on the source but can be generally characterized as a subclinical and situational or episodic behavior similar to that of \n dependent personality disorder \n In its broadest definition a codependent is someone who cannot function from their innate self and whose thinking and behavior is instead organized around another person or even a process or substance \n In this context people who are addicted to a substance like drugs or a process like gambling or sex can also be considered codependent In its most narrow definition it requires one person to be physically or psychologically addicted such as to \n heroin \n and the second person to be psychologically dependent on that behavior \n Some users of the codependency concept use the word as an alternative to using the concept of \n dysfunctional families \n without statements that classify it as a disease \n Symptoms and behaviors \n Patterns and characteristics \n Enmeshed romantic relationship \n Dysfunctional family \n Recovery and prognosis \n Failed proposal for inclusion in DSM \n Controversies \n Further reading \n According to \n disability studies \n specialist \n Lennard J Davis \n historically the concept of co-dependence \"comes directly out of \n Alcoholics Anonymous \n part of a dawning realization that the problem was not solely the addict but also the family and friends who constitute a network for the alcoholic \" \n \"While not an actual diagnosis the term codependent was first used to describe how family members of individuals with substance abuse issues might actually interfere with recovery by overhelping \" \n It was subsequently broadened to cover the way \"that the codependent person is fixated on another person for approval sustenance and so on \" \n The concept of codependency overlaps with but developed in the mainstream independently from the older \n psychoanalytic \n concept of the passive dependent personality which is attaching oneself to a stronger personality \n \"Dependency\" is well-established in psychological literature Whereas early on \n psychoanalytic theory \n emphasized the oral character and structural basis of dependency \n social learning theory \n considered a tendency to be acquired by learning and experience and \n ethological attachment theory \n posited that attachment or affectional bonding is the basis for dependency All three theories have contributed to the concept of dependent personality disorder as defined by the \n Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n DSM of the \n American Psychiatric Association \n The definition and criteria have changed in the different versions of the DSM In DSM-I passive dependency personality was characterized by helplessness \n denial \n and indecisiveness and was considered a subtype of passive aggressive personality By DSM-IV there were nine criteria with an essential feature of a pervasive or lifetime pattern of dependent and submissive behavior The DSM-IV definition emphasized the excessive need to be taken care of leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fear of separation \n The codependency movement may have its roots in the theories of German psychoanalyst \n Karen Horney \n In she proposed that some people adopt what she termed a \"Moving Toward\" personality style to overcome their basic anxiety Essentially these people move toward others by gaining their approval and affection and subconsciously control them through their dependent style They are unselfish virtuous martyr-like faithful and turn the other cheek despite personal humiliation Approval from others is more important than respecting themselves \n Al-Anon \n was formed in years after Alcoholics Anonymous was founded \n Al-Anon holds the view that alcoholism is a family illness \n and is one of the earliest recognitions of codependency \n The expansion of the meaning of codependency happened very publicly \n Janet G Woititz's \n Adult Children of Alcoholics \n had come out in and sold two million copies while being on the \n New York Times \n bestseller list for forty-eight weeks \n Robin Norwood \n 's \n Women Who Love Too Much \n sold two and a half million copies and spawned Twelve Step groups across the country for women \"addicted\" to men \n Melody Beattie \n popularized the concept of codependency in with the book \n Codependent No More \n which sold eight million copies \n In \n Timmen Cermak M D \n wrote \n Diagnosing and Treating Co-Dependence A Guide for Professionals \n In the book and an article published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs Volume Issue Cermak argued unsuccessfully for the inclusion of codependency as a separate \n personality disorder \n in the \n Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n DSM-III-R American Psychiatric Association \n Cermak's book paved the way for a Twelve-step take-off program called \n Co-Dependents Anonymous \n The first Co-Dependents Anonymous meeting was held October \n Symptoms and behaviors \n Codependency does not refer to all caring behavior or feelings but only those that are excessive to an unhealthy degree \n One of the distinctions is that healthy empathy and caregiving is motivated by conscious choice whereas for codependents their actions are compulsive and they usually aren't able to weigh in the consequences of them or their own needs that they're sacrificing \n citation needed \n Some scholars and treatment providers feel that codependency is an overresponsibility and that overresponsibility needs to be understood as a positive impulse gone awry Responsibility for relationships with others needs to coexist with responsibility to self \n Codependency has been referred to as the disease of a lost self \n Codependent relationships are marked by intimacy problems dependency control including caretaking denial dysfunctional communication and \n boundaries \n and high reactivity Often there is imbalance so one person is abusive or in control or supports or enables another person's addiction poor mental health immaturity irresponsibility or under-achievement \n Some codependents often find themselves in relationships where their primary role is that of rescuer supporter and confidante These helper types are often dependent on the other person's poor functioning to satisfy their own emotional needs \n Many codependents place a lower priority on their own needs while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others Codependency can occur in any type of relationship including family work friendship and also romantic peer or community relationships \n Commonly cited symptoms of codependency are \n intense and unstable interpersonal relationships \n inability to tolerate being alone accompanied by frantic efforts to avoid being alone \n chronic feelings of \n boredom \n and emptiness \n subordinating one's own needs to those of the person with whom one is involved \n overwhelming desire for acceptance and affection \n perfectionism \n over-controlling \n external referencing \n dishonesty and denial \n manipulation \n lack of \n trust \n low \n self-worth \n Patterns and characteristics \n Codependency can occur in any type of relationship including family work friendship and also romantic peer or community relationships \n Enmeshed romantic relationship \n In a codependent relationship the codependent's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy \"clinginess\" where one person does not have \n self-sufficiency \n or \n autonomy \n One or both parties depend on their loved one for fulfillment \n Particularly problematic pairings include \n Personality disorder \n and codependent pairing \n Borderline personality disorder \n There is a tendency for loved ones of people with borderline personality disorder BPD to slip into \"caretaker\" roles giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives Too often in these kinds of relationships the codependent will gain a sense of worth by being \"the sane one\" or \"the responsible one\" \n Narcissistic personality disorder \n Codependents of \n narcissists \n are sometimes called co-narcissists \n Narcissists with their ability to get others to \"buy into their vision\" and help them make it a reality seek and attract partners who will put others' needs before their own \n Codependents can provide the narcissist with an obedient and attentive audience the perfect backdrop for a self-absorbed narcissist \n Among the reciprocally interlocking interactions of the pair are the narcissist's overpowering need to feel important and special and the co-dependent person's strong need to help others feel that way \n Codependent and/or impulse-disordered individuals and codependent pairing \n Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder \n ADHD \n Obsessive-compulsive disorder \n OCD \n Manic state of \n bipolar disorder \n Dysfunctional family \n In the \n dysfunctional family \n the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around \n Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority A parent can nevertheless be codependent towards their own children if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels \n Generally a parent who takes care of their own needs emotional and physical in a healthy way will be a better caretaker whereas a codependent parent may be less effective or may even do harm to a child \n Codependent relationships often manifest through enabling behaviors especially between parents and their children \n Another way to look at it is that the needs of an infant are necessary but temporary whereas the needs of the codependent are constant Children of codependent parents who ignore or negate their own feelings may become codependent \n Recovery and prognosis \n Not all \n mental health \n professionals agree about standard methods of treatment \n Caring for an individual with a physical addiction is not necessarily treating a pathology The caregiver may only require \n assertiveness \n skills and the ability to place responsibility for the addiction on the other \n There are various \n recovery \n paths for individuals who struggle with codependency For example some may choose cognitive-behavioral \n psychotherapy \n sometimes accompanied by chemical therapy for accompanying depression There also exist support groups for codependency such as \n Co-Dependents Anonymous \n CoDA \n Al-Anon/Alateen \n Nar-Anon \n and \n Adult Children of Alcoholics \n ACoA which are based on the \n twelve-step program \n model of \n Alcoholics Anonymous \n and \n Celebrate Recovery \n a Christian Bible-based group \n Many self-help guides have been written on the subject of codependency \n Sometimes an individual can in attempts to recover from codependency go from being overly passive or overly giving to being overly \n aggressive \n or excessively \n selfish \n Many therapists maintain that finding a balance through healthy \n assertiveness \n which leaves room for being a caring person and also engaging in healthy caring behavior is true recovery from codependency and that becoming extremely selfish a \n bully \n or an otherwise conflict-addicted person is not \n Developing a permanent stance of being a victim having a \n victim mentality \n would also not constitute true recovery from codependency and could be another example of going from one extreme to another \n A victim mentality could also be seen as a part of one's original state of codependency lack of empowerment causing one to feel like the \"subject\" of events rather than being an empowered actor \n Someone truly recovered from codependency would feel empowered and like an author of their life and actions rather than being at the mercy of outside forces \n A victim mentality may also occur in combination with \n passiveaggressive \n control issues \n From the perspective of moving beyond victim-hood the capacity to forgive and let go with exception of cases of very severe abuse could also be signs of real recovery from codependency but the willingness to endure further abuse would not \n Unresolved patterns of codependency can lead to more serious problems like alcoholism drug addiction \n eating disorders \n sex addiction \n psychosomatic illnesses and other \n self-destructive \n or \n self-defeating behaviors \n People with codependency are also more likely to attract further abuse from aggressive individuals more likely to stay in stressful jobs or relationships less likely to seek medical attention when needed and are also less likely to get promotions and tend to earn less money than those without codependency patterns \n For some people the social insecurity caused by codependency can progress into full-blown \n social anxiety \n disorders like \n social phobia \n avoidant personality disorder \n or painful \n shyness \n Other stress-related disorders like \n panic disorder \n depression \n or \n PTSD \n may also be present \n Failed proposal for inclusion in DSM \n Timmen Cermak M D \n proposed that codependency be listed as a \n personality disorder \n in the \n Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n DSM-III-R American Psychiatric Association Cermak reasoned that when specific personality traits become excessive and maladaptive and caused significant impairment in functioning or caused significant distress it warrants a personality disorder diagnosis \n Cermak proposed the following criteria for this disorder \n Continued investment of \n self-esteem \n in the ability to control both oneself and others in the face of serious adverse consequences \n Assumption of responsibility for meeting others' needs to the exclusion of acknowledging one's own \n Anxiety and boundary distortions around intimacy and separation \n Enmeshment \n in relationships with personality disordered chemically dependent other co dependent and/or impulse disordered individuals \n Three or more of the following \n Excessive reliance on \n denial \n Constriction of emotions with or without dramatic outbursts \n Depression \n Hypervigilance \n Compulsions \n Anxiety \n Substance abuse \n Has been or is the victim of recurrent physical or sexual abuse \n Stress related medical illnesses \n Has remained in a primary relationship with an active substance abuser for at least two years without seeking outside help \n Controversies \n Some scholars believe that codependency is not a negative trait and does not need to be treated as it is more likely a healthy personality trait taken to excess Codependency in nonclinical populations has some links with favourable characteristics of family functioning \n Stan Katz \n states that codependence is over-diagnosed and that many people who could be helped with shorter-term treatments instead become dependent on long-term self-help programs \n The language of symptoms of and treatment for codependence derive from the \n medical model \n suggesting a \n disease \n process underlies the behavior However there is no evidence that codependence is caused by a disease process \n citation needed \n In their book Attached Dr \n Amir

{"theme.id": 9, "title": "Conformity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity_(psychology)", "depth": 1, "text": "Conformity \n Redirected from \n Conformity psychology \n Conformity \n is the act of matching attitudes beliefs and behaviors to group \n norms \n Norms are implicit specific rules shared by a group of individuals that guide their interactions with others This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole and may result from subtle unconscious influences or direct and overt \n social pressure \n Conformity can occur in the presence of others or when an individual is alone For example people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television even when alone \n People often conform from a desire for security within a grouptypically a group of a similar age culture religion or educational status This is often referred to as \n groupthink \n a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception forced manufacture of consent and conformity to group values and ethics which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of \n social rejection \n Conformity is often associated with adolescence and \n youth culture \n but strongly affects humans of all ages \n Although \n peer pressure \n may manifest negatively conformity can be regarded as either good or bad Driving on the correct side of the road could be seen as beneficial conformity \n With the right environmental influence conforming in early childhood years allows one to learn and thus adopt the appropriate behaviours necessary to interact and develop correctly within one's society \n Conformity influences formation and maintenance of \n social norms \n and helps societies function smoothly and predictably via the self-elimination of behaviors seen as contrary to unwritten rules In this sense it can be perceived as a positive force that prevents acts that are perceptually disruptive or dangerous \n As conformity is a \n group \n phenomenon factors such as group size unanimity cohesion \n status \n prior commitment and \n public opinion \n help determine the level of conformity an individual displays \n Peer \n Social responses \n Main experiments \n Sherif's experiment \n Asch's experiment \n Varieties \n Informational influence \n Normative influence \n Minority influence \n Specific predictors \n Culture \n Gender \n Age \n Size of the group \n Different stimuli \n Neural correlates \n Peer \n Some adolescents gain acceptance and recognition from their peers by conformity This peer moderated conformity increases from the transition of childhood to adolescence \n Social responses \n According to Donelson Forsyth after submitting to group pressures individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement \n When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus they are experiencing \n compliance \n or \n acquiescence \n In turn \n conversion \n otherwise known as \n private acceptance \n involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision Thus this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority \n Another type of social response which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group is called \n convergence \n In this type of social response the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand \n In addition Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories Firstly an individual who does not conform to the majority can display \n independence \n Independence \n or \n dissent \n can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures Thus this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards Secondly a nonconformist could be displaying \n anticonformity \n or \n counterconformity \n which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion \n To conclude social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity For example a popular experiment in conformity research known as the \n Asch situation \n or \n Asch conformity experiments \n primarily includes \n compliance \n and \n independence \n Also other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries sports teams and work teams \n Main experiments \n Sherif's experiment \n Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group In his experiment participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light feet away They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved The trick was there was no movement it was caused by a visual illusion known as the \n autokinetic effect \n On the first day each person perceived different amounts of movement but from the second to the fourth day the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it \n Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society providing a common frame of reference for people \n Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations In an eyewitness identification task participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects They were given one second to identify him making it a difficult task One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community To the other it was simply a trial Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group \n Asch's experiment \n Asch conformity experiments \n Which line matches the first line A B or C? In the \n Asch conformity experiments \n people frequently followed the majority judgment even when the majority was wrong \n Solomon E Asch conducted a modification of Sherifs study assuming that when the situation was very clear conformity would be drastically reduced He exposed people in a group to a series of lines and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in of the trials \n The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial On average people conformed one third of the time \n A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious \n After his first test Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects \"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to persons \" \n The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject the subject became more likely to conform However the increasing majority was only influential up to a point from three or more opponents there is more than 30% of conformity \n Varieties \n Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three major types of conformity \n Compliance \n is public conformity while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected \n Identification \n is conforming to someone who is liked and respected such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source \n and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance \n Internalization \n is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately if the source is credible It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time \n Although Kelman's distinction has been influential research in \n social psychology \n has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity These are \n informational \n conformity or \n informational social influence \n and \n normative \n conformity also called \n normative social influence \n In Kelman's terminology these correspond to internalization and compliance respectively There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human \n psychology \n and conformity the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context \n For Deutsch and Grard conformity results from a motivational conflict between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct that leads to the normative influence and a cognitive conflict others create doubts in what we think which leads to the informational influence \n Informational influence \n Informational social influence \n Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations when a situation is ambiguous people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary in spite of panic Looking to other people can help ease fears but unfortunately they are not always right The more knowledgeable a person is the more valuable they are as a resource Thus people often turn to \n experts \n for help But once again people must be careful as experts can make mistakes too Informational social influence often results in \n internalization \n or \n private acceptance \n where a person genuinely believes that the information is right \n Normative influence \n Normative social influence \n Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans \n In addition to this we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants they are less liked and even punished by the group \n Normative influence usually results in \n public compliance \n doing or saying something without believing in it The experiment of Asch in is one example of normative influence \n In a reinterpretation of the original data from these \n experiments \n Hodges and Geyer \n found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants They include truth i e expressing one's own view accurately trust i e taking seriously the value of others' claims and social solidarity i e a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either In addition to these epistemic values there are multiple moral claims as well These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants the experimenter themselves and the worth of scientific research \n Deutsch & Grard designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately they were giving the correct one \n Normative influence a function of \n social impact theory \n has three components \n The \n number of people \n in the group has a surprising effect As the number increases each person has less of an impact A group's \n strength \n is how important the group is to a person Groups we value generally have more social influence \n Immediacy \n is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy \n Baron and his colleagues conducted a second \n eyewitness study \n that focused on normative influence In this version the task was easier Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second Once again there were both high and low motives to be accurate but the results were the reverse of the first study The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time similar to Asch's findings The high motivation group conformed less at 16% These results show that when accuracy is not very important it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval \n An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of \n friends \n as compared to six-person groups of strangers \n Because friends already know and accept each other there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse however generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other \n Minority influence \n Minority influence \n Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them This is known as \n minority influence \n a special case of informational influence Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty the chance of influence is small However a minority that makes a strong convincing case increases the probability of changing the majority's beliefs and behaviors \n Minority members who are perceived as experts are high in status or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed \n Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics A review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" an inconsiderate or negligent group member can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction \n Specific predictors \n Culture \n Stanley Milgram \n found that individuals in Norway from a collectivistic culture exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France from an individualistic culture \n Similarly Berry studied two different populations the Temne collectivists and the Inuit individualists and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task \n Bond and Smith compared studies in a meta-analysis and found that Japan and Brazil were two nations that conformed a lot whereas Europe and the United States of America did not as much \n Bond and Smith also reported that conformity has declined in the United States over time \n Gender \n Societal norms often establish gender differences and researchers have reported differences in the way men and women conform to social influence \n For example Alice Eagly and Linda Carli performed a meta-analysis of studies of influenceability They found that women are more persuadable and more conforming than men in group pressure situations that involve surveillance \n Eagly has proposed that this sex difference may be due to different sex roles in society \n Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent \n The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well In a study by Reitan and Shaw it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments \n Sistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias \n They argued that because stereotypes used in studies are generally male ones sports cars more than female ones cooking fashion women are feeling uncertain and conformed more which was confirmed by their results \n Age \n Research has noted age differences in conformity For example research with Australian children and adolescents ages to discovered that conformity decreases with age \n Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages to \n The results revealed a similar trend older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants \n In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status age has also been argued to have status implications Berger Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students Younger students such as those in their first year in college are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals \n Therefore given these status roles it would be expected that younger individuals low status conform to the majority whereas older individuals high status would be expected not to conform \n Researchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity \n Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age under years vs years and older gender and surveillance anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs not anticipating responses being shared on conformity to group opinions They discovered that among participants that were years or older females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance i e anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members However there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under years of age and in surveillance conditions There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance In a subsequent research article Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society She suggests that more submissive roles i e conforming are expected of individuals that hold low status roles \n Still Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals \n Size of the group \n Although conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number \n Moreover a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating \n This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong conformity will be motivated by normative influence the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response However conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response \n Different stimuli \n In Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines he conducted his study in Norway and France \n He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli and that in the case of tones there was a high degree of conformity \n Neural correlates \n Evidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex pMFC in conformity \n an area associated with memory and decision-making For example Klucharev et al \n revealed in their study that by using repetitive \n transcranial magnetic stimulation \n on the pMFC participants reduced their tendency to conform to the group suggesting a causal role for the brain region in social conformity In another study the mPFC was linked to \n normative social influence \n whilst the activity in the \n caudate \n was regarded as an index of \n informational influence \n The \n amygdala \n and \n hippocampus \n have also been found to be recruited when individuals participated in a social manipulation experiment involving long-term memory \n Several other areas have further been suggested to play a role in conformity including the \n insula \n the \n temporoparietal junction \n the \n ventral striatum \n and the anterior and posterior \n cingulate cortices \n More recent work \n stresses the role of \n orbitofrontal cortex \n OFC in conformity not only at the time of social influence \n but also later on when participants are given an opportunity to conform by selecting an action In particular Charpentier et al found that the OFC mirrors the exposure to social influence at a subsequent time point when a decision is being made without the social influence being present The tendency to conform has also been observed in the structure of the OFC with a greater \n grey matter \n volume in high conformers \n Psychology portal \n Sociology portal \n Authoritarian personality \n Countersignaling \n Cultural assimilation \n Milieu control \n

Training may be for purposes such as \n companionship \n detection \n protection \n and \n entertainment \n The type of training an animal receives will vary depending on the \n training method \n used and the purpose for training the animal For example a \n seeing eye dog \n will be trained to achieve a different goal than a \n wild animal \n in a \n circus \n In some countries animal trainer \n certification bodies \n exist They do not share consistent goals or requirements they don't prevent someone from practicing as an animal trainer nor using the title Similarly the United States does not require animal trainers to have any specific certification \n An animal trainer should consider the natural behaviors of the animal and aim to modify behaviors through a basic system of reward and punishment \n Methods \n The behavioral approach \n Principles \n Establishing new behavior \n Other considerations \n Service animals \n Film and television \n Companion animals \n Dogs \n Horses \n

Ursar \n drawing by \n Theodor Aman \n The behavioral approach \n Principles \n During training an animal trainer can administer one of four potential consequences for a given behavior \n Positive reinforcement \n Occurs when an animal's behavior is followed by a stimulus that increases occurrences of the behavior in the future \n Negative reinforcement \n Occurs when a behavior is followed by the removal of an aversive stimulus which causes the occurrences of the behavior to increase in the future \n Positive punishment \n Occurs when a behavior is followed by the addition of an aversive stimulus This causes a decrease in occurrences of behavior in the future \n Negative punishment \n Occurs when a behavior is followed by the removal of a stimulus As a result the occurrences of the behavior decrease in the future \n Behavior analysts emphasize the use of positive reinforcement for increasing desirable behaviors \n and negative punishment for decreasing undesirable behaviors If punishment is going to be used to decrease an undesirable behavior the animal must be able to receive positive reinforcement for an alternative behavior \n Establishing new behavior \n Reinforcement \n should be provided according to a predetermined schedule \n Such a schedule of reinforcement specifies whether all responses or only some are reinforced and includes the following \n Variable ratio \n A reinforcer delivery occurs after a set number of responses but that number varies around an average number \n Fixed ratio \n A specific number of responses occur before a reinforcer is delivered \n Variable interval \n Is the first response that is emitted after a set but variable amount of time has elapsed is reinforced \n Fixed interval \n The first response that is emitted after a set time has elapsed is reinforced \n While continuous reinforcement in a fixed ratio schedule may be necessary for the initial learning stages a variable ratio schedule is the most effective at maintaining behavior over long periods of time \n There are various methods animal trainers can use to prompt an animal to respond to a stimulus in a specific way For example shaping is a process by which successive approximations are rewarded until the desirable response topography is attained \n An animal trainer can use conditioned reinforcers like clickers to bridge the interval between response and positive reinforcement \n Some stimuli that is considered discriminative are signals targets and cues They can be used to prompt a response from an animal and can be changed to other stimuli or faded in magnitude \n In order to delay satiation reinforcer size should be as small as possible and still be effective for reinforcement \n Also the timing of the delivery of a reinforcer is crucial Initially the interval between response and consequence must be minimal in order for the animal to associate the consequence with the response \n Other important issues related to this method are \n stimulus control \n motivating operations \n Desensitization \n chaining \n S-deltas \n discrimination \n generalization \n Other considerations \n Certain sub-fields of animal training tend to also have certain philosophies and styles For example fields such as \n Companion bird training \n Hunting bird training \n Companion dog training \n Show dog training \n Dressage horse training \n Mahout elephant training \n Circus elephant training \n Zoo elephant training \n Zoo exotic animal training \n Marine mammal training \n The degree of trainer protection from the animal and the tasks trained may also vary They can range from entertainment husbandry veterinary behaviors physical labor or athleticism habituation to averse stimuli interaction or non-interaction with other humans or even research sensory physiological cognitive \n Training also may take into consideration the natural social tendencies of the animal species or even breed such as predilections for attention span food-motivation dominance hierarchies aggression or bonding to individuals conspecifics as well as humans Consideration must also be given to practical aspects on the human side such as the ratio of the number of trainers to each animal In some circumstances one animal may have multiple trainers in others a trainer might attend simultaneously to many animals in a training session Sometimes training is accomplished with a single trainer working individually with a single animal \n Service animals \n Morphy an \n Orangutan \n with his toy a horse on a walk with his keeper in a traveling circus \n Service animals \n such as \n assistance dogs \n Capuchin monkeys \n and \n miniature horses \n are trained to utilize their sensory and social skills to bond with a human and help that person to offset a disability in daily life The use of service animals especially \n dogs \n is an ever-growing field with a wide range of special adaptations \n In the \n United States \n selected inmates in prisons are used to train service dogs In addition to adding to the short supply of service animals such programs have produced benefits in improved socialization skills and behavior of inmates \n Film and television \n Organizations such as the \n American Humane Association \n monitor the use of animals such as those used in the entertainment industry but they do not monitor their training The \n Patsy Award \n Picture Animal Top Star of the Year was originated by the Hollywood office in after a horse was killed in an on-set accident during the filming of the \n Tyrone Power \n film \n Jesse James \n The award now covers both film and \n television \n and is separated into four categories canine equine wild and special \n One famous animal trainer \n Frank Inn \n received over Patsy awards While there is a high demand for mammals for film and television there is also a demand for other animals \n Steven R Kutcher \n has filled this niche for \n insects \n Companion animals \n Dogs \n Main articles \n Dog training \n and \n Dog trainer \n A trained dog competing in \n dog agility \n Basic \n obedience training \n tasks for dogs include walking on a leash attention \n housebreaking \n nonaggression and \n socialization \n with humans or other pets Dogs are also trained for many other activities such as \n dog sports \n service dogs \n and \n working dog \n tasks \n Positive reinforcement for dogs can include primary reinforcers like food or social reinforcers such as vocal \"good boy\" or tactile stroking ones Positive punishment if used at all can be physical such as pulling on a leash or spanking It may also be vocal such as saying \"bad dog\" Bridges to positive reinforcement include vocal cues whistling and \n dog whistles \n as well as \n clickers \n used in \n clicker training \n a method popularized by \n Karen Pryor \n Negative reinforcement may also be used Punishment is also a tool including withholding of food or physical discipline \n Horses \n Main articles \n Horse training \n Equestrianism \n and \n horse behavior \n The primary purpose of training \n horses \n is to socialize them around humans teach them to behave in a manner that makes them safe for humans to handle and as adults to carry a \n rider \n under \n saddle \n or to be \n driven \n in order to pull a \n vehicle \n As prey animals much effort must be put into training horses to overcome its natural \n flight or fight instinct \n and accept handling that would not be natural for a wild animal such as willingly going into a confined space or having a predator a human being sit on its back As training advances some horses are prepared for competitive sports up to the \n Olympic games \n where horses are the only non-human animal athlete that is used at the Olympics All \n equestrian \n disciplines from \n horse racing \n to \n draft horse showing \n require the horse to have specialized training \n A human with a trained horse and a trained Peregrine Falcon \n Unlike dogs horses are not motivated as strongly by positive reinforcement rewards as they are motivated by other \n operant conditioning \n methods such as the release of pressure as a reward for the correct behavior called \n negative reinforcement \n Positive reinforcement techniques such as petting kind words rewarding of treats and clicker training have some benefit but not to the degree seen in dogs and other predator species Punishment of horses is effective only to a very limited degree usually a sharp command or brief physical punishment given within a few seconds of a disobedient act Horses do not correlate punishment to a specific behavior unless it occurs immediately They do however have a remarkably long memory and once a task is learned it will be retained for a very long time For this reason poor training or allowing bad habits to be learned can be very difficult to remedy at a later date \n Birds \n Typical training tasks for companion birds include perching non-aggression halting feather-picking controlling excessive vocalizations socialization with household members and other pets and socialization with strangers The large parrot species frequently have lifespans that exceed that of their human owners and they are closely bonded to their owners In general parrot companions usually have clipped wings which facilitates socialization and controlling aggression and vocalizations Some \n birds of prey \n are trained to hunt an ancient art known as \n falconry \n or \n hawking \n In \n China \n the practice of training \n Cormorants \n to catch fish has gone on for over years \n Chickens \n Chicken on a skateboard \n Training chickens has become a way for trainers of other animals primarily dogs to perfect their training technique Bob Bailey formerly of Animal Behavior Enterprises and the \n IQ Zoo \n teaches chicken training seminars where trainers teach poultry to discriminate between shapes to navigate an obstacle course and to chain behaviors together Chicken training is done using \n operant conditioning \n using a clicker and chicken feed for reinforcement The training of chickens has become a popular event for dog trainers Trained chickens may be confined to a display where they play \n Tic-Tac-Toe \n against humans for a fee \n Fish and molluscs \n Fish can also be trained For example \n goldfish \n may swim toward their owners and follow them as they walk through the room but will not follow anyone else The fish may swim up and down signalling the owner to turn on its \n aquarium \n light when it is off and it will skim the surface until its owner feeds it Fish have also been taught to perform more complicated tasks such as fetching rings swimming through hoops and tubes doing the limbo and pushing a miniature soccer ball into a net \n Fish have been taught to distinguish and respond differently to slight differences in human faces displayed on a screen archerfish \n or styles of music goldfish \n and koi \n Molluscs with totally different brain designs have been taught to distinguish and respond to geometric symbols cuttlefish \n and octopus \n and have been taught that food behind a clear barrier cannot be eaten squid \n Wild animals \n Zoological parks \n Animals in public display are sometimes trained for educational entertainment management and husbandry behaviors Educational behaviors may include species-typical behaviors under stimulus control such as vocalizations Entertainment may include display behaviors to show the animal or simply arbitrary behaviors Management includes movement such as following the trainer entering crates or moving from pen to pen or tank-to-tank through gates Husbandry behaviors facilitate veterinary care It can include desensitization to various physical examinations or procedures such as \n Cleaning \n Nail clipping or stepping onto a scale voluntarily \n The collection of samples e g biopsy urine \n Such voluntary training is important for minimizing the frequency with which zoo collection animals must be anesthetized or physically restrained \n Marine mammal parks \n Many marine mammals are trained for entertainment such as \n bottlenose dolphins \n killer whales \n belugas \n sea lions \n and others \n In a public display situation the audience's attention is focused on the animal rather than the trainer therefore the discriminative stimulus is generally gestural a hand sign and sparse in nature Unobtrusive dog whistles are used as bridges and positive reinforcers are either primary food or tactile rub downs and not vocal However \n pinnipeds \n and \n mustelids \n sea lions \n seals \n walruses \n and \n otters \n can hear in our \n frequency \n so most of the time they will receive vocal reinforcers during shows and performances The shows are turned into more of a play production because of this instead of just a run through of behaviors like \n cetaceans \n generally do in their shows Guests can often hear these vocal reinforcers when attending a \n SeaWorld \n show During the Clyde and Seamore show the trainers may say something like \"Good grief Clyde!\" or \"Good job Seamore\" The trainers substitute the word \"good\" in the place of food or rubdowns when teaching a specific behavior to the animals so that the animals no longer need constant feeding as praise for achieving the appropriate behavior \n Field research \n On an experimental basis wildlife researchers have employed animal trainers in their interactions with animals in the field \n List of notable animal trainers \n Known for their influence on the \n circus \n Hanno Coldam \n Chief Animal Trainer with the \n State Circus of East Germany \n Brothers \n Vladimir Durov \n
