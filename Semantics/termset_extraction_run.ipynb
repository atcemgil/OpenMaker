    "\n",
    "This notebook sketches the initial exercise on identifiying a weighted set of key terms using a specific corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method outlined here aims to set-up a base line for future improvements. See the Assumptions and Suggested Future Work sections below.\n",
    " * It uses a statistical approach combined with standardized procedures widely applied in NLP workflows.\n",
    " * In this base line, it aims to present a work flow that can be ablied to\n",
    "     * different languages\n",
    "     * differrent problem domains\n",
    " * It relies on a domain specific corpus as a foreground corpus and a reference corpus as the background corpus\n",
    " * In this work flow specific corpus is formed via supervised crawling on the wikipedia\n",
    " * In the exercises below the NLTK's Brown corpus is used as the reference background corpus. However, in the next work round, we aim to use full Wikipedia corpus under the same language of the specific corpus or a reprsentative random sample of it. \n",
    " * The normalized comparison of candidate keywords within specific vs reference corpus is used as a proxy indication of the relevance of the candidate keyword for the given topic that is reprseneted by the collection of articles under the specific corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overall Work Flow\n",
    "In short, the workflow presented on this notebook is the second stage on a workflow objective of which is being able to measure relevance of a given external input to a specific theme, issue or topic. The steps of the work flow is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forming a specific corpus where the corpus consists of set of documents around a topic. The corpus could be\n",
    "    - a set of blog articles around an issue let say green finance\n",
    "    - or a set of Wikipedia articles around the same subject\n",
    "    - or collection of news articles around the green finance\n",
    "    - or collection of tweets around the same issue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    At the moment we have another module that given a set of seed Wikipedia articles around an issue the crawler scrapes textual data from articles. For the details of the module please [see the scraper module.](https://github.com/bulentozel/OpenMaker/tree/master/Scraping). The output of that module is a set of input texts stored in a collection in JSON format. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given an input set of texts on a theme a concept or a topic identify set of terms that more likely or less likely can occur within a discussion on the topic. This module hereby presents one of the simple methods for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Given a list of weighted terms which are more likely to occur or reprsent a theme, concept or topic and input query text measure the relevance of the input text to the topic/theme/concept. [The notebook in this link](https://github.com/bulentozel/OpenMaker/blob/master/Semantics/Score%20Text.ipynb) demonstrates one way doing such scoring of a given text against the curated set of terms of this particular module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Work-flow Process in this Particular Module\n",
    "1. Loading the reference corpus and a topic specific corpus\n",
    "2. Tokenizing and cleaning the reference corpus and the specific corpus\n",
    "3. Calculating term frequency counts of the reference corpus and the specific corpus\n",
    "4. Identifying common terms in both corpuses\n",
    "5. Identifying distinctive terms that occur in the specific corpus but not in reference corpus, if any\n",
    "6. Reducing the terms in the dinstinctive set by an iterative manual inspection process as well as by  using a curated list of distinctive terms on the topic.\n",
    "7. Computing likelihood ratio (empirical probabilities) of the terms that are observed in the specific topic\n",
    "8. Tabulating identified list of terms, their raw frequencies and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Suggested Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using language specicif term frequency counts of Wikipedia itself for comparisons. In NLP terminology, the *foreground* corpus around a topic needs to be compared and contrasted to a *background* corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improving the semantic crawler of the previous stage to be able to increase quality of the specific corpuses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding new scoring types that measures relevance of a given term to a given topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Improvements\n",
    "* Instead of tokenizing all terms, examine possibilities of key-phrase extrcation combining with *tf-idf* and \n",
    "    - experiment with extracting noun phrases and words, for this use NLTK's regular expression module for POS (part of speeach) analysis.\n",
    "    - extract n-grams where n=1,2,3\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Definitions and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "* In the current state of the task it is assumed that a document's terms tend to be relatively frequent within the document as compared to an external reference corpus. However, it should be noted this assumption is contested in the field. See the paper by Chuang et el.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Condidering the fact that the crawler is used to aggregate semantically related set of documents into a single document, *tf x idf* is equivalent to *tf*. As can be seen below, we use a normalized version of *tf*: *ntS / NS*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fewer number of but relatively more relevant training (input corpus) is prefered in order to reduce term extraction problems due to length of documents. However, it should be noted that the crawling depth of an identiefied wiki article from stage 1 of this document can be used as an additional weight on relevance/reprsesntation of keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have limited ourselves to terms instead of n-grams and phrases or use of POS to be able to develop a base model that can work on different languages.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Term\n",
    "Given for instance a set of texts around open source software movement a term that is identified can be a word such as *openness*, a person such as *Stallman* a license type such as *GNU*, an acronym for an organization such as *FSF* the Free Software Foundation, or a technology such as *Emacs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood ratio\n",
    "It is a simple measure computed comparing frequency count of a term in a specific corpus versus its frequency count in the reference reference corpus. Here assumption is that the reference corpus is a large enough sample of the language at observing the occurance of a term. Then having a higher/lower observation frequency of a term in the specific corpus is a proxy indicator for the term choice while having a debate on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood ratio for a term P_t is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P_t = log ( (ntS/NS) / (ntR/NR) )\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "- *ntS* is the raw frequency count of the term in the entire specific corpus\n",
    "- *ntR* is the raw frequenccy count of the term in the reference corpus\n",
    "- *NS* is the total number of terms in the specific corpus\n",
    "- *NR* is the total number of terms in the reference corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that frequency counts are calculated after having applied the same tokenization and post processing such as excluding stop-words, pancuations, rare terms, etc both on the reference corpus and the specific corpus.\n",
