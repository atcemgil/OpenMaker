# The OpenMaker Opinion Leaders API

This API is a prototype of a feature where OM-DSP users could be able to detect and explore the opinion leaders within the maker community.

The feature provided by this API could also enable the DSP leaders or accelerators to explore and follow other makers with specific non-technical concerns or focuses.

The API may enable the accelerators or other users of the DSP to check any Tweeter user's 'influence' on open-making related themes as well as be able to see their possible position on the opinion score board. 

The API connects to the WatchTower APP and retrieves the list of influencers. It also connects to Twitter API to retrieve tweets of the designated influencers. It analyzes the textual contents of the latest tweets of the WatchTower influencers' as well as any other designated Twitter user.

The APP has both a graphical (GUI) and a programming interface (API). Both interfaces are deployed on cloud server. They can however be run on local computer.

## GUI: OpenMaker Compunity Spirometer Offline version:
* Download the repository or clone it. Open [spirometer.html](./spirometer.html) from your local disk with your prefered browser. This is a datastatic version, that is, it doesn't connect to the OpenMaker WatchTower or Twitter for new profiling.

## GUI: OpenMaker Compunity Spirometer Online version

### Online Datastatic version:
Previously harvested and analyzed data is served. 
 * [http://178.62.229.16:5000/gui/datastatic](http://178.62.229.16:5000/gui/datastatic)

### Online live (limited by Twitter API and the cloud server resources.) version:
The live version can be used to query and discover additional Twitter user profiles on the OpenMaker spirals.
 * [http://178.62.229.16:5000//gui](http://178.62.229.16:5000//gui) or by starting with a twitter user:
 * [http://178.62.229.16:5000//gui/ausername](http://178.62.229.16:5000/gui) 
 
## Notebook:
A Jupyter notebook on the APP itself can be accessed [hereby](./OMLeaders.ipynb)

## Running on a local computer

After having created the python environment using the [requirements file](./requirements.txt), run the python script which is given via this repository.

Check follwing guides for creation of pyhton environments: 
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225900/how-to-pip-install-packages-according-to-requirements-txt-from-a-local-directory
- http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Once the repository installed on a local computer, , see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt), replace the "http://178.62.229.16:5000/" part of the URL below with http://127.0.0.1:5000/
